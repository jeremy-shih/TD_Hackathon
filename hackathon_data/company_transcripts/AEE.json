A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Fischer, you may begin.","Doug Fischer","Thank you and good morning. I am Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as well as other members of the Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details.

Marty will follow with more detailed comments on our financial results and outlook. We will then open the call for questions.","Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results.","In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60, which includes an expected temporary and negative impact reduce sales to Noranda Aluminum and we're pleased to announce updated rate based growth plans of approximately 6.5% compounded annually from 2015 through 2020, which is expected to drive earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020, excluding the impact of Noranda on 2016 earnings. We'll discuss these earnings expectations further in a moment.","Moving back to 2015 results, the strong 2015 earnings growth compared to 2014, reflected increased FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois Electric delivery earnings, resulting from infrastructure investment made under constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers.","The earnings comparison also benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy center and disciplined cost management. These positive variances were partially offset by lower retail electric and natural gas sales volumes, driven by very mild fourth quarter 2015 winter temperatures.","The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower allowed returns on equity and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Marty will discuss these and other 2015 earnings drivers in a few minutes.","Turning to Page 5, I would like to share my perspectives on our 2015 performance. Overall, I believe we delivered strong results for our shareholders and customers in 2015 despite facing several challenges.","These results were driven by successfully executing our strategic plan, starting with our focus on prudently investing in and operating our rate-regulated utilities, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks in order to enhance good reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage.","In fact, we invested $1.9 billion in utility infrastructure last year with almost 70% or $1.3 billion with this going to projects in our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses.","A significant portion of these investments was made in the Illinois Rivers project where construction is proceeding according to plan with work on the nine line segments and 10 substations well underway and some portions already complete.","The strategic allocation of capital and effective execution of these projects, coupled with disciplined cost management, contributed to a higher consolidated earned return on equity and this was accomplished while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility.","Moving down the page, we also achieved constructive December rate orders in both our Illinois electric delivery update and natural gas delivery rate cases. Further, we should not forget that earlier in 2015, we were successful in our efficacy efforts to extend Illinois' modernized electric regulatory framework through the end of 2019.","That extension had strong bipartisan support because Illinois' regulatory framework is encouraging greater investment and infrastructure, which in turn is delivering better reliability and more efficient modernized grid and significant job creation at reasonable cost to customers.","Since 2011, even with the substantial infrastructure we've made Illinois' residential electric delivery prices have increased at a compound annual rate, which is less than 2.5%. Simply put, the Illinois framework is a win-win for customers, the State of Illinois and shareholders.","Overall, efforts within each of our regulatory jurisdictions to create and capitalize on investments for the benefit of customers and shareholders are showing positive results. In 2015, we improved distribution system reliability and continued our solid base load energy center performance and our strong operating performance, combined with the fact that our rates remained well below regional and national averages, contributed to improve customer satisfaction.","The bottom line is that we're working every day to provide safer and more reliable service to our customers and we achieved this in 2015, despite challenging newer weather conditions, including unprecedented flooding and an ice storm.","While I am pleased with the results we delivered in 2015, I am particularly pleased that our team's successful execution of our strategy over the last three calendar years has delivered a peer leading total shareholder return of approximately 60%. As a result and looking ahead, we're going to stay the course and remain focused on executing this strategy.","Turning now to Page 6 and our 2016 earnings outlook, we anticipate 2016 earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The primary drivers of the variance between 2015 actual results and our 2016 guidance range are noted on this page and Marty will cover these in more detail a bit later.","I want to highlight that our 2016 guidance includes an estimated $0.13 per share reduction and net earnings anticipated to result from significantly lower electric sales to Noranda. I want to spend a few movements on this unique and temporary headwind that we face.","Moving to Page 7, here we summarize keep facts about Noranda\u2019s current situation and while we fully expect its impact on Ameren Missouri to be temporary.","First, you should know that Noranda operates in aluminum smelter in Southeast Missouri and they are our largest customer. On January 8, 2016, Noranda announced that production has been idled at two of the three top lines and its smelter operation following an electric supply circuit failure. So circuit failure did not occur on assets owned by Ameren Missouri.","Further on February 8, 2016, Noranda and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code due to operating issues as well as very challenging global aluminum market conditions.","At that time, Noranda stated that it expected to curtail all remaining operations at its smelter this March. Although it would remain the flexibility to restart operations should condition allow.","While we're working closely with Noranda and other key stakeholders on legislation to provide Noranda with long-term globally competitive electric rates, we can't predict at this time whether it will restart its smelter operations. As a result, our 2016 earnings guidance assumes Noranda will not restart any of its top lines this year.","We can and will take actions to mitigate the financial impacts of Noranda's outages on Ameren Missouri. Those actions may include seeking recovery of lost revenues in the context in electric rate case or filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission for an accounting authority order.","At a minimum in Ameren Missouri\u2019s next electric rate case, we expect the Missouri Commission would accurately reflect Noranda\u2019s ongoing sales volumes, thereby removing the related drag on our perspective earnings.","Pending conclusion of Missouri legislative process, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case this year in order to earn a fair return on investments made to serve customers. As a result, we fully expect the earnings impact from Noranda\u2019s lower sales to be temporary.","Turning to Page 8, here we know key areas of focus for 2016 as we continue to execute our strategy. Our FERC regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multi-value and local reliability projects included in our capital investment plan.","In addition, we will continue to work to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending that to FERC to seek to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners including Ameren Illinois and ATXI.","In late December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order in the initial complaint case recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE. We expect the final FERC order in that case in the fourth quarter of this year.","Moving to Illinois Electric and Natural gas delivery, Ameren Illinois will continue to invest in infrastructure improvements to upgrade systems to enhance reliability and safety including those under its modernization action plan.","This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019 including approximately 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters this year.","Turning now to Missouri where modernizing the regulatory framework remains a high priority. We've been actively engaged in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders including other Missouri investor-owned utilities to build support for legislation that would modernize Missouri\u2019s existing regulatory framework.","An improved framework will allow us to increase investment to replace and upgrade aging Missouri energy infrastructure to enhance reliability and customer service and to retain and create jobs.","Earlier, this month Senate Bill 1028 and identical hospital 2495 were filed with the intention of accomplishing these objectives. I will touch more on this legislation in a moment.","Finally in another regulatory matter, last week the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a new Ameren Missouri Energy Efficiency plan. This plan will begin March 1 this year and continue through February 2019 and follows on the heels of our very successful three-year energy efficiency plan completed at the end of last year.","We believe the new plan, which reflect an agreement between Ameren Missouri and other key stakeholders appropriately balances customer and shareholder interest. They composite this by providing for timely recovery of both energy efficiency program costs and revenue losses resulting from these programs.","In addition, the plan provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn performance incentive revenues, which would be $27 million if 100% of the energy efficiency goals are achieved during the three-year period with any such revenues recognized after the plan include.","Regarding Ameren wide initiatives for 2016, as you know the U.S. Supreme Court recently stated the EPAs Clean Power plan. This state blocks the plan's implementation until its legality is determined by the courts.","A three judge panel of the court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear legal challenges to the Clean Power plan beginning on June 2 of this year. We agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. It is in the best interest of our customers and the communities we serve because we believe it is important to know whether this rule will withstand legal challenges before steps are taken to implement it.","Of course we can\u2019t predict the outcome of these legal challenges, we remain committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion.","As a result, we will continue to advocate for responsible energy policies related to the EPAs clean power plan while working with key stakeholders to address important issues associated with the Missouri and Illinois state implementation plans toward the clean power plan ultimately be upheld.","Finally we will continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation with a goal of earning at or close to allowed ROEs.","Turning to Page 9, I would now like to discuss the recently introduced Missouri Legislation, Senate Bill 1028 and Identical Hospital 2495 would modernize Missouri\u2019s regulatory framework to support and encourage investment in aging energy infrastructure for all Missouri investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of their customers.","The proposed legislation calls for timely recovery of actual, prudently incurred cost of providing service to customers. It would also provide long-term globally competitive electric rates for energy intensive customers like Noranda.","Further, this legislation will include several customer benefits including earning caps and rate stabilization mechanism as well as provide incentives for utilities to achieve certain performance standard. Ultimately, passes of this legislation would be an important step forward for the State of Missouri.","This legislation would spur investment in aging infrastructure, support incremental investments in physical and cyber security, it's important environmental upgrades in cleaner generation sources as well as position Missouri\u2019s grip for growth in the future at a time when interest rates remain very low.","All this would be done while providing more stable and predictable rates for customers and other appropriate safeguards under the strong oversight of the Missouri Public Service Commission. Importantly, this legislation will create and retain jobs throughout the State of Missouri. It is a win-win for all stakeholders.","In upcoming weeks, we expect that additional language will be added to the bills as consensus building is advanced and the bills move through the legislative process. As a result, it would be premature to go through the specific details of the legislation at this time.","We're pleased that both Senate and house leadership are supporting this legislation, including key leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Utilities Committee.","Of course and as you know, the legislative process is complex and lengthy. We continue to work with key stakeholders to advance this legislation in a thoughtful yet timely fashion. The legislation session ends on May 13, 2016.","Moving onto Page 10 and our long-term total return outlook. In February of last year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a 6% compound annual rate for the 2014 through 2019 period.","Today we're rolling forward our multiyear plan and I am very pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at an even higher approximately 6.5% compounded annual rate over the new 2015 through 2020 period. I want to be clear that our new rate base growth outlook incorporates the effects of the recent five-year extension of bonus tax depreciation.","You'll recall that late last year, we noted that we were evaluating brining forward into our new five-year investment plan certain reliability projects, which total between $500 million and $1 billion.","Our team ultimately brought forward in excess of $1.5 billion of additional Ameren Illinois energy delivery and transmission reliability projects that have now been incorporated into our updated five-year plan.","As you can see on the right side of this page, we're allocating significant and growing amounts of capital to our FERC-regulated transmission businesses and Illinois delivery utilities in line with our strategy.","Our list of transmission projects is projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by approximately 20% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2020 period. In addition our Ameren Illinois investments are expected to result in projected natural gas and electric delivery compound annual rate base growth of 11% and 6% respectively over this period.","And finally our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. This level of Missouri growth incorporates increased mandatory environmental expenditures associated with co-combustion residuals.","Our updated five-year capital expenditure plan illustrates Ameren's strong pipeline of investment opportunities to address aging infrastructure and reliability needs that we've discussed with you previously.","And projects we've brought forward enable us to take advantage of the cash flow stimulus benefits and bonus tax depreciation for the benefit of customers and to more than offset the effects of bonus depreciation and projected rate base.","The utility infrastructure investments and projected rate base growth I just discussed will not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders.","We expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net negative effect on 2016 earnings of $0.13 per share as a result of lower sales to Noranda and we expect this growth will compare well with our regulated utility peers. Further we continue to expect compound annual earnings rate growth for the 2013 through 2018 period within the range of 7% to 10%.","Looking ahead we will also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. The Board of Director\u2019s decision to increase the dividend by 3.7% last October for the second consecutive year reflected its competence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings and rate based growth plan. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings.","Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","To summarize, we're successfully executing our strategy across the Board and I\u2019m firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve.","Again thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call and I\u2019ll turn the call over Marty. Marty?","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner. Good morning everybody. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation, today we reported 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared to earnings of $2.40 per share for the prior year.","We're pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that were just above the midpoint of our initial 2015 guidance we provided early last year despite some significant headwinds in the fourth quarter including extremely mild temperatures and the extension of bonus tax depreciation. As you can see there were no differences between GAAP and core results for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Moving then to Page 13, here we highlight factors that drove the $0.16 per share increase in 2015 results. Key factors included increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our Illinois and ATXI businesses, which increased earnings by $0.20 per share compared to 2014.","In addition the earning comparison benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center, which cost $0.09 in 2014. These refueling outages are scheduled to occur every 18 months.","Further earlier last year, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved recovery of certain Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage cost and this had a positive effect on the earnings comparison.","Earnings also benefitted from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower cost debt.","Finally, as Warner mentioned, we continue our ongoing efforts so relentlessly improve operating performance, including managing cost in a disciplined manner. Reflecting this, 2015 other operations and maintenance expenses declined, compared to the prior year for our Missouri utility.","Factors having an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons included lower retail electric and natural gas sales driven by mild weather. Weather effects decreased full year 2015 earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to 2014.","The unfavorable earnings impact of very mild fourth quarter 2015 temperatures is estimated to have been $0.08 versus normal, which more than offset an estimated $0.05 per share favorable impact of weather experienced over the first nine months of 2015.","Heating degree days were down about 30% versus normal fourth quarter levels. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers were flat year-over-year, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased about 1%.","The decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan compensated for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from energy efficiency programs.","Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by about one quarter of one percent.","For 2015, kilowatt hour sales to Illinois' and Missouri's industrial customers decreased approximately 3% and 4% respectively, primarily reflecting lower sales to large low margin Illinois customers and agriculture and steel making as well as lower sales in Missouri to Noranda.","Moving back to the discussion of 2015 results, the year-over-year earnings comparison was unfavorably affected by lower capitalized Ameren Missouri financing cost of $0.06 per share due to a larger balance of infrastructure projects in process and ultimately placed in service during 2014.","The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower recognized allowed ROEs, which reduced the contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois by a total of $0.05 per share.","Since 2014, our transmission earnings have been reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC.","In addition 2015, Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporated an 8.64% allowed ROE compared to 9.14% in 2014. This decline was due to a decrease in the annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.34% to 2.84%.","The 2015 earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by increased depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.05 per share and finally by the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost.","Turning to Page 14 of our presentation, next I would like to discuss details of our 2016 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 including an estimated $0.13 reduction related to a significantly lower expected sales volumes to Noranda, compared to 2015.","This estimated earnings impact is net of expected revenues from our system sales that Ameren Missouri makes as a result of reduced sales to Noranda. Revenues from these off system sales are allowed to be retained under a provision in the fuel adjustment cost.","This estimate incorporate such off system sales in and around the clock in the hub power price, net of an estimated basis differential, reflecting the location of our energy centers.","Further, we assume that the two of Noranda's three smelter pot lines that were idled in early January remain out of service. That the third top line is idled in March as Noranda has indicated and that all three of these production lines remain idled for the balance of the year.","Finally, as February 8 of this year, the date Noranda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Noranda had prepaid an amount to Ameren Missouri that exceeded its utility service usage. Ameren Missouri expects to be paid in full for utility services provided after February 8, 2016.","With this overview, I will now walk through key 2016 earnings drivers and assumptions for each of our businesses. Like 2015 results, expected 2016 earnings reflect increases in FERC regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base, which are noted on this page.","Our projected 2016 electric transmission earnings continue to include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO based allowed ROE, but also incorporate the 50 basis point adder FERC is authorized because of our MISO membership.","Further, expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula based ROE of 9% using a forecast of 3.2% for the 2016 average 30-year treasury bond yield.","For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, earnings will reflect new rates that incorporate the higher rate based levels and increased cost included in the 2016 future test year utilized to determine those rates as well as the higher return on equity authorized in the December rate order.","Shifting to a comparatively unfavorable item Ameren Illinois electric delivery earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share related to the ICC order approving the recovery of power usage cost that I mentioned earlier.","Before we move on, I do want to highlight that we recognized that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formula rate making and pending MISO complaint case. Therefore, on this page we've provided estimates of 2016 earnings per share sensitivities associated with hypothetical changes and allowed ROEs.","Turning now to Page 15 and 2016 key drivers and assumptions related to Ameren Missouri earnings. The year-over-year earnings comparison is expected to be unfavorably affected by the already discussed estimated net earnings decline related to lower sales to Noranda.","Further, as we noted on our earnings call in November, we expect Ameren Missouri\u2019s highly successful 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency program to reduce sales levels in 2016, negatively impacting earnings compared to last year. A portion of this impact will be offset by our performance incentive subject to commission approval.","I want to note that Ameren Missouri\u2019s new plan, which Warner mentioned and which becomes effective March 1, will not mitigate the unfavorable effects on 2016 earnings resulting from the prior energy efficiency plan.","There are certain key differences between the Missouri Energy efficiency program that ended in 2015 and the new program that begins next month. The 2013 through 2015 program compensated Ameren Missouri in each of those years for the mediate and longer term financial impacts of energy efficiency program initiated in each of those years, which is leading to 2016 financial headwinds.","For 2016 through 2019 program is again designed to fully compensate Ameren Missouri for the financial impacts of the energy efficiency programs; however, excluding the potential for performance incentive payment in 2019 in any given year, the impacts are expected to be earnings neutral.","The earnings comparison is also expected to be unfavorably affected by Ameren Missouri regulatory lag reflecting depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses that are higher than the levels collected in rates. Finally, a Callaway nuclear refilling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016 is expected to reduce earnings by $0.09 per share.","Shifting now to factors that are expected to favorably affect Ameren Missouri\u2019s earnings comparison. We estimate that other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms will decline. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management efforts.","Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions but this goal continues to be challenging assuming normalized annual level of Callaway refueling outage expenses, but exclude the net earnings impact of reduced sales to Noranda, we expect Ameren Missouri to earn 50 basis points of its 9.53% allowed ROE.","Before I leave the discussion of 2016 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to discuss our sales outlook. As noted on Pages 14 and 15, our return to normal temperatures in 2016 would benefit Ameren's earnings by a combined estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2015.","We expect combined Illinois and Missouri weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year, partially reflecting the previously mentioned effects of our Missouri energy efficiency programs that ended in 2015, the new 2016 energy efficiency programs as well as energy efficiency programs in Illinois.","Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt hour sales to this group are expected to be flat to up slightly compared to last year, excluding the anticipated decline in sales to Noranda.","Moving now to parent and other cost, during the fourth quarter of last year, we issued long-term debt at the Ameren parent company to repay short term borrowings. While this new long-term debt was issued at a low cost it will have an unfavorable effect on the 2016 earnings comparison.","Further, on an Ameren consolidated basis, we forecast our 2016 effective income tax rate will be about 38% comparable to the 2015 core effective tax rate. And finally, this earnings guidance reflects no change in average basic common shares outstanding from the prior year level.","Moving then to Page 16, for 2016, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $790 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of approximately $2.2 billion of planned 2016 capital expenditures with about two thirds in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks.","We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of cash on hand in short and long-term borrowings.","Turing to Page 17 of the presentation, here we provide an overview of our $11.1 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2016 through 2020 period. First let me provide further details on the type of projects included on our strong five-year growth plan and particular focus to those jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks.","The increased Illinois electric delivery investments will address aging infrastructure and support system capacity additions and reliability improvements. These include substation breaker and transform replacements, underground residential distribution replacements, line builds and re-conductor projects as well as capacity additions and line hardening.","Planned investment increases in Illinois natural gas delivery target safety and reliability improvements and consist of gas transmission, coupled steel system and gas storage filled compressive replacements as well as regulator station rebuilds and upgrades and other system rebuilds where conditions warrant.","And to add Ameren Illinois local transmission investments will enhance reliability and includes age and condition based replacements of structures, shield wire, conductors, transformers, breakers, switches and other equipment.","Of course in Missouri, we will continue to make prudent investments to provide safe and adequate service. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of income tax deferrals and tax assets over the five years ending in 2020.","The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures in the recent five year extension of bonus tax depreciation, which added about $930 million to this expectation. The tax assets totaled approximately $630 million at year end 2015 with approximately $430 million of these at the parent company, which are not currently earning a return and we expect these tax assets to be realized into 2021.","Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity through this planning period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity.","Now turning to Page 18 I will summarize, we delivered strong 7% core earnings per share growth in 2015 and we are successfully executing our strategy. We also expect earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year.","This earnings growth is driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution, generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdiction for the benefit of our customers.","When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren\u2019s dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.7%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Julien.","Marty Lyons","Hello Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So let's just walk first through here are some of the assumptions baked into your new long-term CAGR if you will, can you clarify the sales growth embedded in that and specifically here what I'm getting at is the latest energy efficiency program.","Is that factored in and to what extent does that impact your assumptions in the program? And then separately just you were clear about this, no cash taxes through that new period as well correct? And then perhaps a third point if you will, what are the assumptions baked in, in terms of the treasuries in that 5% to 8% period or 5% to 8% CAGR?","Warner Baxter","Sure Julian all good and reasonable questions. So let\u2019s start with the growth rates. As we announced today 5% to 8% expected compound annual EPS growth from 2016 through 2020.","Obviously the key there the big drivers rate base grow and as we announced today, we\u2019ve got 6.5% compound annual rate base growth planned for the period 2015 to 2020, which obviously is smack in the middle of that earnings per share growth range as well and that rate base growth is the foundation.","And we\u2019d say that -- I\u2019d say that that growth rate of 5% to 8% incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions.","As you know that over time in our planning, we look at consensus estimates for growth in the third year treasury rate, which today I think economists are expecting it to raise about 200 basis points between now and 2020.","But when we look at that growth rate range it accommodates a number of alternatives both that increase in treasury rates over time as well as even a low interest rate environment like the one we\u2019re in persisting over this period of time. So it incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions, ROEs, regulatory decisions, changes in economic conditions etcetera.","In terms of sales growth, our embedded in our forecast over this time is about flattish, sales growth through this period, but for the energy efficiency programs, we would expect to see modest growth, but as a result of the programs that we\u2019ve got in place, we do expect it to be pretty flattish over this period of time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it and then\u2026","Warner Baxter","Sorry, go for it. I was to say did I miss any of your questions?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Cash taxes just to be clear.","Warner Baxter","Yeah just to be clear with bonus depreciation, which is I mentioned on the call had an impact of more than $900 million we now don\u2019t expect to be a federal cash tax payer until 2021.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","That\u2019s what I thought excellent. And then just a brief follow-up if you will, what is the expected impact on the balance of your customers given what\u2019s going on with Noranda? How significant of customer inflation are we talking about here or potentially?","Warner Baxter","Yeah I think it's premature to really -- and it' pretty premature as I'd say get into that. We'll -- as we mentioned on the call, we're going to obviously watch the Noranda situation closely. Pending conclusion of the legislative process, expect to file a rate case and I think at that point we'll see what that impact might look like.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Last details since you mentioned it, what's the test year on that rate case you're thinking?","Warner Baxter","Really premature to get into that to Julian. Look, I think that what's happened with Nuranda and their outage is very recent, certainly unfortunate. We're watching the situation closely and making plans for the potential to file in that rate case, but it would be premature to get into what the test year would be at this time.","Clearly as we do think about that case, we're thinking about the situation with Nuranda also thinking about capital expenditures rate base that we have planned for later this year as well as other cost drivers of our business and so all of this things are going into our thoughts about the timing of that rate case and as you mentioned things like test year considerations.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I apologize, one slight clarification, you said 200 Bps over the period. That's 200 Bps over the 3.21 you embedded in your current year.","Warner Baxter","No I'm saying that I did. I think where economists are today Julien out in 2020 is around that 4.8%. So it's about not 200 basis points above where at the current 30-year treasury really sits today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning guys. ","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Paul.","Marty Lyons","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","On the long-term growth rate if you could -- how does the Missouri legislation -- proposed legislation get into this? Are we talking -- and the 2% rate base growth, does that include -- how does I guess let me ask you this, what's included in terms of the legislative, potential legislative outcome in the growth rate and that's what I'm asking.","Warner Baxter","Yeah sure let me Paul, let me talk about that. Consistent with the guidance that we've provided in the past and as you look at this new guidance it is not dependent upon any change in the regulatory framework in Missouri.","We've had about 2% rate base growth guidance in our prior guidance. We've got about 2% rate based growth incorporated into this guidance and as we mentioned on the call have incorporated into the capital expenditures in Missouri some incremental cost of compliance with environmental regulations.","But it doesn't -- the growth rate that we've got here both in terms of the rate base as well as the earnings growth doesn't -- isn't dependent upon some change in the Missouri regulatory framework.","Paul Patterson","Now before you guys have indicated and I think you suggested us today that your rate base growth has been stronger in Illinois because of the regulatory treatment, which it seems the Missouri legislation might give you something similar to that.","So is there upside potentially within this growth rate or would it be within the growth rate if you got the Missouri thing if you follow me. In other words how much rate base growth in Missouri might it increase if you were to get the legislation you're proposing.","Marty Lyons","Yeah sure it's reasonable question, I think it's certainly premature to speculate whether legislation would -- how much that might impact capital expenditure plans. I would go back to -- we feel very good about 5% to 8% earnings per share growth rate and 6.5% rate based growth rate.","We think those are very solid growth rates compared to our peers and to your point to the extent that we do have a change in the Missouri regulatory framework I think we have to step back and assess whether to the extent that we did have additional capital expenditures would they be incremental to this growth rate.","Or would we modify the capital expenditures plans we have and still delivered I'd say within this 5% to 8% earnings growth range. So look if that does take place, if there is a change in the framework we'll step back and we'll update as appropriate.","Warner Baxter","Thanks and Paul this is Warner. I would just imply I agree of course with everything that Martin just said, but no doubt that the one thing that we've been very clear about that if we have the ability to enhance this framework to support investment in Missouri, we will do so.","And how that fits into the context of the big picture plan, as Marty said that's something we'll step back and access. But we would expect to put more money to work in Missouri and we think there is significant opportunities to do this, to address aging infrastructure, to address things like reforms renewable energy, to address things like cyber and physical security, go down the line including some of the advance technologies that we're putting to work over in Illinois. These were things that Missouri needs and things that we would clearly be looking at.","Paul Patterson","And just to circle back on Julian's question with respect to the interest rate, the treasury, it looks like right now that we're talking about 30-year around 2.6 and I guess you guys have a higher number for this year and it doesn't look like it's that big a change in EPS.","But just in general how should we think about your projections versus what we're seeing right now. You said these economists are projecting this, but just you guys give a little bit more of a flavor for that.","Marty Lyons","Yeah. Sure Paul. So in the slides to your point we give a sensitivity around Illinois ROEs that have 50 basis point change in the ROEs is about 2.5% for our Illinois electric distribution business.","So to your point treasury rates today are lower than what we have embedded in the guidance. But we've had that situation before as well and certainly we have been able to deliver on our overall earnings guidance.","And so that $0.025 as I mentioned for 50 basis points $0.025 variants is not a large number but we continue to monitor it and we'll continue to manage our business around it.","In terms of the longer term, as I was saying the 5% to 8% earnings growth target but the foundation Paul is the 6.5% rate base growth and that 6.5% rate base growth as I said is smacked out in the middle of that range and that really anchors that growth.","And as I said then there is a range of treasury rates around it. Certainly not meaning to imply that it was -- we were dependent upon a 200 basis point rise in treasury to hit the midpoint of that guidance. The upper end to that range, the lower end to that range incorporates higher treasury rates or perhaps current or lower treasury rates.","So there is a range of treasury rate assumptions that go into that 5% to 8%. The midpoint again is anchored on that rate base growth at 6.5%.","Paul Patterson","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Marty Lyons","Sure Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Stephen.","Marty Lyons","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, just had one on energy efficiency. Marty I think you laid out I believe that effectively in the planet it should be a relatively neutral impact. There is some negative in terms of impacts to demand but you also have an incentive.","How do you think about the mechanics of that going forward relative to historical experience with it? In other words just do you see is it fairly balanced in terms of the upside versus the downside or for example is there a potential for upside given the $27 million potential incentive? How should we think about that as you bake that into your plan?","Marty Lyons","Sure Steve, I appreciate that. Yes, I would say the $27 million is there to be an incentive for us. So it's our goal as we go into these energy efficiency programs to really have these perform for our customers and we are incentivized to achieve the goals and we look forward to hitting the marks to be able to earn that $27 million performance incentive.","Between now and then, the way the new program is designed is to really be earnings neutral, that as we get these programs underway here in 2016 lead to the extent that there are negative impacts on our sales that those will be offset by revenues provided under the program.","We wanted to be clear on the call and hopefully were that in 2016, 2017, 2018, those programs shouldn't produce either in that positive or negative result. It should be earnings neutral over that period.","But like I said, we're incentivized to provide good programs to our customers, valuable programs to our customers and if we're successful in doing that, which we expect to be would put ourselves in a position to earn that performance incentive in 2019.","Stephen Byrd","Understood and already that performance incentive will be one-time payment in 2019, is that correct?","Marty Lyons","Yes, that's right.","Stephen Byrd","Got it. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you very much.","Marty Lyons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","\u2026and would you file for an accounting order around Nuranda and when could do you possibly click revenues or book revenues?","Marty Lyons","Paul this is Marty. I think the first part of your question may have gotten cut off. Can you repeat the full question?","Paul Ridzon","Sure. When do you expect to file for an accounting order in Missouri related to Nuranda and when do you think you could start offsetting the losses?","Marty Lyons","Yeah Paul this is Marty again. Yeah in the call I think what we have clarified was that there are couple of different things, one has to do with the temporary nature of this impact. And that ultimately it's a temporary impact because as we file a rate case and we incorporate the reduction the sales to Nuranda then that impact would go away in terms of the overall revenue requirements and our revenues will be formulate in the context for rate case.","What an accounting authority order would potentially allow you to do would be able to defer the impact of these lost revenues between now and when rates are reset for potential recovery of those costs. And we could either do that as an accounting authority order or also as we pointed out in the call, you could make that request as part of a rate case. So there is a couple of alternatives there.","I think one key is that it's not -- there is really no time limit on that meaning if you were to file an AAO it wouldn\u2019t just be for prospective impacts. You could also request it as part of that to recover the lost revenues from the date the incident first happened forward in time. So there is not really a clock ticking on that.","So we'll consider those options as I said before certainly very unfortunate what's happened with Nuranda here in January with the outage. They still have one part running. They've announced that they do expect to shut that down. But I think we'll let that play out and see ultimately what does happen and then consider these regulatory options that I just laid out.","Paul Ridzon","So there is $0.13 of potential upside to guidance if you're able to get some sort of relief?","Marty Lyons","It's theoretically yes. I think the important thing to know when we think about this being temporary is that we do expect to pending completion of this legislative process. We would expect to file a rate case and ultimately that's what we'll stem these financial impacts.","But yes, theoretically through the AAO or through the request as part of the rate case, these lost revenues could be recouped. However, you should know that that may not occur to the extent it does occur, it may not occur in 2016.","But again to the extent you requested this as part of the rate case, would be more likely that to the extent that those -- collection of those revenues was granted by the commission that, that earnings impact will be reflected in 2017.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys congrats on a good year. Just looking through the Bill in Missouri and I only looked at the Senate once, so if the house one is very different my apologies. There is not a lot of detail to the bill and so a lot of times bills will -- a placeholder will get published or put out and the bill will get flashed out over time. Can you talked to us about like what some of the incremental detail you would be seeking to add to that bill would be.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Michael, this is Warner and I'll start and then Michael Moehn and certainly jump in. I think a couple of things to think about. Number one that the sponsors of the bill, they thoughtfully consider whether to immediately file a comprehensive bill or as you say -- I would say an outline of key objectives.","I think that the objective there is to file the outline to give stakeholders the ability to provide input into certain approaches it might be utilizing the bill and so that's really where things stand today.","I think the outline is pretty clear in some of the areas that will be covered, but the specifics are still being worked out and so I think as you saw we talked about, we're clearly going to be focused on issues around addressing regulatory lag especially those associated with investment, that's outlined in the bill. Certainly important consumer benefits whether it be in the forms of earnings caps, rate caps or even performance standards similar to types of things we've seen successfully employed in Illinois.","And I think importantly what's embedded in all of that is strong oversight will continue by Missouri Public Service Commission. So it will be premature to go into details. I think those kind of specifics that are reflected in the bill that stands today, I would expect to see in the bill when it's found in its entirety and so when that is out, there will be a greater ability to kind of go in more detail with you and certainly the rest of the investors.","Michael Lapides","Got it and one other thing. When you're thinking about the potential and Warner you mentioned there are lots of opportunities for investment, when you think about the potential, is it kind of on the margin or incremental or is it significant and structural?","When I say significant and structural, I think what you've done in Illinois since the 2011 law passed has been a structural change in the investment opportunity in a single state given a change in regulation. Do you view Missouri as being a potential another Illinois or just having an opportunity for a marginal uptake in investment?","Warner Baxter","Michael, this is Warner. Look I think at the end of the day and we've had these conversations, I think there are several alternatives that are being considered out there. We've been clear in our conversations that we've seen the Illinois framework and how well it's working and how it's delivering for customers and the State of Illinois that's part of the conversation.","And of course there are other pieces of the conversation that are being discussed amongst stakeholders as well, but no doubt, we see the significant structural changes happen in Illinois and we see the significant benefits that's being delivered. Those kind of conversations are clearly being had.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks Warner. Much appreciated.","Warner Baxter","You're welcome, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Pruitt from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Glenn Pruitt","Hey guys. My question is regarding your transmission investment. So of the $3 billion that you have planned through 2020, I see that there is about $690 million planned for '16. How back-loaded do you expect the remaining investment to be?","Marty Lyons","Glenn, it's a reasonable question and I don't really have the full layout of the transmission. I'll tell you that overall though on our capital expenditure plan that it's pretty evened out over this period of time.","Obviously, one of the things we're looking to do over time is to be able to achieve steady rate based growth and so when you look at that $11 billion of overall capital expenditures that are planned for the five-year period, and you look at our CapEx today, which is about $2.155 billion, it's a little below the average of $11 billion of five-year spend.","So over this period of time, we're looking to spend in any given year I would say, anywhere between that $2.155 billion up to about $2.350 billion over this period of time and obviously again trying to achieve as best we can to steady rate base growth through time.","Obviously in Missouri, where you've got periodic rate cases that can be a little bit lumpier, but again over time, the goal is to have that steady rate base growth through the deployment of capital.","Glenn Pruitt","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian Russo","Hi. Good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Brian.","Marty Lyons","Hi Brian.","Brian Russo","In the event that you don't get the accounting order to cover for Noranda's lost sales, how should we look at kind of the general rate case strategy? I believe you said the legislature ends in May. So that would probably with or without legislation that would kind of trigger the rate case and then assuming what like a 12 month rate case process that puts you somewhere towards later first quarter of '17 or early second quarter for new rates?","Warner Baxter","Sure, let me -- the rate case processes in Missouri take 11 months. So you're right about when the legislative session ends. So we\u2019ll be thinking about those things as I mentioned thinking about again like I said rate base addition and the timing of cost to increase and things like that.","One other thing to think about with respect to Noranda and we mentioned this on the call is just how their rates are structured. Their rate is lower during the period of October through May at around $31 per megawatt hour and then from June to September its around $46 per megawatt hour.","So that margin differential and the impact on us is something we would be mindful of too as we look out to the conclusion of a rate case and when new rates would go into effect in the 2016 timeframe. So, those are all things that we would be mindful of.","Brian Russo","Thank you. And I think earlier you mentioned that embedded in your guidance is about 50 basis points of lag in the Missouri jurisdiction. Is that like the historical norm for you guys or is that due to the temporary or the O&M containment efforts that you are pursuing?","Warner Baxter","Sure, what we said in the call and is on the slide is that we expect to earn within 50 basis point of the allowed and it really is a factor of some of the lag that we are experiencing in 2016.","I mentioned the effects of some of the energy efficiency programs and some of the headwind we\u2019ve got there. Some of the other things we identified obviously on the call just ongoing depreciation, transmission cost, you recall that formerly we had transmission cost in the FAC, but they came out in the last rate case.","So as those costs have increased that\u2019s creating lag and then property taxes and so all of those things are creating headwinds as we roll into 2016. As I mentioned we\u2019ve worked very hard and we have plans in place to offset a good part of that with reductions in year-over-year operations and maintenance cost.","And obviously we don\u2019t give all of those details on the pluses and minuses on the call, but did want to provide you some frame of reference that net of all of those things and again if you exclude the Noranda impact, but you do go ahead and include a normalized level of Callaway refueling cost that we would expect to earn to within 50 basis points so that allowed.","Our goal going forward as it has been in past is just try to earn as close to our allowed as we can that remains our goal.","Brian Russo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felix Carmen from Visium. Please go ahead.","Felix Carmen","Hi, guys how are you doing? Just two quick questions on the Noranda thing, I know it\u2019s a temporary thing in nature, but can you just walk us through the high level math and how you get into the $0.13?","Marty Lyons","Yeah, sure. This is Marty again. In terms of the $0.13, we do have the opportunity as a result of the fuel adjustment clause to be able to retain margins on our system interchange sales that we make as a result of the reduced sales volumes to Noranda.","So when we look at it, we look at the differential between the rates that Noranda would have been paying and the price that we can get for those kilowatt hours in the wholesale markets.","When we look at that and around the clock price today and anyhow is probably around $27 per megawatt hour, but there is also a negative basis differential to our plans and frankly over the past couple of years that\u2019s been running 15% to 18% kind of a basis differential. So, those are the factors that we take into consideration and the calculation of that expected $0.13 drag on 2016 earnings.","Felix Carmen","Okay. So it does assume some offset from the wholesale sales.","Marty Lyons","Yes it does.","Felix Carmen","Okay. And then can you just provide us a little bit of guidance on how that's falls through the quarters in '16?","Marty Lyons","I guess the best I can tell you when you -- through the quarters is just again to go back to Noranda\u2019s rate and then you can go ahead and look at power prices, but the Noranda rate again between October and May is about $31 per megawatt hour and then during June to September its about $46 per megawatt hour.","So that's how their rates break down and then you got to compare it to what you think the off system sales price might be for each of those periods.","Felix Carmen","Okay. So there is some lumpiness that should be the assumption right?","Marty Lyons","Yes, there is some lumpiness and if you just looked at the Noranda revenues, you would say that the bigger impact would be in those summer months.","Felix Carmen","Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","This is Doug Fischer. Thank you for participating in this call.

Only the designation has changed.","With that housekeeping out of the way, here's Tom, who will start on Page 3 of the presentation.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2012 adjusted earnings of $2.42 per share, in line with both our narrowed November 2012 and our initial year-ago guidance ranges. This is a decline from 2011 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, reflecting lower earnings from our merchant generation business.","2012 adjusted earnings from our rate-regulated utilities were $2.29 per share, equal to the level achieved in 2011, reflecting on the positive side of a full year of the 2011 Missouri electric rate increase and the absence of a Callaway refueling outage in 2012. These positive factors were offset by reduced Illinois electric delivery earnings, reflecting a lower allowed return on equity resulting from low treasury bond yields and required non-recoverable program donations related to 2012 implementation of formula ratemaking. The regulated utility earnings comparison was also impacted by the negative effect of warmer 2012 winter weather on electric and gas sales volumes.","","Merchant generation adjusted 2012 earnings were $0.17 per share, a decline of $0.13 per share compared to 2011, primarily due to lower power prices and higher fuel costs. On December 20 of last year, we announced that we intend to exit our merchant generation business. As a result of this decision, we stated that Ameren expected to take a fourth quarter 2012 charge against earnings to reduce the carrying value of our merchant generation business's energy centers.","The 2012 GAAP loss of $4.01 per share, which we announced today, included both this fourth quarter charge and a first quarter charge related to the merchant generation business. Together, these non-cash impairment charges totaled $6.42 per share. Marty will provide more details on our earnings in a few minutes.","Moving to Page 4, I would like to highlight some key 2012 accomplishments. I am pleased to report that we posted our best safety performance in company history as measured by work -- lost workday away accidents. Further, our utilities recorded their best electric distribution system reliability performance in our history. In addition, Ameren Missouri's Callaway Nuclear Energy Center performed exceptionally well in 2012, running continuously since its November 2011 refueling.","We also had several notable regulatory accomplishments last year. We obtained FERC approval for constructive rate treatment of Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois' Spoon River and Mark Twain projects, greenfield regional projects expected to enter service in 2018 and forward-looking ratemaking for Ameren Illinois' electric transmission business. Ameren Missouri received a needed electric rate increase in December of last year, with new rates that became effective in January of 2013, and our merchant generation business won unanimous approval from the Illinois  Pollution Control Board for a variance to the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard, allowing all of its currently operating energy centers to continue operating through 2019 without derates or shutdowns due to state sulfur dioxide limitations.","Finally, the Edison Electric Institute honored both Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri with the association's Emergency Assistance Award, recognizing both utilities for their outstanding response in restoring electric service to New Jersey residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.","Turning now to Page 5. Today, we also announced Ameren's 2013 GAAP and adjusted earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.20 per share. The projected decline in 2013 adjusted earnings per share compared to 2012 reflects an expected loss this year in the merchant generation segment due to lower power prices as opposed to earnings before impairment charges in 2012. The midpoint of adjusted earnings guidance for our regulated utilities is $2.25 per share. Again, Marty will provide details regarding our earnings guidance later on this call.","Moving to Page 6, I will now update you on regulatory matters at our utilities. We continue to believe that modern constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide timely cash flows and a reasonable opportunity to earn fair returns on investments, are in the best long-term interest of our customers in the states in which we operate. These frameworks support our ability to obtain cash on a more timely basis to reinvest in our energy infrastructure and also attract capital on terms which facilitate timely investments to modernize our regulated companies' aging infrastructure. And such investments enhance reliability and the overall quality of service we can deliver to our customers, as well as improve the environment and help us meet our customers' and states' energy needs and expectations. All this ultimately helps us deliver on our customers' #1 priority, reliability, and also assists us in creating well-paying jobs.","As I previously mentioned, in December of last year, Ameren Missouri received approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission to increase electric rates. The amount of the increase was $260 million annually and was based on an allowed return on equity of 9.8%. These new rates went into effect on January 2.","Through this rate order, we did make incremental progress in our efforts to enhance the electric utility regulatory framework in Missouri. The Missouri PSC rate order meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs and enabled us to launch the largest energy efficiency program in the state's history. In addition, Missouri PSC authorized implementation of a new storm restoration cost-tracking mechanism that provides the opportunity to recover cost incurred to restore service after major storms in a manner that is both fair to both customers and investors. The Missouri PSC also confirms some key provisions associated with the fuel adjustment clause.","We continue to strongly believe that modernizing Missouri's energy policies to support investment in the state's aging energy infrastructure will clearly bring long-term benefits to our customers and the entire state of Missouri. That is why we, along with every other investor-owned electric utility in the state, strongly support the Infrastructure Strengthening and Regulatory Streamlining act filed in the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives a few weeks ago.","This legislation is intended to modernizing -- to modernize Missouri electric regulatory framework by providing for a more timely recovery of investments that are actually serving customers between rate cases. This legislation is largely fashioned after the infrastructure recovery legislation that has been utilized by the water and gas utilities in the state. The proposed legislation also contains a cost tracker for certain operations and maintenance expenses.","In addition, this legislation streamlines regulation while maintaining all the consumer protections in the current water and gas infrastructure laws, including very strong oversight and approval of these expenditures by the Missouri Public Service Commission before they are reflected in customer rates. Simply put, modernizing the regulatory framework in Missouri will allow us to modernize our energy infrastructure in a more timely fashion, enabling us to meet our customers' and the states' energy needs and expectations now and in the future while providing strong consumer protections and creating jobs. It's a win-win for everyone.","Turning now to Page 7 and an Illinois regulatory update. In 2011, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This act was designed to promote investment in electric utility grid modernization and promote well-paying jobs through establishment of formula ratemaking for electric delivery service. However, in our view, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, misapplied the act in our electric delivery formula rate orders last year. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that this formula ratemaking framework is constructive if properly applied.","We have appealed the ICC's formula rate orders in state court, and we are also actively seeking a legislative solution in a 2-pronged effort to address the ICC's misapplication of the act. We have taken these actions to ensure that the goals of the act are realized. Further, we support legislation recently introduced in the Illinois General Assembly, which would provide formula ratemaking for our Illinois gas delivery service. As with electric delivery, this legislation would provide a framework for accelerated gas infrastructure investment and job creation. Last month, we filed a request for an annual increase in gas delivery rates of $50 million. The case is based on a future test year ending in December 2014. The increase we are requesting reflects in part costs we are incurring in 2013.","Moving to Page 8, I will conclude my prepared remarks on our regulated utility businesses by updating you on a key driver of our expected future growth, our exciting plans to invest in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects. Customers should benefit from improved reliability in a more efficient electric system, and constructive formula ratemaking in place for these projects provides a reasonable opportunity to earn fair returns on investments in these businesses. Rates for both Ameren Illinois Company and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois, or ATXI, are updated each year based on a forward-looking calculation with an annual reconciliation based on actual incurred cost, a provision that reduces regulatory lag.","Also, ATXI has received FERC approval to include construction work in progress and rate base for investments in the Illinois River's Spoon River and Mark Twain projects, providing timely cash returns on investments.","Given the customer benefits our transmission projects should provide, and FERC's constructive regulatory framework, we continue to move forward with plans to invest meaningful incremental capital in these businesses.","In fact, Ameren expects to invest a total of approximately $2.2 billion in FERC-regulated transmission projects over a 5-year period ending in 2017. Ameren Illinois' projects are focused on local load growth, and reliability needs and investments is expected to approximate $1 billion over the same 5-year period.","ATXI is focused on greenfield regional transmission projects initially within Illinois and Missouri and plans to invest approximately $1.2 billion over the next 5 years. Our single largest planned transmission investment is ATXI's Illinois Rivers project. This important MISO-approved regional multi-value project involves a construction of a new high-voltage transmission line across the state of Illinois. It will enhance reliability and create new construction jobs in the state.","In November 2012, we filed a request with the ICC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the approximately 400-mile transmission line route, with a decision on our request expected to be issued in August of this year. Once we receive the certificate from the ICC, we will begin to acquire rights-of-way for the transmission line, with a full range of construction activities expected to begin in 2014.","Turning to Page 9, I would like to close my prepared remarks with a discussion of our merchant generation business. In December of last year, we announced that we intend to exit this business. Ameren no longer considers merchant generation to be a core component of its future business strategy. The volatility of earnings and cash flows of the merchant generation business, as well as the high degree of uncertainty regarding future returns on incremental capital invested in this business, are not in alignment with Ameren's current strategy.  The announcement of our intent to exit the business follows a trend of decreasing earnings and cash flows from this segment since 2008.","The timing and method of our exit from the merchant generation business is uncertain, with a sale or [ph] restructuring possible. In considering our path forward, senior management and the Board of Directors are focused on maximizing the overall benefit to Ameren, consistent with our legal obligations. While we are working to exit the merchant generation business in a prudent manner, let me reassure you that our management team remains highly focused on our regulated utilities, including growing our investments in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks so that we may better serve customers.","I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 10 of the presentation. As Tom discussed, today we reported 2012 GAAP loss of $4.01 per share compared to 2011 GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. This 2012 GAAP loss reflects the previously discussed impairment charges resulting from the write-downs of the merchant generation business' energy centers. Excluding the items noted on this page, Ameren recorded 2012 adjusted earnings of $2.42 per share compared with 2011 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share.","On Page 11, we list key factors that drove the $0.14 per share decrease in 2012 adjusted earnings compared to 2011 adjusted earnings. The combined 2012 adjusted earnings results from our regulated utilities, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and ATXI, were $2.29 per share, unchanged from the level achieved in 2011. These flat regulated utility results reflected on the positive side of full year of the July 2011 Missouri electric rate increase and the January 2012 Illinois gas rate increase; the absence of a Callaway refueling in 2012 compared to 2011; and the 2012 favorable FERC order related to a disputed power purchase agreement, which expired in 2009, among other factors. These positive factors were offset by reduced Illinois electric delivery earnings, reflecting a lower allowed return on equity resulting from low treasury bond yields and required non-recoverable program donations related to 2012 implementation of formula ratemaking, among other things.","Other factors negatively impacting the comparison of 2012 earnings to 2011 earnings included higher depreciation and tax expenses at Ameren Missouri. This higher depreciation expense reflected increased plant investment, while tax expense increased due to a higher effective income tax rate and increased property taxes.","Finally, weather had a negative impact on both electric and gas sales volumes, reducing 2012 earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share compared to 2011. Winter weather was much warmer in 2012 than the near-normal temperatures experienced in 2011, more than offsetting the slightly positive earnings impact of 2012 summer temperatures. They were close to those experienced in 2011. While weather had a negative impact on the year-over-year earnings comparison, we estimate that weather benefited 2012 earnings by $0.09 per share compared to normal temperatures.","Absent from this list of key 2012 earnings variance drivers is a change in weather-normalized retail electric sales volumes. Such sales to residential and commercial customers increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This was a definite improvement from the 1.5% decline experienced in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.","Full year 2012 weather-normalized sales to residential and commercial customers declined about 0.6%. However, this was partially offset by a 2.1% increase in sales to industrial customers, with higher industrial sales in Illinois more than offsetting lower industrial sales in Missouri.","Overall, we estimate that the weather-normalized retail electric sales volume decline reduced 2012 earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to 2011. While adjusted 2012 regulated earnings were unchanged compared to 2011, adjusted earnings from our merchant generation business declined $0.13 per share compared again to 2011. This was primarily the result of lower power prices and higher per-megawatt hour fuel costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and Operations & Maintenance expenses. These expense reductions primarily reflected the closure of the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers at year end 2011 and the first quarter 2012 impairment charge related to the Duck Creek energy center.","Tuning to Page 12. I would now like to discuss the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2013 earnings guidance for our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses. The midpoint of our guidance is $2.25 per share. In 2013, we expect to achieve an earned return of equity of approximately 9.1% on regulated utility common equity of approximately $6 billion. This guidance assumes a return to normal weather, reducing earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to 2012 results. On a weather-normalized basis, we project little electric sales growth in 2013 compared to last year. Also, Ameren Missouri earnings will reflect the absence of the favorable 2012 FERC order relating to the disputed power agreement, reducing 2013 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2012. In addition, 2013 earnings will be impacted by the Missouri electric rate increase that went into effect last month, including the impacts of the MEEIA settlement regarding enhanced energy efficiency programs.","Ameren Missouri's Callaway Nuclear Energy Center has a scheduled spring 2013 refueling and maintenance outage. This is expected to reduce 2013 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share compared to 2012 since there was no refueling outage last year. In addition, Illinois gas delivery and Missouri Operations & Maintenance cost beyond those resulting from the Callaway refueling are also expected to increase in 2013. This O&M increase includes a $7 million budgeted increase in Missouri storm costs, an amount which was incorporated into the December 2012 rate order and is subject to the new storm restoration cost tracker.","Turning then to Page 13, we continue our discussion of the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2013 regulated utility earnings guidance. Our guidance incorporates our formula ratemaking expectations for our Illinois electric delivery business. Our earnings expectations for this business are based on an estimated 2013 year end rate base of $2.06 billion; an equity ratio of 51%; and an estimated formula midpoint allowed return on equity of 8.9%, which incorporates a forecasted 2013 average 30-year treasury yield of 3.1%. This treasury yield forecast is based on the Blue Chip consensus estimate as of January 1, 2013.","Further, our guidance reflects the fact that several types of costs are non-recoverable in rates. These non-recoverable cost include approximately $8 million of ICC ratemaking adjustments. In addition, we expect to spend about $7 million this year on certain electric system rework that is not recoverable in rates. And finally, approximately $1 million of non-recoverable donations are required under the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, a reduction of $7.5 million -- or improvement of $7.5 million compared to 2012. We also expect higher transmission earnings from Ameren Illinois and ATXI in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting rate base growth and reduced regulatory lag, reflecting implementation of forward-looking FERC ratemaking with annual reconciliations for Ameren Illinois in 2013.","Moving to Page 14. I will conclude the discussion of 2013 earnings guidance by briefly touching on the merchant generation business and other category. Here, we expect a midpoint loss of $0.15 per share. The most significant driver of the expected earnings decline in 2013 compared to 2012 is a decrease in merchant generation margins of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, primarily due to lower realized power prices.","We project 2013 merchant generation non-fuel Operations & Maintenance expenses will be approximately $270 million. Depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $0.17 per share lower in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of the 2012 impairment charges. Regarding key Ameren-wide assumptions, our earnings guidance reflects in an effective consolidated income tax rate of approximately 38%, and the average number of common shares outstanding in 2013 is forecasted to be unchanged at 242.6 million since our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plans are expected to purchase shares on the open market this year, as was the case last year.","As I close our discussion of 2013 earnings guidance, I'll remind you that any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings but are excluded from our GAAP earning guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings and guidance also exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.","Further, earnings guidance is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in the Forward-looking Statements section of today's press release.","Turning then to Page 15. We provide both our actual 2012 and projected 2013 cash flow information. As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our cash flows from operating activities and subtracting from it our capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends and net advances for construction.","In 2012, we experienced negative free cash flow of $12 million. For 2013, we anticipate negative free cash flow of $435 million. The projected decline in free cash flow compared to last year reflects lower expected cash flows from operating activities and higher expected capital spending.","Cash flow from operating activities is expected to decline compared to 2012, primarily due to lower adjusted earnings in our merchant generation segment. The higher 2013 capital expenditures reflect increased expected spending at our regulated utilities, partially offset by lower expected spending at the merchant generation business. We expect 2013 free cash flow to be negative for Ameren's regulated utilities, reflecting the significant investments we are making in these businesses. However, we expect both the merchant generation business segment and Ameren Energy Generating Company, or GENCO, to be roughly cash flow neutral in 2013, presuming continued Ameren ownership of the merchant generation business and\/or GENCO. These expectations incorporate approximately $100 million for the merchant generation segment and approximately $60 million for GENCO of expected cash benefits from the Ameren tax allocation agreement. These actual -- the actual level of cash tax sharing benefits realized is subject to the realization of forecasted levels of taxable income or loss at Ameren and its subsidiaries. Further, these free cash flow estimates assume 2013 merchant generation segment and GENCO cash capital expenditures of approximately $50 million and approximately $45 million, respectively.","Moving from a discussion of earnings and cash flow, I would like to comment on the recently received Missouri electric rate order and the recently filed Illinois gas delivery rating -- rate request.","Turning to Page 16 of our presentation. As Tom already mentioned, in December of last year, the Missouri PSC approved an approximately $260 million annual increase in Ameren Missouri's retail electric rates. Of this amount, approximately $84 million is for recovery of higher net fuel costs, and approximately $80 million is related to the enhanced energy efficiency programs approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission in an August 2012 settlement. Among other things, the order incorporated a 9.8% allowed return on equity and continued the fuel adjustment clause with its 95-5 sharing split.","Tom previously discussed several important aspects of this rate order, and I refer you to the information on pages 16 and 17 of our presentation for more details on this rate order.","Moving now to Page 18. Last month, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC for a $50 million annual increase in natural gas delivery service rates based on a future test year ended December 31, 2014. The ICC is required to issue an order in December of 2013, with new rates expected to be effective late that month. The key drivers of this request are rate base growth reflecting additional investment in plant, higher operating expenses, a requested increase in the allowed return on equity and lower usage by residential and small non-residential customers.","Turning to Page 19, other aspects of the request include a proposal to increase to 85% from the current 80% proportion of the gas delivery revenue requirement as collected through the fixed monthly charge. This change would provide greater stability to customers' delivery rates and greater stability to Ameren Illinois' gas margins. We have also requested approval of an approximately $80 million plan to install advanced gas metering infrastructure over the 2014 through 2019 period, similar to the period over which we will be installing advanced electric metering infrastructure in Illinois. The concurrent installation of these systems for customers to whom Ameren Illinois provides both services will be cost beneficial.","Moving to Page 20, I will summarize our projections for growing Ameren's investment in the regulated utility businesses over the 5-year period ending 2017. As you can see, we plan to allocate a growing and substantial portion of our investment dollars to utility businesses operating under constructive, formula-based regulatory frameworks. Nearly 30% of our planned 5-year $8.1 billion of regulated utility investment is slated for FERC-regulated transmission projects at Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Another 30% of planned investments for the 5-year period is for our Illinois electric and gas delivery services. We are also making meaningful ongoing investments in our Missouri utility operations, but these investments are expected to grow at a much slower rate than those in the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery businesses. However, as Tom mentioned earlier, we do believe it is in our customers' best long-term interest to grow our investments in our Missouri operations at a greater rate if the regulatory framework is modernized so that regulatory lag can be minimized.","Turning to Page 21, we show that these aggregate regulated capital investment plans translate into expected rate base growth of approximately 7% annually from 2013 through 2017. With this growth most rapid in regulatory jurisdictions with constructive formula ratemaking, we believe we are on a path that will enhance our ability to earn fair returns on a growing level of utility investment.","Moving to Page 22, I will conclude my prepared remarks by discussing our intention to exit the merchant generation business. As we stated back in December, we have begun planning to reduce and ultimately eliminate over time merchant generation's reliance on Ameren's shared services and financial support as a result of our decision to exit the business. We are focused on making this transition in an orderly manner. Ameren currently provides at cost approximately $30 million annually of shared services such as IT systems, finance, accounting and human resources to the merchant generation business. In addition, Ameren provides various forms of financial support to the merchant generation business segment. This support includes a non-rate regulated money pool under which merchant generation units may have access, at Ameren's discretion, to short-term intercompany borrowings. At year end 2012, GENCO had no borrowings from this money pool. In fact, it had $25 million of cash or equivalents on hand and was a lender to the money pool.","Other financial support to the merchant generation business includes guarantees and credit support for coal supply contracts and guarantees for Ameren Energy Marketing energy contracts. Details of these guarantees and credit support will be provided in our 10-K.","Further, Ameren guarantees AERG's obligations under the put option arrangements between GENCO and AERG. I would note that Ameren and AERG do not expect to extend the put option beyond its March 28, 2014 expiration. Of course, we will update you on our plans to exit the merchant generation business as appropriate over time.","That concludes my prepared remarks. We will now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just touch on the disclosure, and thank you for the additional disclosure on the merchant business, as well as the increased spending at the utility. Regarding the merchant business, can you just discuss a little bit further whether you're taking action to actively evaluate strategic alternatives for the business? Or are you still more on the assessment phase? Is this something that is taking time with management? Is this something that you're actively pursuing at this time?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Stephen. I'll see if I can expand a little bit. Obviously, we put out the 8-K, suggesting that we expected to exit from the business. I think one of the things we tried today was to provide clarity that, that exit could take the form of either sale or restructuring. And as you would expect, management is spending time and attention with respect to those exit strategies and exit possibilities.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And just as a follow-up, you laid out shared services, which was helpful. Presuming that you did have a complete exit from merchant generation, should we assume that, that $30 million would not effectively be transferred back to the parent but would effectively -- no longer be an expense to the parent because those services are truly allocated and dedicated to the merchant business?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Stephen. We would expect that in the event of a merchant exit, that, that cost -- the cost, that $30 million could be substantially eliminated.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Substantially eliminated? So does that mean when you look at that $30 million, that it is -- that, that truly is allocated and you wouldn't see a substantial portion coming back to the parent?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. I guess what I'm saying is a large part of that is dedicated specifically to support of the merchant business. And so in the event of the exit, much of that cost could be eliminated. And so yes, that is what I'm saying, is that we would work to eliminate -- reduce and eliminate those costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Listen. On the guarantees and credit support for the coal contracts and for the Ameren Energy Marketing energy contracts, you mentioned that there's going to be some disclosure in the 10-K. Could you give us a general sense as to what the level of those obligations might be?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Sure, Paul. I think that -- and we did list it in the script the way you said it. But I would say that these guarantees are actually primarily on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing. And the extent of those right now, I'd say, is about $200 million of guarantees. And like I said, it's primarily for power transactions. The actual mark-to-market exposure under those is only about $25 million. But that's the -- I think that gives you a general sense of the scope. And again, there will be more details on the 10-K.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the CapEx numbers that you're mentioning at the utility and the fact that you're negative free cash flow there, should -- how should we think about the financing going forward? Because it looks like you guys have a lot of CapEx forecasted, if you're having your rate base go that much. How should we think about the financing and specifically, the potential for equity or equity-like financing in the next couple of years?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure. Well, when you look at the debt financing, I guess a couple of things. One of the things we've talked about over time is looking to keep the cap structures of our regulated entities in that range of, say, 50% to 53% equity, which is something that we would work to do over time. As you look at this next year and the negative $435 million, a couple of things to look at. One, we did finish the year with no borrowings under our credit facilities, a couple hundred million dollars of cash on hand as we go into next year. We would also look over time -- as we have in the past, we have the earnings and the regulated businesses that produced retained earnings, which are in excess of the dividends that we pay out. So there's -- those retained earnings are there to again build equity in the regulated businesses such that then we can also do some debt financing to cover this -- some of this cash flow shortfall. That said, as we move through time, like I said, we will look to keep those cap structures in that 50% to 53% range in terms of equity. Right now, we're not issuing shares under the drip of 401(k). As we mentioned on the call, we don't have -- we don't anticipate doing that in 2013. But as we move into 2014 and beyond, it's certainly a possibility that we would begin again issuing stock associated with those drip and 401(k) programs in order to keep the equity content within the regulated entities in that 50% to 53% range.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Any sense as to how much those drips would be?","Martin J. Lyons","Historically, Paul, they were in the $75 million to $100 million range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","First of all, I just want to congratulate -- I would just want to congratulate the senior management and Tom. Known the company for quite a long period of time, and Ameren used to be a premium regulated utility with one of the highest P\/E multiples in the sector 20 years back. And I really appreciate you going through the strategy and returning it to its roots. And I would just hope the process is quick and fast because you deserve to be back to a premium regulated utility. And I just wanted to thank you.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you. Thank you for your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, kind of following up on some of the GENCO discussion here, given the potential to sell the assets here, how do you think about some of the eventual tax benefits kind of akin to some of your other neighboring peers, they've discussed? Is there some kind of NOL benefit here we could be looking at?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, Julian, I can't comment on -- akin to our neighbors. But yes, I think that there has been -- some have written about. I think some have tried to take a look at, say, the deferred taxes overall at Ameren and then subtract out the regulated utility balances. And I would just caution that, I think, when you do that, you end up with, I'd say, too large of a number. There are certain deferred tax balances up at the Ameren corp level related to Ameren-specific things like employee benefit plans, whether they'd be deferred comp or share plans, as well as deferred taxes on NOLs and tax credit carryforwards and things like that. There are also -- in terms of -- if you start thinking about an exit of the business, there are also certain deferred intercompany gains that would be triggered as a result of the historical transfer of these assets out of the utilities. So there are a number of things that I would say make it difficult to get one's arms around what a potential tax loss would be associated with an exit of the business. The other thing, Julien, is I think the -- as you go through time, that tax basis and the assets change. So depending upon the timing of an exit, the form of an exit, whether it be sale of the assets, sale of the equity or restructuring, all of those things could result in different tax answers in terms of the potential tax loss. So we're certainly hesitant to try to put a precise value on that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Another quick GENCO follow-up here. Noticed recently, PJM's website seems to suggest that you've been successful in transacting on power and capacity. I'd be curious, just to get a holistic sense, how much are you able to transact into PJM off of your portfolio?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. So, Julien, with respect to the merchant segment, they have about 117 megawatts of approved transmission from MISO into PJM for the planning years, 2012, 2013 and beyond. They've also been able to get an additional 530 megawatts of approved transmission from MISO into PJM starting in 2015. And so that's been approved, and there are also some other requests in the queue. But that's what's been approved at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So when we're thinking about modeling GENCO for the 2015, '16 auction year, we should expect you to be able to clear at least in some of these incrementals? Is that the way to think about it?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. That would be -- think about it, although you used the term GENCO. And I don't have the breakdown, but I think this -- I'm pretty sure that this transmission is unit-specific. And so some of it relates to AERG, and some of it relates to GENCO.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Fantastic. And just a quick, quick follow-up on the put option. Under what scenarios -- if you can refresh our memories, when would you execute it? How do you think about executing it, just given the developments?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. So the execution of -- or the put option is really a GENCO decision, a GENCO board management decision. The put option expires March 31 of 2014. As we said on the call, we do not expect that Ameren and AERG would extend that put option beyond its current date, but it does go through the end of March of 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask on the regulated side of the house. Just -- can you talk a little bit about transmission investment, both at Ameren Illinois and at ATXI, just in terms of which one might be more front-end loaded, which one might be more back-end loaded? If I look just at Slide 20, your transmission CapEx roughly -- I think it's $340 million for 2013. It almost implies that both are pretty back-end loaded, but would love your comments.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. No, Michael. I appreciate the question. On Slide 20, though, and as you look to Slide 21 in terms of the rate base growth, I think, overall, the CapEx investment at the Ameren Illinois utilities I wouldn't say is really front-end loaded but, as we've talked before, is more ratable over that 5-year period. And -- whereas the ATXI transmission investment does become more back-end loaded. So it starts a little bit slower, particularly in 2013. But by the time you get to 2014, 2015, it starts to ramp up but gets to more peak levels out in the 2016, 2017 time frame. But again, the Ameren Illinois transmission spending is expected to be more ratable over that period of time.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on Ameren Illinois, the distribution side, I want to make sure I understand. In your guidance, are you assuming you earn on a year end rate base and not the weighted average rate base? And I know that's been a little bit of a disputed point between companies there and the commission and the legislature. Just trying to make sure I understand what's in guidance versus what you think the regulation and the legislation supposes currently?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. No, Michael, it's a good observation. You're right. We have baked in the year end rate base, so we are operating with the expectation that the legislation, as we understand it, should work -- will work that way in 2013. So we have reflected in there the year end rate base.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last item on the non-regulated side. I noticed you didn't provide hedging detail.","Martin J. Lyons","I didn't provide hedging details. I mean, given our intent to exit that business, I thought that providing those disclosures with long -- basically get to longer-term earnings and cash flow drivers were less relevant and wanted to focus more on the exit. That said, Michael, all of the data that traditionally we've provided in those slides will be provided in the 10-K. So you'll certainly have access to that information.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Senchak with Decade Capital.","Scott Senchak","Just a couple of questions. Do you expect the level of the parent long-term debt to grow over the next couple of years? In other words, will you be issuing any parent long-term debt?","Martin J. Lyons","We would expect, Scott, that over -- if you look at where our investments are being made over time, really being made at the regulated utilities and therefore would expect, consistent with past practice, that those investments would be financed at those regulated utility subsidiaries.","Scott Senchak","And the parent currently does have some debt, I think. In your '13 guidance, where is that interest expense allocated?","Martin J. Lyons","In the 2013 guidance, consistent with past practice, the interest expense is allocated to the merchant and other.","Scott Senchak","Okay. Got you. And is there an overall equity ratio that we should think about going forward to keep the overall business? And I noticed you mentioned the utilities are going to be 50% to 53%. But just wondering, as we model this to find out, what should we do for the overall company?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Overall as well, we talked about over time at about that 50-50 kind of level. I think, as you probably saw in the stats that were attached to the press release, I think after the impairment charge, we stand right around 49% and we'd expect to be right around that 50-50 over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeSapri with MorningStar.","Joseph DeSapri - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the thought process or considerations around pursuing the Illinois variance at GENCO? And then soon thereafter, deciding that the business still isn't economic despite receiving a desired variance outcome, kind of what sort of changed there?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, I'm not sure that anything really changed there. When you look back at the reason for pursuing the variance, certainly, the power prices are very low. The financial situation and condition with respect to GENCO and the merchant business suggested that a variance was really needed, that financially, we're just really unable to put money forward to complete the scrubber in the near term. And of course, we've provided, I think, a proposal that was overall environmentally beneficial in putting that forward. I think what transpired is -- or what's happened is that -- is simply a continuation of the same situation, that financial -- excuse me, the power markets continued to be very difficult. We saw over the course of 2012 not only a decline in near-term power prices but also a flattening of the forward curve and -- which make the outlook for the business even more challenging. So I wouldn't really say any difference. I would say it's just both a reflection of the same difficult conditions.","Joseph DeSapri - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And a follow-up. Will those -- will that benefit of that variance allowance, could that potentially transfer to a new potential owner if the assets were sold?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. That's a variance that is -- variance was granted to Ameren Energy Resources.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","First of all, I was wondering if you could give a little more clarity regarding 2013 debt financing plans. You mentioned you don't expect any equity issuance and that you're going to have negative free cash flow. So if you could just give us a sense of -- besides the debt issuance, I know you have $350 million that matures late in the year -- but just overall?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Dan. I think -- yes, you're on the right track there, obviously. We have a $200 million maturity in Missouri in July and a $150 million maturity in Illinois later in the year in December. As we think about it -- so I think those would be likely potential candidates for refinancing. As I mentioned earlier on the call, at year end, we also -- Ameren-wide had about $200 million of cash on hand and no credit facility borrowings. As we go into next year, we do expect that we are going to have these negative free cash flows at the utility businesses. So we'll we thinking about, Dan, the $200 million maturity in July at Missouri. But we'll be taking a look at what cash they have on hand, as well as what happens between now and July in terms of capital expenditures and free cash flows and then making the determination about the timing and the size of a debt offering with respect to Missouri. And similar, in Illinois, we are investing in Illinois, both in the distribution business, as well as in the transmission infrastructure, expecting to have negative free cash flows there. And again, we'll be taking a look at that, as well as in conjunction with that $150 million maturity, and assessing again the timing and size of a debt offering there. But you're on the right track in thinking about those maturities coupled with the negative free cash flows associated with those businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terran Miller with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Terran Miller","Just in terms of the generation business, I know you said that the timing is uncertain. But would you be disappointed if we got to year end 2013 and this had not been resolved?","Martin J. Lyons","Terran, this is Marty. No, I wouldn't say disappointed if we got to the end of 2013 and it wasn't resolved. I think -- as I said before, we're going to do what we believe is in the greatest overall benefit for Ameren, and we're certainly looking to approach this exit in whatever form it takes in an orderly fashion.","Terran Miller","Okay. And just a follow-up on the variance question. The variance was granted to, I believe, Ameren Energy Resources. If that portfolio is split, what happens to the benefits and the variances, i.e., if Gen files or is -- if it has to go to one buyer and the other assets go to another.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Terran. I know it's a legal question that I guess I'm not really prepared to speak to at the moment. I'm not sure whether each entity would individually need to comply with the emissions limitations of the variance, or whether there'd be a requirement to go back to the Pollution Control Board. So I wouldn't want to speculate at this point on how that might have to be handled.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phillip Pennell with Mariner Investment Group.","Phillip Pennell","Just a quick one, going back to the interconnect question with regard to PJM and MISO. I know that there is some going back and forth right now between the 2 ISOs, and I was wondering -- you have any comments in terms of how you expect that to work out? And obviously, with -- I believe it's Elgin as the only plant that's got any capacity payments that it's receiving now through PJM, and you mentioned that it was going up to like 500 megawatts or whatever in 2015. Are the other gas plants that are currently in the area going to receive any of that as potential capacity payments?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Let me see if I can expand a little bit. First of all, Elgin is actually in PJM and so it is receiving capacity payments. But that would be in addition to what I noted earlier on the call, the 117 megawatts of approved transmission from MISO into PJM for 2012, 2013 is incremental to Elgin, as is the $530 million of approved transmission starting in 2015. And again, I believe that, that transmission that's been approved from MISO into PJM is power plant unit specific. And I don't recall whether the other gas-fired units actually would benefit from that transmission, those transmission paths. The megawatt of -- the megawatts I just talked about in terms of approved transmission is really obtained through sort of normal processes of working with PJM to get that transmission into -- from MISO into PJM. So it's sort of just part of normal processes that we've been working through. In terms of the broader discussions between PJM and MISO, we're certainly hopeful that we can get to a point where we have more complete capacity portability between MISO and PJM and -- but when and how those discussions may come to that end is difficult to predict. We're certainly hopeful that the conversations will be fruitful and substantial progress can be made in 2013.","Phillip Pennell","Okay. I mean, obviously, what PJM came back with last was not constructive. But I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Finally, you mentioned that moving forward with the unregulated business spin off or restructuring or whatever happens would be done within the context of your legal responsibilities. What are you referring to with regard to your legal responsibilities?","Martin J. Lyons","Certainly, as we think about the exit from the merchant business, we're certainly mindful of not only our fiduciary duties to the Ameren shareholders but also obligations that we have to the noteholders at GENCO. And that's what we meant by that.","Douglas Fischer","All right. With that, I think we're going to end since our time has expired. This is Doug Fischer. Thank you for participating in this call.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and an update on financial and regulatory matters, including 2016 earnings considerations. We will then open the call for questions.","Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today\u2019s presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner who will start on Page 5 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced solid third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share in the prior period. The earnings advance reflected higher retail electric sales volumes resulting from warmer summer temperatures that were near normal for the quarter. The warmer weather raised earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share compared with 2014.","Consistent with our strategic plan, year-over-year earnings comparisons are also benefiting from the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers. These investments continue to be weighted toward our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses that operate under framework supportive of infrastructure investment. Further, the seasonal rate redesign and variances in the timing of revenue recognition and the formula ratemaking for our Illinois electric delivery business positively affected the comparisons for the quarter, as did a lower effective income tax rate. These positive variances were offset in part by lower recognized allowed ROEs for our electric transmission and delivery businesses, regulated by the FERC and ICC.","I am also pleased to report that our core earnings were $2.44 per share for the first nine months of 2015, which reflects a strong increase from $2.21 per share for the year ago period. These results exclude certain items we discussed with you during our second quarter conference call. Based on these solid results, today, we also narrowed our 2015 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the upper half of our prior core earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.","Turning now to Page 6, here we reiterate our strategic plan. Simply put, the execution of this strategy delivered the solid results I just reported to you and I strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. Overall, I am very pleased with our team\u2019s performance through September as we continue to deliver solid value to our customers across all of our businesses. In particular, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks to enhance good reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage, among other things.","As you can see, we invested $886 million or about two-thirds of our $1.3 billion of year-to-date capital expenditures in jurisdictions with these modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. This was a 17% increase over the amount invested in these jurisdictions during the same period last year. Approximately $475 million was invested in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including the ongoing construction of ATXI\u2019s $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction is well along on the first of nine line segments of this project with wires being strung across all 132 erected pole structures. Further, foundation work is underway on three additional line segments as is construction of all 10 substations.","In addition, I am pleased to note that in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity with approximately $150 million Spoon River project. We are now proceeding with right-of-way acquisition and line construction in this project is expected to begin late next year. We also have a request pending at the Missouri Public Service Commission for certificate of public convenience and necessity for the approximately $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeastern Missouri and we expect the decision early next year. All three of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved multi-value projects.","Regarding the cases pending at the FERC challenging MISOs based allowed ROE of 12.38% for electric transmission services, we expect the FERC administrative law judge to issue an initial decision in the first of two complaint cases later this month. However, the final FERC orders are not expected until 2016 in the first case and 2017 in the second case. We continue to advocate for an ROE level that is fair and one that will incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation.","Turning to Page 7 of my presentation, let me provide an update on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. Here, we invested approximately $410 million in electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first nine months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois\u2019 Modernization Action Plan. This work, enabled by the state\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, continues to provide significant value to our customers and the state of Illinois. Notably, our work remains on track to meet or exceed the investment, reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals of the act. We have also been focused on achieving positive resolutions of our pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate update proceeding and natural gas delivery rate case.","Earlier this week, we received a constructive proposed order from the administrative law judges in our natural gas delivery case. In a few weeks, we expect an order from the ALJ in our electric delivery case, where the differences between the parties have been narrowed to $4 million or less. At the end of the day, based on the progress to-date between the parties and both of these cases, we are optimistic that we will receive constructive decisions from the ICC in December.","Moving to Missouri electric service, here the regulatory framework is not as constructive as those of FERC or Illinois. Nonetheless, it is our goal to earn at or close to our allowed rate of return in all our jurisdictions. Of course, this objective is more challenging in Missouri given the use of a historical test year and a lengthy regulatory approval process, among other things. As we have done in the past, we are working hard to mitigate this lag by leveraging ongoing, enterprise-wide lean continuous improvement efforts while aggressively pursuing cost reductions throughout our operating and support organizations. And when necessary, we will seek adjustments to our Missouri rates to address regulatory lag and to earn a fair return on the investments we are making for the benefit of our customers.","One area where Missouri had historically been a leader in terms of a constructive framework was in energy efficiency. Since 2013, Ameren Missouri has been executing on a comprehensive 3-year energy efficiency plan under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act or MEIA. The MEIA has provided electric utilities with the appropriate incentives to make investments in energy efficiency for the benefit of our customers. I am pleased to say that Ameren Missouri\u2019s first 3-year plan has been even more successful than we anticipated which has resulted in substantial benefits for our customers.","Earlier this year, we had a filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which started to extend these energy efficiency programs for another 3 years, utilizing a similar structure as well as incorporating best practices learned from our first program. Unfortunately last month, the Missouri commission issued an order rejecting our proposed plan. This is disappointing because we believe our proposal provided clear benefits to customers while balancing the interest of shareholders. Under MEIA, proposing an energy efficiency plan is voluntary and we are evaluating our next steps.","Finally I should note, we continue our relentless advocacy efforts with Missouri\u2019s policymakers and key stakeholders to enhance the existing regulatory framework to address regulatory lag and support investment. While we continue to be appropriate investments in Missouri to ensure safe and adequate service, Missouri is falling behind other states in modernizing its energy policies and energy infrastructure. That is why we continued to relentlessly advocate for better policies to support investment in Missouri. Our message to Missouri policymakers and stakeholders remains simple and straightforward. Modernizing the state\u2019s regulatory framework is essential to support needed investments to upgrade aging electric utility infrastructure in a timely manner and to create jobs.","We continue to communicate that such modernization will yield benefits similar to those at the state of Illinois and many other states around the country are realizing today and is clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the economic vitality of Missouri as a whole. And while no final decisions have been made, we continue to look very closely at potential legislative solutions to address this matter during the upcoming 2016 legislative session.","Turning now to Page 8 and our long-term growth outlook, in February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital to FERC-regulated electric transmission in Illinois Electric and natural gas delivery services because these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investment benefits to all of our customers.","To that end on our second quarter call, we noted that we have identified $500 million to $1 billion of potential investments in our Illinois transmission and electric and gas delivery businesses, which will be incremental to those included in the 2014 through 2019 rate base growth plan we outlined in February and illustrated on this page. We are evaluating these incremental investments as part of our normal annual planning process. These incremental Illinois investments would be directed to the monetization, reconstruction and replacement of aging electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure such as transmission and distribution lines, breakers, transformers and underground network facilities. It would sustain and improve reliability for our customers and would primarily occur after 2016. We will provide an update on our year end call in February when we roll forward our long-term investment outlook.","Turning now to Page 9, in addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2019. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and natural gas delivery systems in the state. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects, which maintain and enhance reliability in our service territory, including projects to meet NERC requirements. In addition, our transmission development team continues to pursue FERC-regulated regional electric transmission projects focusing on projects in MISO, the PJM Interconnection and the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, we expect to pursue local and regional transmission opportunities to connect renewable energy sources and natural gas fired generation expected to be built to comply with the Clean Power Plan.","Turning to Page 10, in Missouri we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. These include the installation of advanced meters and replacement of aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also expect that our plan for complying with the Clean Power Plan will provide incremental investment opportunities, including those in renewable energy sources and natural gas fired generation. The impact of the final Clean Power Plan on our operations, infrastructure investment plans and customers rates in Missouri and Illinois will be driven by those states implementation plans, which may not be finalized until 2018. While this rule will face legal challenges, we are committed to working constructively with state agencies, energy providers and other stakeholders in each state to develop implementation plans that provide customers with electric service that is reliable and reasonably priced. And as we have stated previously, we expect any compliance investments to be recovered in rates. The bottom line is that we believe that the investment opportunities I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders.","Turning now to Page 11, I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.425 per share, reflecting confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings plans. This is a 3.7% increase from the prior quarter\u2019s dividend, resulting in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.70 per share. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","Turning now to Page 12, let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking. In addition, our shares provide a current yield of about 3.9%, which is also superior to the average of our peers. We believe this earnings growth outlook and dividend provide a very attractive total return potential for investors.","We are committed to executing the strategy I have just discussed with you today and we believe that we will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call. Now, I will now turn the call over to Marty to cover some of the matters I discussed in greater detail.","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation, today we reported third quarter 2015 earnings of $1.41 per share compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the prior year period. There were no adjustments to GAAP earnings for these third quarter periods. Moving to Page 15, here we highlight factors that drove the $0.21 per share increase in third quarter 2015 results. Key factors included higher retail electric sales volumes, driven by warmer summer temperatures, which increased earnings by an estimated $0.09 per share. Third quarter 2015 temperatures were near normal compared with the cooler than normal summer temperatures experienced in the prior year period. So for the year-to-date period, weather remains an estimated $0.05 favorable compared to normal, primarily driven by the colder winter temperatures.","Before I leave the subject of electric sales volumes, I would like to briefly report on these for the year-to-date period. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers increased by approximately three quarters of 1%, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased by approximately three quarter of 1%. The increase in Illinois sales volumes all users by the commercial sector while the decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri\u2019s current energy efficiency plan compensates for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from the plant\u2019s programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by 0.25%.","For the first nine months of 2015, kilowatt hour sales to Illinois\u2019 and Missouri\u2019s industrial customers decreased about 1% and 1.5% and about 4%, respectively, reflecting lower sales to a large, low margin Illinois agricultural customer and lower sales to our largest Missouri customer, Noranda Aluminum, due to a reduction in consumption at its aluminum smelter.","Moving back then to a discussion of the quarter\u2019s results. The third quarter earnings comparison was also positively affected by increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure using formulaic ratemaking, which increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year ago quarter. In addition, the third quarter earnings comparison benefited by $0.06 per share due to a seasonal rate redesign and the timing of revenue recognition under formula ratemaking, each related to Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric delivery service. Year-to-date, these two timing-related items had a $0.02 per share net favorable impact on results and we continue to expect they will have no net effect on the full year 2015 earnings. Finally, third quarter earnings benefited by $0.02 per share from a lower effective income tax rate.","Moving to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the third quarter earnings comparison, the contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois were reduced by a total of $0.03 per share because of lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, since the fourth quarter of last year, our transmission earnings have been reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC.","Regarding third quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.67% allowed ROE compared with 9.25% in the year ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.45% to 2.87%. Of course, fully year 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate.","Turning now to Page 16, first, as Warner highlighted, we now expect our 2015 core earnings to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is at the high end of our previous guidance range. On this page, we list select items for you to consider as you update your earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. I will comment on a few of these items. First, let me remind you that last year, we earned $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter. Of course, we had a Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage in the fourth quarter of last year. The absence of the Callaway refueling outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with that year ago period. Second, over the balance of this year, we also expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.","Moving to factors that are anticipated to negatively affect the fourth quarter 2015 earnings comparison, these include a higher effective tax rate, reflecting an unusually low rate in the year ago period. This is expected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. In addition, the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption costs will reduce earnings by $0.03 per share.","Before we leave our discussion of this year, I would like to mention that we now expect to issue long-term debt at the Ameren parent company and Ameren Illinois during the fourth quarter to repay a substantial portion of their short-term debt. We believe now is a prudent time to reduce short-term borrowings. We have been making primarily to help fund our capital investments, including our investments in FERC-regulated transmission.","Turning to Page 17, I will now update you on select pending regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, our annual Illinois electric delivery formula rate update filing is pending at the ICC. This filing supports an increase in 2016 electric delivery service rates of $109 million. The ICC staff supports an annual increase of $107 million and other parties are recommending a $105 million increase. An ICC administrative law judge recommendation in this case is expected next week with an ICC final decision in December and new rates effective in January.","Moving then to Page 18, we also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois, in which we have requested a $45 million annual rate increase based on a future test year ending in December 2016. Earlier this week, the ICC administrative law judges hearing the case recommended a rate increase amount that was consistent with our request based on a future test year and incorporating a 9.6% ROE, up from the current 9.08% ROE. The ALJs also recommended approval of our request for a volume balancing adjustment for residential and small commercial customers. This would ensure that changes in natural gas sales volumes did not result in the over or under-collection of revenues from these classes. We expect the ICC to issue a decision in December, with new rates effective in January.","Turning now to Page 19, as previously mentioned, there are two complaint cases pending at the FERC seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The anticipated schedules for these cases are outlined on this page.","Moving now to Page 20, we plan to provide 2016 earnings guidance and update our longer term rate base and earnings growth outlook when we release fourth quarter 2015 earnings in February. However, here we list select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. I will highlight some of the more noteworthy ones. Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit under forward-looking formula ratemaking from higher rate base from investments and projects at Ameren Illinois and ATXI. For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, we also anticipate increased earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, again reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be of course the average 2016 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, we expect new rates to be in effect in order to reflect rate base levels and increased cost contained in our 2016 forward test year rate case filing.","Moving to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery service earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share of 2015 earnings related to an ICC order approving the recovery of power usage costs. For Missouri, the 2016 earnings comparison is expected to be negatively affected by about $0.09 per share for the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016 as again there is no refueling outage in 2015. In addition, we expect increases in depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses.","Next, as Warner noted, the Missouri Commission recently rejected a new proposed three-year energy efficiency plan, which would have begun in January 2016. We are studying the order and evaluating whether to file another proposed plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Regardless, we do expect to see continuing reduced load from Amren Missouri\u2019s highly successful 2013 to 2015 EMEA energy efficiency program bleed into 2016. Given that we haven\u2019t finished the 2015 program year, it\u2019s premature to estimate what the carryover impact of the current programs will be on 2016. We will provide an update on our sales expectations in February. A portion of the impact of this load reduction will be offset by a performance incentive expected to be recognized in 2016 from the 2013 to 2018 program subject to commission approval.","Finally, for Missouri, we expect 2016 earnings will benefit from a decline in operations and maintenance expenses, not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, excluding, of course, Callaway refueling outage expenses. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management actions and is consistent with our ongoing efforts to align our spending with the Missouri regulatory framework and decisions as well as economic conditions.","Finally, turning to Page 21, I will summarize our comments this morning. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We have delivered strong earnings year-to-date and expect our 2015 core earnings per share to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share at the high end of our previous guidance range. In addition, we have a superior, long-term earnings growth outlook, driven by an above peer group average rate base growth plan that is focused on utility infrastructure investments in jurisdictions with modern, constructive ratemaking.","In addition and as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we expect to finance our growth through 2019 without the need for equity. When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren\u2019s recently increased dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.9%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line Julien Dumoulin Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Warner Baxter","We can Julien. Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Excellent. Well, congratulations on the results. I wanted to first ask you on parent debt issuances, can you elaborate given the upcoming issuance, how much you are thinking and how you think about general targets there?","Warner Baxter","Good question, Julien. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics in terms of the amount at this point. But if you take a look at the balance sheet, we have about $783 million I believe, of short-term debt that\u2019s outstanding. And as you look through the K, you will see \u2013 or Q you will see that, that balance really resides up at the parent and its money that we have been borrowing on a short-term basis to fund these long-term investments we are making in transmission assets. So we feel now it\u2019s a good time. As we said on the call, expect to refinance a substantial portion of that with long-term debt. But I don\u2019t want to get into specifics on amount here yet.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Alright, great. And then secondly, you have talked a lot about transmission, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts following the Wood River announcement yesterday and potential for Clinton retirements, what does that mean for transmission? And perhaps more broadly, how do you think about the transmission CapEx budgets in light of MISO planning and also should you get an ROE reduction, how does that drive your thinking into this 4Q update on transmission?","Warner Baxter","Well, Julien, this is Warner. A lot of questions in there, so I think that to kick that off, we will let Maureen Borkowski, who is the President of our transmission operations give you sort of a general sense on some of your initial questions.","Maureen Borkowski","Hi Julien. Thanks for the questions. First of all, with regard to either Wood River or Clinton, which Clinton has not, at this point in time definitively said anything. We work with MISO to define what additional transmission investment is needed to maintain the system reliably. And then we would move out on developing any projects or making any upgrades that were necessary. I would point out that any of those would be reliability investments and therefore would not be subject to FERC Order 1000, but we would make those investments ourselves. I am not sure about the rest of your questions. Could you kind of repeat what else you were asking?","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Yes. I mean I was just thinking more broadly, where do we stand on the MISO planning process in light of say PPP and then just in light of getting the FERC Order 1000 processes going, how do you think about the transmission budget. And then perhaps also a related question would be, if you do get an ROE reduction, does that negatively impact your CapEx budget?","Maureen Borkowski","So this is Maureen again. With regard to the Clean Power Plan and with regard to FERC Order 1000, we don\u2019t currently have anything reflected in our current CapEx to address either of those issues. We do believe that the MISO may be having a very small FERC Order 1000 project approved this year, which would then go out with an RFP next year. And with regard to the Clean Power Plan, MISO is actively working on developing a transmission expansion plan to address what they believe would be some of the impacts of the state plans. Again, we would expect to see more of that later next year or even into 2017. With regard to the ROE, all I can say is we still firmly believe that FERC understands the need for continued transmission development and they also understand that the ROE that they set does impact the capital allocation of utilities. And if they want that investment to continue, they need to keep the ROE healthy.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Alright, excellent. Thank you, guys for the time.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning Paul.","Paul Patterson","With respect to the legislative outlook, can you give us a flavor as to what may have changed there that might make you feel more optimistic about something happening, if anything has changed. And just give us a bit of a flavor for what we might be seeing in the spring?","Warner Baxter","Paul, this is Warner. I will comment and then Michael Moehn, if he has any additional comments, I will ask him to join. But in terms of what\u2019s different, I think there are a couple of things just to be mindful of. None of these things ultimately guarantee success, but there are some differences. I think number one, as we said before, we have seen very clearly the constructive outcomes that are resulting from the changes in the Illinois framework, constructive outcomes, which are benefiting customers and clearly benefiting the entire state of Illinois and so it isn\u2019t just one year. We are seeing several years of those constructive outcomes and those are certainly notable. I think the second thing to be mindful of is that earlier this year, the Governor issued his comprehensive energy plan that included a host of things. But also incorporated in there was the recognition for the need to modernize the framework to support investment. So I think that too is something that will be I am sure a subject of discussion during the upcoming session. Certainly, I think when you look around at the nation and as you follow, I think it\u2019s becoming clear as part of our conversations with key stakeholders across the state that Missouri is lagging behind in terms of their framework, their policies and their investment. So you put all those things together. I think those two are differences. Coupled with the fact that we do have new leaders, both in the House and the Senate and we look forward to working very closely with those new leaders, not just next year, but in the years ahead. So all those things I think are certainly, you asked for what were some of the differences, those are just some of the highlights, I would point out there. In terms of solutions look, the bottom line is that there are a lot of solutions that have been \u2013 that are out there that we have talked about in the past. But also ones that are being used, utilized across the country. So I think these are things that we look at, but more importantly we discuss with stakeholders because whether there is any legislative initiative that goes forward, it will be informed by those conversations with the key stakeholders across the state. So Michael, I will ask you if there is anything else to add.","Michael Moehn","Well said, Warner. I mean I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to overstate the importance of the comprehensive state energy plan, but really it was a thoughtful document, it was a collaborative process, really brought together through both utilities as well as environmental groups and others. And there are a number of recommendations in there about modernizing the electric infrastructure, enacting legislation that provides for accelerated grid monetization, performing Missouri\u2019s utility ratemaking process. And so there really is a framework, I think to bring forth these discussions with a number of interested parties and trying to see that happen because there is a number of things in there they would like to get done as well. And so I think it really does provide a catalyst to try to put something forward.","Paul Patterson","I did notice it as well. But I guess what I am wondering is I mean, outside of an actual legislative change, what should we think would be the timing for the next Missouri rate case?","Warner Baxter","I would say Paul, this is Warner again. Look I think as we discussed during our last call, there have been no decisions on the next Missouri rate case. And as we have said in our talking points, we will be mindful of regulatory lag and the need to file a rate case to make sure that we earn a fair return on those investments. So, no decision has been made, but we have to file a rate case within four years. And so generally speaking, that takes you \u2013 if that\u2019s under the fuel adjustment cost provisions. And so that takes you out sometime until 2018 where we would have to file, but up until then, it is one of those things that we continue to study.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then on energy efficiency, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the rejection of your plan and you mentioned you were thinking about perhaps re-filing it? Just anymore you could tell us about that?","Michael Moehn","Yes, sure. This is Michael Moehn. I think it was unfortunate that we thought we were addressing the Commission\u2019s concerns. We had a number of parties that had actually signed on supporting our plan, but I was making down to a couple of things. It was really the Commission desire to apply and utilize an after the fact evaluation in measurement and verification process that really prevented us from recording the revenues associated with those lost sales. And there was also \u2013 they are very focused on reducing demand and our programs are really designed on reducing energy. And so those are couple of things that we just \u2013 we have to go back and think about it and see if there is a solution forward. These are important programs. They really have worked well. I think everybody has benefited from them, shareholders, customers. And so we would love to see them come back and so we are trying to be very thoughtful about that process and think about what the next steps would be here in the very near future.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But sales growth after 2016, I mean, you mentioned that there is a lag effect in terms of, you still expected to impact usage in 2016, but we should expect \u2013 what do you think the impact in 2017 if there is no new plan to replace it? How should we think about your projections for sales growth in 2017 and beyond?","Warner Baxter","Paul, this is back to Marty again. Yes, we did talk about in the call that we expected to have some bleed over into 2016. And largely I think that will be a function of how 2015 programs wrap up. So, it\u2019s premature to really talk about how much that maybe in \u201816. But we wouldn\u2019t expect meaningful impacts from sales from the current programs beyond 2016. In fact, never really even when we did envision additional energy efficiency programs going forward, never really expected a meaningful effect on earnings when you look out to, say like a 2018 time period. So, short answer to your question, expect an impact from \u201816, expect that to be diminished as we get into \u201817 and again never expected really a meaningful impact overall in 2018. One thing why you are on that energy efficiency, Paul, but I do want to clarify, I am told that earlier in the call, I talked about the performance incentive we would receive in \u201816 and I may have misspoken and said that related to the 2013 to 2018 period. What I meant to say is it relates to the 2013 to 2015 program that we will be wrapping up later this year.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Warner Baxter","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","One of the big drivers in the quarter you said was some rate design timing issues. Kind of, I guess, what quarters did you borrow that from to make this quarter strong and will have a fourth quarter impact? ","Marty Lyons","I get your question. This is Marty again. So yes, we did have a seasonal rate redesign that did affect the timing of margins and earnings recognitions for the year. I mentioned that it was a $0.06 positive in the quarter. However, it\u2019s mostly, I will call it repayment from prior periods. So, on a year-to-date basis \u2013 on a year-to-date basis, it\u2019s a positive $0.02. And then we expect that $0.02 to go away through the fourth quarter. So, that by the end of the year, it\u2019s flat with no net impact on net margins or earnings.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you. That helps. And then what was weather like in the fourth quarter of \u201814 relative to normal?","Warner Baxter","I think we have got that. If you look on Slide 16, where we give our fourth quarter earnings guidance, you will see down at the very bottom that we expected to be a slight negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter by negative $0.01. So, we had about a $0.01 of positive weather last year and expect \u2013 you got it.","Paul Ridzon","And then when you issue \u2013 it sounds like you are going to issue most of the long-term debt to pay down short-term at parent and less so in Illinois?","Marty Lyons","Didn\u2019t really comment on that. What we said was that we plan to do long-term debt issuance at both the Ameren parent company level at this point as well as at Ameren Illinois here in the fourth quarter.","Paul Ridzon","And that would get picked up in your next formulaic rate resetting?","Marty Lyons","That is correct. The cost of long-term debt whatever that maybe at Ameren Illinois, would get picked up in the next regulatory filing.","Paul Ridzon","And when is that filing?","Marty Lyons","I think that filing would be next spring, April or May of next spring.","Paul Ridzon","There might be a little bit of lag there in higher debt cost?","Marty Lyons","Well, the way it works again, formulaically is we will true up our revenues this year based upon our actual cost of service this year, our year end rate base. And so we will factor that into whatever true-up that we do reflect. And then the filing we would make next April with the Commission would be to seek recovery of any differential or a refund to customers if that was appropriate. But again, the whole program is designed that there would be no lag. The revenues we reflect in each year are a function of that year\u2019s cost and that year\u2019s rate base and cost of capital. So, there is really no lag in Illinois in terms of an earnings perspective.","Paul Ridzon","So it will get picked up in the true up?","Marty Lyons","Yes.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. The way that the energy efficiency program worked, were you getting an incentive for performance that was on a one-year lag or is the \u2013 so you would get sort of \u201814 and \u201813, \u201815 and \u201814, etcetera or you are getting \u2013 is this a payment that you are getting for the cumulative impact of the program and so what happens sort of once every several years?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Greg. This is Marty. So, the incentive that we expect to recognize in 2016 is really for that full period, 2013, 2014 and 2015.","Greg Gordon","Got it. So, if I think about the moving parts here, we can talk more about this on Monday when we see you at EI. There will be some offset to top line revenue from the incentive payment. Is that \u2013 are those the only two moving parts to this or is there something else that gets into the mix in terms of understanding the net impact of the energy efficiency program or is it just those two pieces?","Marty Lyons","Well, as you look into 2016, that is correct. Those would be the two moving pieces, absent the new energy efficiency program put in place, there would be the bleed over impact into 2016 if the prior year\u2019s programs partially offset by the expectation of these incentive payments.","Greg Gordon","Okay.","Marty Lyons","As you look into 2016, those are the moving parts. If you look back historically, it\u2019s been a function of not only the reduction in sales, but the net shared benefits that we have received that once the 3-year program ends those go away. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 as you look into 2016, you do have the two components.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So, what was this next year benefits component and was that on a calculated on sort of contemporaneous year basis or was that calculated on a lag?","Marty Lyons","It was calculated on a \u2013 I guess a contemporaneous year basis, not exactly sure what you mean by that, but basically...","Greg Gordon","Meaning that \u2013 saying that the calculation of the benefit happened in the same year as the calculation of the savings.","Marty Lyons","Yes. So, it was actually calculated based upon the programs and what incentives were actually provided to the customers and the expected benefits that were to be received from the customers over as a result of those programs. So, I think it was contemporaneous. What you do is you provide the customer an incentive. There would be an expected benefit there in terms of energy use savings and then a percentage of that was reflected in that year in terms of net shared benefits. And as we have shown in the slides, it was basically a present value of the expected benefits to be received from the customer from those programs offered in that year.","Greg Gordon","Okay, I get it. So in \u201816 over \u201815, you won\u2019t be getting \u2013 you won\u2019t be \u2013 you won\u2019t have any programs, so you won\u2019t be getting that revenue. There will be a bleed over effect of the impact of the prior year\u2019s programs, but then you will get the bonus, which happens every several years and then we move on from there?","Marty Lyons","You got it.","Greg Gordon","Thank you. I will see you in a few days.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hi guys. Quick one here, you mentioned the positive impacts of lower O&M next year, how material was that, how are we \u2013 how should we think about that relative to the slight year-over-year headwind due to the having a Callaway outage, like which one is bigger or smaller, do they offset, etcetera?","Marty Lyons","Michael obviously, we are not giving guidance today. We wanted to give you some of the overall moving pieces. So I don\u2019t think I really want to get into quantifying the overall magnitude. We continue to work hard as we said on the call to leverage our continuous improvement efforts to be disciplined in our management of cost, be disciplined in our management of our capital and we are continuing to do those things. But I think premature at this point to really get into quantifying the pluses and minuses on 2016.","Michael Lapides","Where do you see is the biggest opportunities to realize cost savings?","Marty Lyons","Michael Moehn will again jump in on that one.","Michael Moehn","Hi Michael, it is Michael Moehn. I think it\u2019s \u2013 as we think about the program, we have had conversations about this in the past that it really is across the entire business. I mean I think that it\u2019s anywhere from generation to the distribution side, to the overhead as well. And so we are probably 3 years, 2.5 years into this 5-year program. We are making great progress. I mean it\u2019s really based on two things; workforce productivity and deploying technology to drive efficiency. There are obviously bigger areas based on where some of the spend is within energy delivery and some of the power plants, but it is equally being deployed throughout the organization.","Warner Baxter","So Michael, I would just add, this is Warner that two things. We talk a lot about Missouri, but as Michael said it isn\u2019t just in Missouri, it\u2019s across our entire organization, which includes our business and corporate services. But I will tell you, we have a disciplined approach across all of our businesses, both in Illinois as well as in transmission. So this is something we work together as a team and something that we will continue to work out together as a team going forward.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.","Warner Baxter","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill","Yes. Thank you. How much have you reserved year-to-date for the transmission ROE and is that just at ATXI?","Marty Lyons","Gregg, this is Marty. I think we will \u2013 definitely, when we file our Q, which we expect to do later today, we will have that number. I believe the number is about $36 million. But check the Q for to be sure. And really that\u2019s been reflected both at ATXI as well as in Amren Illinois, so it\u2019s basically proportionate to the rate base that we have got in those two jurisdictions.","Gregg Orrill","And that will be pretax?","Marty Lyons","Legal entities, I should say.","Gregg Orrill","That\u2019s pretax, I assume?","Marty Lyons","Yes.","Gregg Orrill","Okay, thank you.","Marty Lyons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Paz with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","David Paz","Hi, good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning.","David Paz","Can you quantify the potential investments associated with the NERC requirements ballpark?","Warner Baxter","David, I don\u2019t think we can. I mean I think that in terms of exactly what those are we have certainly given, as you well know our planned rate base growth for 2019 that\u2019s got transmission investments in there. Some of those are for NERC projects, especially those that are within Ameren Illinois. We don\u2019t call them out separately. There are certainly NERC-related projects happening in Missouri as well. And then also, as we have mentioned, that while we got there 6% rate base growth out through 2019, it doesn\u2019t yet \u2013 hasn\u2019t yet been updated to reflect any of the $500 million to $1 billion of incremental projects that we are evaluating. As you know, it\u2019s a third, a third, a third between Illinois distribution, electric distribution, gas distribution and FERC regulated transmission portion of those monies too could go to towards NERC reliability projects. But David, I can\u2019t really break out within the current disclosed program over the $500 million to $1 billion specifically how much is NERC-related.","David Paz","Okay. But so when you talk about the potential investments from those, it\u2019s really embedded in that $500 million to $1 billion or already other aspects of your plan?","Warner Baxter","Right, David.","David Paz","Okay. And then on your consolidated \u2013 looking out the consolidated balance sheet, what is your target equity ratio and where did you end the quarter?","Marty Lyons","Yes. So if you actually look at the last page of our attachments to our press release, you will see a stats page and we are right around 50-50 debt and equity at the end of the quarter. And over time, that\u2019s approximately where we want to be from a debt to equity perspective.","David Paz","Got it. Okay. And just on customer growth, have you provided what you are seeing in terms of the level of growth, particularly in Missouri, not sales growth but customer growth?","Marty Lyons","No, we didn\u2019t comment on that earlier. In Missouri, this year, year-to-date, we have seen some growth, but it\u2019s been modest. I think the residential customer accounts up about 0.3%, commercial customer account up about 0.7%. The industrial customer account unfortunately is down about 0.8%. But we have been seeing a little bit of growth in the residential and commercial areas in Missouri.","David Paz","Okay, great. Thank you.","Marty Lyons","Very good.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Fischer, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to you for any final concluding remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating in this call.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of second quarter 2013 financial results, other financial matters and pending rate cases. We will then open the call for questions.","Now here's Tom, who will start on Page 3 of the presentation.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced second quarter 2013 net income from continuing operations of $0.44 per share compared to second quarter 2012 net income from continuing operations of $0.66 per share. This reduction in earnings was a result of a planned nuclear refueling outage and an unfavorable court decision related to the Missouri fuel adjustment clause, or FAC, both in 2013, an impact of a favorable regulatory decision in 2012.","In addition, our earnings were reduced because of milder weather. The 2013 court action was a May Missouri Court of Appeals decision related to FAC treatment of certain prior-period wholesale sales. The second quarter earnings comparison was favorably impacted by new rates for Missouri Electric and Illinois Transmission Service, both effective in January 2013.","Second quarter earnings from continuing operations were in line with our expectations, excluding the charge related to the Missouri Court of Appeals' FAC decision. Reflecting our agreement to divest our merchant generation business to an affiliate of Dynegy, merchant generation results are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Marty will provide more details on our earning in a few minutes.","Moving now to Page 4. Today, we also updated earnings guidance. We now expect 2013 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share compared to the prior range of $2 to $2.20 per share. This new guidance range incorporates the second quarter 2013 charge of $0.06 per share resulting from the FAC decision just discussed, as well as cost-containment within our Missouri operations.","Guidance continues to incorporate approximately $0.20 per share of parent company and other cost, including certain costs that were previously allocated to the merchant generation business.","Turning to Page 5. We remain committed to closing a transaction to divest our merchant generation business to an affiliate of Dynegy. Once this business is divested, Ameren will be a purely rate regulated electric, natural gas and transmission company focused on growing our investments in energy infrastructure, benefiting our customers, communities and investors. We're working diligently with Dynegy to complete the transaction and continue to anticipate our fourth quarter 2013 closing.","Request for regulatory approvals are pending at the Illinois Pollution Control Board and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Last month, Dynegy's Illinois Power Holdings Units, or IPH, and our merchant generation subsidiaries requested that the Illinois Pollution Control Board grant IPH the same variance from the Illinois multipollution standard that was granted to Ameren Energy Resources in 2012. We expect the variance to be granted, and the board has until late November of this year to issue a decision.","Regarding the FERC filing for divestiture approval, last Friday, FERC requested copies of Ameren Energy Marketing's long-term wholesale contracts with 2 entities, both of which have intervened at FERC. Ameren Energy Marketing entered into these contracts under its market-based rate authority. Therefore, we now believe the contract should impede FERC's approval of the divestiture.","In addition, FERC requested that an input into Ameren's market power study be revised. Ameren and Dynegy must respond to these information requests by August 9.","In addition, our efforts to sell the 3 gas-fired energy centers we retained with the exercise of the Genco put option are progressing. We have shortlisted multiple interested potential buyers based on their initial proposals and we continue to expect to sell these plants by year end subject to separate approval by the FERC.","Moving to Page 6. We remain focused on improving the regulatory frameworks for investing in our utilities and states for the benefit of customers, communities and investors. And I'm pleased to report important recent successes on this front in the State of Illinois.","In 2011, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This act was intended to spur a decade of investment in electric delivery, reliability, improved customer service and job creation.","However, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, misapplied the act in our 2012 electric delivery formula rates. This is our view. To correct these misapplications, the Illinois General Assembly overwrote Governor Quinn's veto and enacted Senate Bill 9. The stature ensures that the originally intended provisions of the 2011 Act are applied by requiring that year end, not average rate base and capital structure be used for ratemaking.","Further, the new stature requires the use of weighted average cost of capital, not a short-term interest rate for computation of annual revenue requirement true-up deferrals. Application of SB 9's provisions is expected to have little net impact on 2013 earnings. However, we do expect these provisions to be meaningful as our infrastructure modernization investments grow in the coming years. Further, Governor Quinn signed the Natural Gas Consumer, Safety & Reliability Act in July 2013. This new law establishes a regulatory framework for accelerating gas infrastructure investment, improving customer service and creating jobs. Utilities that elect to participate may implement rate surcharges for infrastructure investments made between rate cases. Eligible gas delivery plant additions include replacement of mains and older pipe, relocation of meters, and the installation of advanced meters, among other things. These surcharges may be updated monthly. The law retains ICC oversight of utility rates and provides consumer protections, including an average annual cap on surcharges of 4% of utility rate base revenues.","Ameren Illinois expects to participate in this ratemaking program beginning in 2014 or 2015. Further, it plans to make an incremental $330 million of capital investment above a baseline of $770 million over 10 years and to create 150 new jobs at the program's peak.","Turning now to Page 7 in Missouri. We also remained committed to enhancing Missouri regulatory framework to better support investment in that state's energy infrastructure. We're focused on enhancements that would support electric utility investments that are already in place and serving customers between rate cases. We were encouraged by the substantial majorities in both the Missouri House and the Senate, that supported the Infrastructure Strengthening and Regulatory Streamlining Act, commonly referred to as electric ISRS in the 2013 session. However, the legislation was blocked late in the session by a few filibustering senators. We are evaluating options for legislation in 2014, and we'll continue to work diligently on this important matter.","As detailed on this page, Missouri electric utility regulation has improved in recent years. However, the lack of a modern framework that better supports capital investments made between rate cases limits the level of discretionary investment we can reasonably make in our energy infrastructure in this jurisdiction. An improved framework would be positive for job creation, the quality of service we can provide to our customers and the return opportunity we provide to our investors.","Before I conclude my comments on our Missouri utility, I want to mention a recent operational development. Last Friday, the Callaway Energy Center experienced a fault in its electrical equipment that transfers power from its generator to its main transformers, which provide power to the grid and to the plant. The fault tripped the plant and it also caused a small fire in the turbine building, which is located in a nonnuclear part of the facility. The fire was quickly extinguished. At no time did the situation threaten the public, and no one was injured. The plant is currently out of service and we are still in the process of assessing whether there was any major equipment damage as a result of this event. Our preliminary test to date do not indicate that we incurred any significant damage to our major equipment.","However, we still have a series of tests that we need to conduct through the weekend. Until all of our testing is completed, we are unable to provide an exact date as to when Callaway will return to service or an exact estimate of any related financial impacts of this outage.","If our complete testing confirms that no damage was sustained beyond that which has been identified to date, we estimate that the energy center will return to service in 15 to 20 days, and that the earnings impact will be less than $0.01 per share.","Moving to Page 8 of our presentation. I will conclude my business update by discussing electric transmission. Our plans to invest approximately $2.2 billion in FERC regulated electric transmission projects over the 5-year period ending in 2017 are a key part of Ameren's business strategy. These projects will benefit customers by providing more reliable and efficient electric system and it will also create jobs. Constructive forward-looking formula ratemaking that is in place for these projects provides an opportunity for us to earn fair returns on our investments, recover our costs on a timely basis.","Our single largest planned transmission investment is Ameren Transmission Companies of Illinois, Illinois Rivers project. This approximate $1.1 billion MISO approved regional multivalue project involves the construction of a new high-voltage transmission line across the state of Illinois. Our request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the approximate 400-mile transmission line is pending at the ICC.","In early July, the ICC Administrative Law Judges hearing the case issued their recommendations. We are pleased that the ALJ has agreed the project is necessary and the best approach to addressing transmission and reliability needs and the development of the competitive electricity market.","Further, we are encouraged that the ALJ has recommended that a majority of the Illinois River project, 7 of 9 segments, be granted the requested certificate. We comprehensively responded to the questions raised by the ALJs regarding the location of 2 of the 9 line segments and certain substations in our briefs on exceptions filed on July 18. Therefore, we expect a constructive decision from the ICC by August 20, and we expect this decision to allow ATXI to maintain our previously disclosed capital investment plans for the project.","Upon receipt of the certificate from the ICC, we will begin to acquire rights of way for the transmission line with a full range of construction activities expected to begin in 2014.","Closing my prepared remarks, we remained focused on delivering strong returns to our shareholders by investing in and operating our businesses in a manner consistent with our existing regulatory frameworks. This means, we will exercise disciplined capital allocation, concentrating our discretionary investments in those jurisdictions that provide modern, constructive regulatory frameworks like those at FERC and in Illinois.","Finally, we are committed to growing our earnings, earning fair returns on our investments and meeting our customers' energy needs and expectations.","I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 9 of the presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2013 net income, combining results of both continuing and discontinued operations of $0.39 per share compared to second quarter 2012 net income of $0.87 per share. The second quarter 2013 net income included a loss of $0.05 per share from discontinued operations.","As Tom previously discussed, Ameren earnings from continuing operations were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $0.66 per share for the second quarter of last year.","On Page 10, we list the key factors that drove the $0.22 per share decline in second quarter earnings from continuing operations. Several large items impacted the quarterly comparison. These include expenses related to a planned Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. Because Callaway has refueled approximately every 18 months, there was no refueling outage or associated expenses in 2012.","In addition, the second quarter 2013 earnings were reduced by $0.06 per share as a result of the Missouri Court of Appeals' decision Tom referenced earlier. This decision related to FAC treatment of certain prior period wholesale sales, which occurred in the 2009 through 2011 period. The earnings decline also reflected the absence in 2013 of a $0.07 per share 2012 benefit from a FERC order related to a disputed Missouri purchase power agreement.","Moving to sales. Temperatures negatively impacted the earnings comparison by approximately $0.05 per share. This year's early summer temperatures were cooler than last year's warmer-than-normal temperatures reducing electric sales volumes to our native load customers. Electric and gas sales volumes to native load customers also fell on a weather-normalized basis, reducing second quarter 2013 earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This primarily reflected lower weather normalized electric sales volumes in Missouri, offset by increased weather normalized electric sales in Illinois and natural gas sales in Missouri.","While on the topic of sales, I want to mention that for the full year of 2013, we expect weather normalized electric sales volumes to native load customers to be roughly flat with those of the prior year. Combined residential and commercial sales volumes are expected to increase about 0.5%, but this is expected to be offset by an expected decline in lower margin industrial sales volumes.","Focus now on the last item on Page 10. The second quarter 2013 earnings per share comparison was favorably impacted by new rates from Missouri Electric and Illinois Transmission Service, both effective in January 2013, which combined the increase in earnings by $0.08 per share.","Turning now to Page 11. Before concluding my discussion of earnings, I'd like to provide you with some information to assist your thinking about Ameren's third and fourth quarter 2013 earnings outlook.","On this page, we've listed select items that are expected to impact third and fourth quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations as compared to the impact of these items in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. First of these items is weather. In last year's third quarter, warmer-than-normal summer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.14 per share. And in the last year's fourth quarter, warmer-than-normal early winter temperatures reduced earnings by an estimated $0.02 per share.","Our 2013 guidance for earnings from continuing operations assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. The second item to note is an expected positive impact on the Ameren Illinois electric delivery earnings comparison resulting from variation in the timing and amount of expected full year recoverable cost under formula ratemaking. These earnings are expected to increase by approximately $0.10 per share in the third quarter 2013, and $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods. This is a good place to note that our full year 2013 Illinois electric delivery earnings guidance now incorporates an average 30-year treasury bond yield of approximately 3.4%, and therefore, a formula allowed return on equity of approximately 9.2%.","Finally, earnings should benefit from the new Missouri and Illinois transmission rates that went into effect in January of this year.","Turning then to Page 12. We move from earnings to a discussion of our updated 2013 cash flow guidance. We calculate free cash flow by starting with our net cash provided by operating activities, and subtracting from it our capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends and advances received for construction.","For 2013, we now anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $450 million, an improvement of $50 million from our May 2013 guidance. The guidance continues to include merchant divesture-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, including the $25 million of cash that is currently held at Genco.","These divesture-related cash outflows are more than offset by expected transaction-related cash tax benefits of approximately $180 million, in present value, to be substantially realized in 2015.","Moving to Page 13. I would like to update you on Ameren Illinois' 2 pending Illinois energy delivery rate cases. First, in January of this year, we filed a request for an increase in gas delivery rates based on a 2014 future test year.","In June, the ICC staff and other intervenors filed their initial testimony in this gas case. The primary differences between our request and the positions of the ICC staff and the Illinois Industrial Energy customers are related to the return on equity level that should be incorporated into rates. In addition, the Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board recommended that the ICC use a higher forecast of revenues from gas transportation and industrial customers than we had proposed. If adopted, this adjustment would reduce the needed rate increase. A final ICC decision is due by December 19 of this year.","Turning to Page 14. In addition to the pending gas rate case, in April of this year, we made the required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Our filing supports a net annual rate decrease consisting of a decrease for the 2012 revenue reconciliation under formula ratemaking, partially offset by an increase, primarily reflecting 2012 recoverable cost and expected 2013 net plant additions as prescribed by the rate formula.","In June, the ICC staff filed its initial testimony in the case, recommending a larger net rate decrease than we had requested. The difference between our request and the staff's recommendation is primarily attributable to the same cost of service adjustments made by the ICC in our 2012 rate orders. A final ICC decision is due by December 15 of this year, and the new rates will take effect in January of next year.","Moving finally to Page 14 of our presentation, let me summarize. Second quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations were in line with our expectations, excluding the charge related to the Missouri Court of Appeals' FAC decision. Service to customers has remained highly reliable. We remain committed to a fourth quarter 2013 closing of the transaction to divest our merchant generation business. The divestiture allows to focus exclusively on our rate regulated utilities. In addition, we remained focused on improving our regulatory frameworks and have seen recent progress on that front in Illinois.","Further, our utility investment plans provide the foundation for growing our rate regulated earnings. In fact, we project rate base will grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 7% over the 5-year period ending in 2017. Finally, Ameren's $1.60 per share annualized dividend rate is well covered by expected 2013 earnings from continuing operations and provides investors with an attractive current yield of approximately 4.5%. This concludes my prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to ask you about the FERC office of energy market request for additional information. It looked like there was -- I guess, they want some more information at least partly because of market power. And also, I'm just wondering what you thought about any potential schedule impact or just what you could tell us more about the interplay with that in your -- getting these plants sold?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. Paul. So you're right. I mean, last week, the FERC did have a, I'll call it a data request but they did ask for additional information with respect to a couple of things. They asked for contracts that we have with 2 customers and they also then asked for some additional information with respect to the market power effects on competition. We have 14 days to respond. We expect to certainly be able to respond within the 14 days. And we don't expect that the additional information they've asked for with respect to the market power impacts to really have any meaningful effect on the data and certainly, no effect overall on the conclusion. So we're going to provide that data as soon as we can, and we're hopeful that there won't be any impact on the overall schedule. We still expect that once the FERC receives that data, they may certainty invite some opportunity for comment on that, but wouldn't expect that it would slow the FERC process down meaningfully, such that, as you heard on the call, we still expect to be able to get FERC approval and close the transaction by year end.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Now I know you guys, obviously, are planning on selling the plants but any thoughts about just sort of the RPM auction and the ability going forward next year's auctions with respect to the potential to sell capacity into PJM, just seams issues, what-have-you? Any thought with respect to what we saw in May and what might be there? Obviously, I know you guys are getting rid of the plants but obviously, you're still working with them. So I just was wondering if you have any thought about that.","Martin J. Lyons","Paul, no, I wouldn't say I have any specific thought with respect to the auction for next year. As you know, the -- this business segment that we're divesting of was successful in getting the ability to sell additional capacity into PJM in periods beyond really the '14 timeframe looking out to post '16. And generally, those prices still look favorable to the prices that exist in MISO today. And so I think just continuing to execute on selling what capacity can be sold into PJM is what that business segment will continue to focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perhaps first, just going back to kind of the merchant business, if you will, just entertain me for one second. I'd be curious if any of the latest regulations kind of change the landscape at all. One hour SO2. Recently, Illinois draft coal ash rules recently released. Does that change anything as far as you're concerned?","Thomas R. Voss","No, it doesn't. Certainly, we're monitoring developments there. But as you know, the decision to exit the merchant business is a strategic decision for us. Really provides us the opportunity to focus exclusively on our rate regulated operations. And so, no, Julien, while we're certainly monitoring conditions and frankly, that business segment that we're selling continues to operate well and perform well, but it's obviously a strategic decision to exit the business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then going back to the Missouri legislation this year. Just kind of a little bit rehashing and thinking about next year, others have alluded to potentially going back for it, perhaps in a little bit more of a diluted approach. Have you put any thoughts to that next year?","Warner L. Baxter","This is Warner Baxter. And so the simple answer is, of course, we're looking at all kinds of options as we look forward to legislation for next year. I mean, certainly, there was a bill that was presented on the senate floor late in the session, which we thought was a good bill. That's certainly an option. We also look at several amendments that were prepared to be discussed and never really got discussed in the floor. Those are potential options. And there are certainly options for even the skinnier version. So what we're going to do and what we've been doing and we'll continue to do is have discussions with key stakeholders to get their input to see what we can do to move constructive legislation forward that will support investment in the state of Missouri. So that's what we'll do. And we'll continue to work with our key allies in Missouri, including all the electric energy providers, to try and craft an appropriate approach forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then a last little detail. Just going back to what you were talking about a second ago in the prepared remarks and I apologize if I missed this, but with regards to the outage here at Callaway, any kind of sense of how significant this would be from a timeline perspective and impact the 3Q results, just initially at least?","Warner L. Baxter","So Julien, this is Warner again. I think Tom said that basically, we still have some more tests that we have to complete. And that will take us through the weekend. But preliminary tests indicate that we haven't incurred any significant damage. And so, if everything we have seen so far, indeed, carries through once we complete our tests, it means that Callaway would -- we would expect that beyond another 15 to 20 days from today to get it back into service. But the tests aren't done and we will get those done through the weekend and we'll have a better assessment, certainty, some time next week.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What would you expect for a ruling after you supply the additional information by August 9?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, this is Marty again, Andy. It's hard to know exactly when they would respond. There's no specific timeline. Once -- you got about 180 days, frankly, to respond and can extend for another 180. But obviously, this request for information indicates to us that they are actively looking at our filing and we would expect FERC based on past practice to move more quickly than the 180 days that are allowed. So no specific deadline, but again, based on past experience, we certainly expect again to get the FERC approval and be able to close by year end. Of course, there's another filing that have been made at the Pollution Control Board and there, the timeline is about 120 days. So in both cases, we expect to get the Pollution Control Board approval for the air variance transfer, as well as the FERC approval for the sale in time still to be able to accomplish a closing before year end.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Moving to low trends, I guess, during the quarter, we've seen some weakness in competitor low trends. Can you just provide a little more clarity on the trends you're seeing across your customer base?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, I'll be happy to comment on that. This year, we've seen a bit of variation, very much like we saw last year. The weather normalized sales started out pretty strong in Q1, but again, like last year, we had some quarterly volatility and we had a bit of contraction in the second quarter. Year-to-date, however, I would say, our residential and commercial sales are up about 0.5%. We said at the end of each of the last 2 quarters that in terms of our 2013 guidance that we expected little in the way of growth. And so, like I said, residential and commercial sales across our utilities are up about 0.5%, and that's we're looking for, for the full year, about 0.5% of growth in residential and commercial sales. With respect to industrial, between Missouri and Illinois, they've been down a little bit this year, primarily in Illinois. Missouri is actually flat to up a little bit. The Illinois trend is a reversal from the past couple of years where we saw really solid increases in industrial sales. But this year, they've turned south a little bit. For the full year, we expect similar kind of patterns for Missouri to be up a little bit in terms of industrial and for Illinois to be down. So those are some of the trends we're seeing. I think -- when I think about the economy and what's going on, what may drive the sales, frankly, in Missouri, the growth in our sales is kind of underscored by some of the things we're seeing in terms of positive movement, job growth, good producing and services jobs, housing starts have been on the rise a little bit, and our customer counts are up. Year-over-year, both residential and commercial residential, up about 0.4%; commericial, about 0.7%. So we're seeing some good trends that give us confidence that 0.5% of growth will be there for the year in residential and commercial and happy to see Missouri industrial sales up a hair this year. So that's generally, I guess, what we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Jenkins with the Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","This is Dan Jenkins. I wonder if you could give me a little more background on this Appellate Court decision on the FAC and Missouri. And then just what the basis was for the decision? And then if it will have any impact on how your FAC operates going forward?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Dan. Maybe Warner will -- who's president of our Missouri operations will take that one again.","Warner L. Baxter","So remember, when you go back to this issue, it really relates to some margins that we realized from certain wholesale contracts. Actually, back several years ago that the Missouri Public Service Commission felt those margins should have been provided back to our fuel adjustment clause like many of our other office system sales are under the existing rules. And these wholesale contracts really stem from some excess power that we had available for sale due to the loss of load from Noranda Aluminum, which is our largest customer, resulting from a severe ice storm in 2009. And so you go back in 2011, the commission issued the order that we had to refund approximately $80 million of margins earned for the period, March '09 to September '09. And we, indeed, recorded that charge back in 2011. That's a pretax charge. That was -- that did not take those contracts through their full duration. Those contracts went further. And so, in 2012, the staff, Missouri Public Commission staff, recommended additional refund of about $26 million related to the same wholesale contracts. And that's from the period from October 2009 to May 2011, whereas the first one was for March 2009-September 2009, that was the period under review. In 2012, just to give you the history so you know, we actually ended up winning our appeal of the commission's order before the Coal County Circuit Court, but later in 2013, which is the Appellate Court decision that Marty referenced, we -- the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld the Missouri Public Service Commission's position. So as a result of all those things, the commission yesterday issued an order requiring that refund of $26 million. And that's about $0.06 per share, as Marty talked about. And so, we, obviously, will comply with that. And while we were disappointed with the commission's decision, we certainty weren't surprised given the recent Appellate Court decision. So really, as we go forward, we will continue to operate under the provisions of the Missouri fuel adjustment clause. We will -- to the extent that we will follow, we really don't have an issue because we don't have similar types of wholesale contracts going forward. We'll just continue to have -- do the off-system sales as we do today and we'll provide 95% of those margins back to the fuel adjustment clause. The one thing that you should know, during all of this period of time, that we actually did file another or initiated another proceeding in the state of Missouri. And this goes back to July 2011, where we filed with the -- a request with the commission for an accounting authority order that allow Ameren Missouri to defer as a regulatory asset. Really, the fixed cost totaling about $36 million that were not recovered from Noranda as a result of that loss of the load back in 2009. So now that all of these other decisions have been put behind us, the commission now still has before it another docket to potentially provide us an accounting authority order for those losses that we incurred as a result of that loss of load. So a bit of a long story, but that gave you sort of the history of what's going on with the fuel adjustment clause and where things stand today. And so there is no set timetable for the commission to make a decision on this accounting authority order request, but we think the decks are now clear for them to take that up in the relative near future.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And you don't intend to appeal that under the Supreme Court, the appellate ...?","Warner L. Baxter","The appeal of the Supreme court, no, we don't tend to do that. There are certain provisions of the commission's order which we may look to appeal, not the entire $26 million, but another smaller component of that, about $3 million that we think may have been addressed in the prior rate case settlement, that's still under review. But beyond that, no, we do not plan to take this up to the Supreme Court.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then just what's your regulatory schedule, I guess, in Missouri? You don't currently have it filed as -- but you have talked in the past about being a more regular rate case scheduled. Should they expect something coming up in the next few months?","Warner L. Baxter","Dan, we haven't made any final decisions as to when we'll file our next rate case. But just as we've done in the past, we'll seek to time the filing of our next case to mitigate regulatory lag. And that's regulatory lag resulting from meaningful capital additions, as well as to mitigate regulatory lag for operating costs. And so, when we look at those things, obviously, we just completed a rate case at the end of last year, we'll be mindful of those types of things, as well as capital additions that we have coming before us in a variety of different areas, not just in '13 but in '14. So a final decision hasn't been made, but we keep a very close eye on all these things in terms of when we'll file our next rate case.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then the last thing I has is you had a slide show on the cash flow and the fact it will be negative, I just wondered if you could update us what your financing plans are coming up.","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Dan. this is Marty again. So in terms of financing plans, as you probably know from looking at our balance sheet, really nothing in terms of short-term debt at this point have good liquidity. So we'll be looking at this year as some of the maturities that, I believe, we talked to you about last quarter, that we have coming up, both in Missouri and Illinois. And then we've got -- the negative cash flow is really being driven by the capital expenditure plans we have overall. So we'll be taking a look again at those maturities, plus the cash flows driven by the rate base growth and then refinancing those when they get to levels that we think are appropriate to take to the financial market. As we look right now, some of that financing may be done in the second half of this year, some of it may slip to the first quarter of next year. So -- but those are the plans. And then, of course, next year, we've got the debt up at the holding company that you're aware of that we'll be looking at refinancing options. Those come up in May of next year, May '14. And certainly, we've got the opportunity there, as we talked about before, to significantly lower the interest rate of that -- the parent company debt. And, Dan, while I've got you, one thing I want to tack on to Warner's thing, it's just important, is that the charge we took relative to the FAC that when we had the similar one in a prior period, but those are fully behind us, those sales that were in question happened during the finite period of time, the FAC was later modified to address those kinds of things. So it's not an issue that will be recurring going forward. So that $0.06 item was a bit of a onetime item this year and in terms of it not happening again in the future. And we did include it in our core, if you will, earnings from operating activities. But that is not something that would repeat in future periods.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolf Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","So listen, on the Illinois Rivers, just -- do you agree that the ALJ recommendation was adopted largely as it is? I mean, how much of an impact might it have on the CapEx for that project? I mean, obviously, there were some segments here.","Martin J. Lyons","Steve, we have with us here today the president of that subsidiary in segment, Maureen Borkowski. I think I'll let her address your question.","Maureen A. Borkowski","I think the question is if the ALJ order was approved as is, how would it affect our CapEx? Realistically, what would happen is it would probably trigger another proceeding if the order was approved as is. We would have 7 of the 9 line segments approved for routing, as well as several of the substations, we would be moving out on those. And then we would need additional clarity on the remaining 2 segments and the substations. The issue is not really whether or not those things are needed and whether or not they're going to be built, it's just a matter of what the route is. With regard to the 2 line segments that the ALJ didn't recommend approval of, the route was somewhat in question because there was a question about where the locations that were the terminating points of those line segments should be. With regard to the substations that they didn't recommend approval of, the issue was really with regard to the use of the facilities and sites of some existing Ameren Illinois company substations that were nearby. And whether or not we needed new sites adjacent to those facilities or if those existing facilities could be utilized. So it's really just a matter of getting clarity around those issues. So the bottom line is, if the ALJ order was adopted as is, we still wouldn't expect it to significantly affect our capital investment. We'll probably have another proceeding that was a follow-on to clarify the remaining issues. We're hopeful, though, that the response that we provided to some of the issues the ALJs had raised will be clarified in a commission order that's due on August 20. Did that answer your question?","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Yes, that's very helpful. And I think on Dynegy's call this morning, they talked about continued and worsening congestion issues in the region and potential transmission needs for that. Can you talk about whether you're seeing more opportunities in your transition business to address that issue?","Maureen A. Borkowski","We certainly are always looking forward to new transmission investment opportunities. But as you know, the regional transmission plan is really designed by MISO. So we continue to work with the Midwest ISO and with Dynegy and other entities, about addressing some of the congestion issues. But MISO has to work that through their lengthy stakeholder transmission planning process, and any needed improvements have to be determined within the course of the parameters that their transmission plan sets up. Most of the time, I would think these kinds of projects would have to be either reliability or market efficiency projects. We're certainty continuing to propose projects that would address some of these issues, but they have to work their way through the planning process.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. One last question, I guess, for Tom. I think on the last call, you mentioned that there's going to be kind of a board retreat in June, might have been a response to a question on dividend strategy and dividend growth. Anything come out of that on -- in terms of the kind of thinking on dividend strategy and even just how the company looks once this generation transaction is completed?","Thomas R. Voss","Sure. We did have a, what I would view as a successful strategy update session with our board in June. They bought into the management's plan about growing -- how we anticipate to grow the business by making investments. We're totally supportive of that approach and they're very much in favor of us as we grow earnings, as we grow the rate base and grow earnings, that we would also grow the dividend over a period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.","Kevin Fallon","I just wanted to see if I could get a little bit more color in terms of the regulatory lag issue in Missouri. And in particular, how fast are you incurring lag, and what's a reasonable amount of lag to accept before you file?","Warner L. Baxter","This is Warner Baxter. When you look at regulatory lag in Missouri, it's driven by a couple of things. Number one, it's driven by the fact that they use historical tests here, principally, to set rates. Another big driver is that when capital investments are placed into service between rate cases, there's now an ability to update rates for those major adjustments. And so, what we have been doing as a company is that we've been working very hard and had success in better aligning our spend across our enterprise, both capital and O&M to be more consistent with the regulatory framework that we have in front of us in the state of Missouri. And so we've been able to manage that and we continue to do that going forward. But of course, there will be some point where we're going to have to file rate cases. And what we've been very focused on is narrowing that gap between the allowed return on equity provided by the commission and what our actual earned return on equity has been and we've been able to do that over the last several years pretty successfully. So I wouldn't say there's a magical number or a magical timeframe, we just know that we're going to manage our operations and manage consistent with that and keep a fairly narrow gap and that's what our plan has been and will continue to be.","Kevin Fallon","Is it too precise to say that you guys are hopeful that you can stay out until you have another shot at the legislation? Or is that too fine a point?","Warner L. Baxter","Kevin, I would say that's too fine a point. We'll do what we think is right for the business, what we think is right for shareholders. And that's when we'll file rate cases, as well as, frankly, we think legislation isn't just about how we earn better returns. We think it's in the best interest, frankly, of the state of Missouri and its customers. And so, bottom line, we're trying to create a win-win for everybody.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And in terms of financing plans, as we look over the next couple of years, you guys obviously have a big CapEx buildout. Could you give us some color in terms of the need for equity or target capital ratios for the consolidated firm?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, this is Marty again. We've provided these over time. I think we look to keep the equity content and the cap structure over time, around that 50-50 kind of level where we are today. So we think that's a target that we'd have going forward. We haven't given any specific guidance on any need for equity. Obviously, we've got a strong, we believe, rate base growth plan, capital expenditure plan, expect to be able to grow rate base 7% annually out through 2017, as we mentioned earlier. Largely, we believe that will be funded by the reinvestment of retained earnings as our -- from the earnings we got in the business and the growth in the earnings going forward coupled with that financing. To the extent that we needed some supplemental equity, which we're not issuing any currently, but would have the ability to turn on our DRIP or 401(k) or utilize those programs to generate additional equity. But again, we're not doing that currently and we would make that decision on a year-by-year basis going forward.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And just last a last question. I just want to confirm that if the ALJ position is upheld on the Illinois Rivers project, that even if you have to seek a second proceeding to get the full amount of the substations and lines completed, the construction on the project as a whole will move forward as scheduled and it's kind of an add-on to that incremental process that you would need to go through? In others, it wouldn't delay the spending of the CapEx.","Maureen A. Borkowski","This is Maureen. Yes, that's is correct. I mean, the encouraging news about the ALJ order is that they completely endorse the need for the project and said that Illinois River is the best approach. So really, this issue with regard to the substations and the remaining 2 line segments is about where they should be, not whether or not they're needed. So yes, we would move out on the segments and the stations that have been approved and then would work through the issues with regard to the routing of the remaining segments and stations. It would not impact the CapEx plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Rajeev Lalwani on Stephen's team. I just have a question on a comment you made in Missouri, the cost referral that you're seeking relating to Noranda, is that kind of a one-time thing or will that carry forward?","Warner L. Baxter","Rajeev, this is Warner Baxter. This would be really kind of a one-time thing. The event was the loss fixed cost resulting from the ice storm and so it would be a one-time event. And so the commission is in the county authority order and then if we'd be granted that county authority ordered, then we would seek to put the commission's decision into rates during our next rate case.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And the other question was on Illinois. As we see the 30-year treasury go up, why is that not impacting your expected earnings for the business? Or is it too small to have much of an impact?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. No, it is embedded in there. So we have seen the 30-year treasuries rise this year, but it is having -- it's up, I guess, about 30 basis points from where we started our guidance at the beginning of the year and 30 basis points for this year is about $0.015. So that is embedded in the overall guidance. If you look at the guidance we've provided, and I think somebody did this last time, took a $2 to $2.15 range and then added back the parent and other of $0.20 to get to a midpoint of a range around our regulated earnings, which gets you to about $2.27 or $2.28, somewhere in that range. We started the year with regulated earnings expectations of $2.25. After the first quarter, we raised it to a midpoint of about $2.30 and again, there's a range around these numbers. We didn't have anything specifically and therefore the $0.06 FAC charge, frankly, as Warner said earlier, could have gone either way, been a $0.06 charge or a $0.04 upside. The fact that we have this $0.06 charge is the reason that we're bringing down the upper end of our range from $2.20 to $2.15. But my point is that we brought down that midpoint only $0.02 or $0.03. Based on that charge, we're seeing a little bit of upside from the -- from those 30-year treasuries, and we're also controlling our cost to help offset some of that. And bottom line, it's steady as she goes in terms of regulated earnings for this year. We've been between that $2.25 and $2.30 midpoint, we're still there even after this FAC charge at about that $2.27 to $2.28 range. So those are some of the things that we're incorporating. We had a Callaway refueling outage in the second quarter. The result of that as we've shared in our talking points, it was $0.08 for the quarter, $0.09 for the year, right in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. So all in all, it's -- we're -- things are in line through 6 months.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just another follow-up question on Illinois. In terms of the new legislation there, it seem like it didn't have much of an impact on your numbers. Can you just talk about why that is? And I was under the impression that it will improve the delta between earned and the lag going forward.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, you're asking about the Illinois Electric in particular?","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, sorry.","Adam C. Heflin","Yes. So the reason it didn't have a -- really, a big impact on this year is that it will have a positive impact going forward. So Tom went through some of the things that are underscored which is use of the year end rate base, the actual year end cap structure, as well as in weighted average cost to capital returns on deferrals. One of the things in our talking points we did talk about is that coming out of the first year of the use of the legislation, there's actually a deferral that is actually a liability back to the customers. And so, when you look at the weighted average cost of capital return on that, that is actually an incremental obligation which mitigates the positive impact of the other 2 items, the year end rate base and the actual cap structure. So for the year, it was a bit of a neutral. As we go through time, this is what was in our talking points, we go through time and we deploy the capital in order to improve the infrastructure, create the jobs per the Act, we expect those deferrals to be actually regulatory assets and would expect them to -- the weighted average cost of capital returns on those. So this year, it kind of netted out to not really having much of an impact. But going forward, those fixes to the legislation are necessary and will be positive overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","My question has been answered.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just coming back to Ameren Illinois real quick. I want to make sure I understand, we've seen this with Commonwealth Edison, what is the amount of -- on the electric side of items of cost that the commission does not include in the formula rate process. Meaning, that creates a little bit of structural earnings -- structural underearning. I don't think it's a huge number, but when you think about kind of going for 2014, 2015 and beyond.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Michael, I wish I had that in front of me. We went through some of this, actually, coming out of our year end call and perhaps Doug can find the slide. What we did coming at year end, we gave our guidance for this year. So we actually laid out some of the items that actually we expected to cause some under earning this year. Actually Doug wasn't able to pull that out. The things we laid out at that time, Michael, were about $8 million of ICC ratemaking adjustments. Those are things that unless we're able to find some other way to mitigate those or to get recovery, those would be sort of recurring. We laid out, and this was back -- it was in Slide 13 by the way in the year end call, we made about $7 million of electric system rework that we plan to do and are doing this year, and that would not be recoverable. However, while those costs were incurred this year and last year, we don't expect that those costs would be sort of going-forward cost. We believe that, that rework is largely behind us after this year. So we'd not expect that to continue to be a driver of underearning. And then, with the $1 million this -- we have this year, it was greater last year, we had $1 million this year of required donations under the formula rates, and of course, we continue to make those donations going forward and those are nonrecoverable. So I think what we laid out there was about $60 million or so of items impacting us this year, both the expectation that, that would go down to maybe in the $9 million range next year. And so that's sort of the guidance we provided.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So when investors think longer-term about the Illinois Electric business, should they basically think, look, on the distribution or delivery side, you're likely to -- there's nothing structural that keeps you -- that keeps the rate base math from happening. Meaning kind of taking an end of year rate base multiplying times whatever the equity layer is and then just taking the 30-year treasury plus 580 bps. And then maybe subtracting out those structural items you just -- the nonrecoverable items you just talked.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Michael, that's right. You should look for it. It should be -- it should work formulaically as -- obviously, when we got started last year with these reviews, there were certainly some debate around some of these historical ICC ratemaking adjustments or how the law would be implemented. Those historical ICC ratemaking adjustments will continue per the law. We believe we've gotten clarity from the legislature in terms of the some of the issues that were debated with the ICC. But generally, you're right, Michael, we should have rate base growth going forward. The ratemaking should work formulaically as designed. And as the 30-year treasury, say, if they do rise, then that will impact the overall return. And I think, next year, I think that blue chip consensus forecast we use right now, it's at 3.95, which would imply for next year if that held through a 9.75 return in the Illinois energy delivery space.","Operator","Mr. Fischer, we have no further questions at this time.

Welcome to the Ameren Corporation's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Mr. Kirk you may begin.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that's accurate only as of the date of today's call and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that we will be referenced during this presentation.","As noted on page 2 of the presentation comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements including \u2013 include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.","For additional information concerning these factors please read the Forward-looking Statements section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC. Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here's Warner who will start on page 4 of our presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Andrew. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.78 per share compared to $0.62 per share earned in 2018. Year-over-year increase of $0.16 per share reflected the benefits of increased infrastructure investments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of first quarter results are described on this slide.","Ameren Illinois Natural Gas earnings increased as a result of higher delivery service rates incorporating increased infrastructure investments and a change in rig design. Increased infrastructure investments also drove higher earnings at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution each of which benefits from formulaic ratemaking. Ameren Missouri earnings also rose reflecting higher weather-driven electric retail sales and energy efficiency performance incentives that offset the impact of timing differences in 2018 related to federal tax reform. Marty will discuss these and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment.","I am also pleased to report that we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan and remain on track to deliver within our 2019 earnings guidance range of $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share.","Moving to page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan which we have been executing very well over the last several years. We expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for shareholders.","As you can see on the right side of this page during the first three months of this year we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to better serve our customers. Each segment is carrying out comprehensive grid modernization plans and we continue to believe the pipeline of potential investments remains robust. Of course we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable and earn returns close to the allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions.","Moving now to page 6, for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's, Renewable Energy Standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. Ameren Missouri has reached agreements with two developers to acquire after construction up to 557 megawatts of wind generation representing about 80% of our compliance needs under the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard.","In early March the Missouri PSC approved our Certificate of Convenience and Necessity Request for the proposed 157-megawatt facility to be located in Northwestern, Missouri. Now 557 megawatts off wind generation have been approved by the Missouri PSC.","Additional key milestones for each wind facility are to finalize MISO interconnection costs and obtain transmission interconnection agreements. These two wind generation facilities collectively represent an approximate $1 billion investment and are expected to be in service by the end of 2020. Of course, we are not done.","Our team continues to actively negotiate with developers for additional wind generation to comply with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. Any additional investments in wind generation will be incremental to the five-year capital and rate-base growth plan discussed on our call in February. We remain confident in our ability to complete these negotiations, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and have these facilities constructed in a timely fashion. We believe these investments will deliver clear long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and the environment.","Moving now to page seven and an update on Illinois business activities. Today, there was legislation pending in both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Illinois General Assembly that would extend the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act beyond the December 2022 sunset date and continue performance metrics and energy assistance programs to low-income consumers.","Since 2012, this constructive electric regulatory framework included in this legislation has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid. Ameren Illinois has installed hundreds of miles of storm-resistent utility poles and power lines along with advanced technology that detects service disruptions and immediately reroutes power.","In addition, more than one million smart meters are providing customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills. These investments have contributed to a 20% overall improvement in reliability since 2012. In addition, our investments in infrastructure enabled by this constructive energy policy have created approximately 1400 new jobs in Illinois.","Finally, we've been able to make all of these investments and create jobs while keeping customer rates well below the Midwest and national averages. We expect that all-in 2020 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois will be lower by approximately 1% since electric formula ratemaking began in 2012, even after incorporating substantial infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and the communities we serve.","With these benefits in mind, I am pleased to report that House Bill 3152 which would extend the formula rate framework for 10 years from 2022 to 2032 passed the public utilities committee in mid-April. This Bill is now pending before the full House of Representatives. House Bill 2080 awaits action by the full Senate. If either of these bills is enacted, it will help to ensure that Illinois continues to be one of the leading states for grid modernization.","Policymakers have already extended formula rates twice since 2012 and we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. In addition, there are several other legislative proposals that we are monitoring. As you would expect, we're carefully analyzing these proposals and engaging with key stakeholders with an eye towards ensuring that any changes to state energy policy are in the best long-term interest of Ameren Illinois customers. The legislative session ends on May 31.","Moving to page 8. To sum of our value proposition, we believe that the execution of our strategy in 2019 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. In February, we rolled forward our five-year growth plan which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2018 to 2023 period using 2018 weather-normalized core earnings per share as a base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by an expected 8% compound annual rate base growth over the same period.","Our strong earnings growth expectation positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook combined with our solid dividend which currently provides a yield of approximately 2.7%, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.","Now before I turn the call over to Marty, I would like to mention two recent and important additions to our disclosures on environmental, social and governance matters. First, in March, we published a report called Building a Cleaner Energy Future. This report outlines how we are effectively managing and balancing climate-related risks. And just last week, we issued our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. Both reports are available at amereninvestors.com. I would also like to call your attention two slides in the appendix of our presentation today dedicated to environmental, social and governance matters.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner and good morning everyone. Turning now to page 10 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.78 per share compared to earnings of $0.62 per share for the year-ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.16 per share increase are highlighted by segment on this page.","Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.05 reflecting higher delivery service rates that were effective in November 2018 incorporating increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE as well as a change in rate design. The first quarter 2019 benefit from the change in rate design is not expected to impact full year results.","Earnings for Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were up $0.03 and $0.02 respectively reflecting increased infrastructure investments. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment reported earnings that were also up though slightly. The results reflected higher electric retail sales due in part to colder winter temperatures in 2019 compared to the year-ago period, which contributed approximately $0.03 per share as well as recognition of MIA performance incentives related to the 2013 and 2016 energy efficiency plans, which contributed $0.05 per share. These favorable factors offset $0.08 of timing differences in 2018 between income tax expense and revenue reductions related to federal tax reform. These timing differences will impact 2019 quarterly earnings comparisons, but are not expected to impact the full year comparison.","Finally, Ameren Parent and Other results increased $0.06 reflecting a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and timing of income tax expense. This income tax expense item is not expected to impact full year results.","Before moving on let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first three months of this year compared to the first three months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased about 1% excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under MIA.","Kilowatt-hour sale to Missouri industrial customers decreased 3% after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude MIA effects, because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.","Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased about 1.5% and kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter the cause did not affect our earnings, since we have full revenue decoupling.","Moving to page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2019 earnings guidance. We're off to a solid start in 2019 and as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2019 diluted earnings to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February.","I will note that our second quarter earnings comparison will be negatively impacted at Ameren Missouri by the return to normal weather and the spring 2019 Callaway refueling and maintenance outage. Together, these two items are expected to reduce second quarter earnings by approximately $0.30 per share year-over-year. I encourage you to take this into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results.","In addition, we expect the first quarter timing differences related to income tax expense in Ameren Missouri and Ameren Parent to cause quarterly variations for the balance of the year. However, they are not expected to impact the full year earnings comparison.","Moving now to page 12 for a discussion of select regulatory matters. Last Friday Ameren Missouri provided a 60-day notice to the Missouri Public Service Commission of its intention to file for an electric rate review, which we plan to file as early as July.","Some of the key drivers of this rate review include increased infrastructure investments and other costs of service, and it will incorporate lower coal and transportation expenses into base rates.","Base rates were last reset, April 1 2017 and are required to be reset at least every four years to allow for continued use of the fuel adjustment clause. This filing will allow us to meet that requirement and provide flexibility to time our next rate review to include our wind generation investments. We will provide additional information when we file and won't go into any further details today.","Our goal remains to invest in energy infrastructure to improve customer service and satisfaction while keeping rates affordable and keeping earned returns close to the allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions.","Moving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution regulatory matters, last month we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing, requesting a $7 million base rate decrease.","Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true-up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year.","Turning to page 13, for Ameren Transmission there have been recent developments that may impact the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners. In November 2018, the FERC issued an order in the MISO ROE complaint cases proposing a new methodology for determining the base allowed ROE. The MISO transmission owners, including Ameren filed initial briefs and reply briefs regarding the proposed new methodology.","We believe the FERC proposed methodology with certain modifications, would be an improvement over the existing approach. In addition, in March the FERC issued two notices of inquiry regarding transmission ROEs and incentives. The base ROE notice of inquiry broadens stakeholder input beyond the parties to ongoing complaint cases.","The transmission incentives notice of inquiry seeks comments on FERC's electric transmission incentives policy. We are unable to predict the timing and ultimate impact of the proposed ROE methodology on the complaint cases or the notices of inquiry at this time.","Finally, turning to page 14 I will summarize. We expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2019 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by rate base growth and disciplined financial management.","Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. In addition, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to our peers.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Julien.","Nick Campanella","Hey. Good morning. This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien today.","Warner Baxter","Hey, Nick. How are you doing?","Nick Campanella","Hey, good and I hope you guys are doing well too.","Warner Baxter","We are. Thank you.","Nick Campanella","Just to kick it off here. I know that you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, the Missouri rate review is for the timing of some of these wind investments and whatnot, but just given you have the RESRAM there and then also the PISA, and the fact that the fuel tracker, it implies that it doesn't need to be renewed until 2021. I guess the question is why now?","Marty Lyons","Yeah, sure, Nick. This is Marty. Thanks for the question. So as we said on the call, we do plan to file for an electric rate case as early as July. Recall that we've been saying for a while that we expected to file between May 1 of this year 2019 and May 1, 2020. We really have to file before May 1 of 2020 in order to keep the fuel adjustment clause. And, of course, our rate case when you think about it, Missouri typically takes 11 months and only allows for rate base true-ups to a date about six months post-filing.","So those are some considerations or constraints when you think about the timing of these cases and you think about the wind assets being completed in late 2020. So in any event as we said on the call, the file in July allows us to do a couple of things; updates rates for infrastructure investments and other cost of service that have changed over the past few years and incorporate these lower coal and transportation costs into base rates; and then number two, it provides us flexibility around the timing of that next rate review to include the wind.","A couple things to note related to your question. I mean, our last rate update was in April of 2017. It was based on a 3\/31\/16 test year with the true-up to 12\/31\/16 so it has been a few years. And, of course, the PISA that we began to use late in 2018, again didn't apply to any rate base infrastructure investments made before that date. So those types of things would be picked up in this base rate increase.","With regard to your prospective question on the wind assets, I mean you're right. The PISA and RESRAM will allow investors to make sure that they're whole in terms of the return on the wind. But as you might recall both the cash and the recognition of a full equity return will not be recognized until after a subsequent rate review. So including those wind assets in a rate review will be important in that regard.","Nick Campanella","That was very clear. I appreciate it. I guess just on financing the plan. I think everyone saw Moody's come out with a lower floated debt target at the parent. Has this changed your equity need for the wind CapEx at all in your mind?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. Nick thanks again for the question. So, look the bottom line answer to your question is, no. We still feel like the financing plans we talked about on the second quarter call are appropriate. You recall that as it relates to equity that includes issuing equity through our dividend reinvestment employee benefit plans over the course of the next five years, it's about $100 million per year.","And then also incremental common equity issuance to fund a portion of our ultimate total wind investment. And so those are the plans that we have and we're going to stick with those. I appreciate your question about the Moody's action though.","Just one consideration amongst the number when we think about financing our business going forward, we were pleased with the action Moody's took. For those on the call, you'll recall that our Ameren Corp. issuer rating at S&P is a BBB+ with a stable outlook. There we have an FFO-to-debt threshold of 13%. At Moody's we have a BAA1 issuer rating with -- also with a stable outlook. And there's where as Nick points out, Moody's lowered the threshold on the cash flows from operations pre-working capital to total debt. They lowered that threshold from 19% to 17%.","So we are pleased that Moody's took that action. We believe it brings us that threshold closer in line with our peers. And certainly it does provide us some more flexibility with regard to financing within that range. But again it's just one consideration that we think about when we look at financing the business. We've always looked to maintain very strong balance sheets.","On our call in February we said, one of our expectations over the next five years was to be able to maintain capitalization structures similar to those that existed at year-end and as existed March 31. And we seek to make sure that as we carry out these infrastructure investments including the wind that we position those for success in the regulatory proceedings that follow. So there are lot of things that we take into consideration but bottom line is we expect the financing plan we laid out in February to continue to be our plan going forward.","Nick Campanella","Hey, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll leave it there. Congrats on a strong quarter.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Nick.","Warner Baxter","Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Hey, good morning. Just one question on the wind investments. Maybe just a quick update on beyond the 700 megawatts that you guys plan to have by the end of 2020. Have your strategy or outlook changed on the incremental megawatts through the 2023 planning horizon?","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Insoo. How are you doing?","Insoo Kim","Good.","Warner Baxter","I appreciate the question. This is Warner. No, the bottom line is, no. As we said before we are focused on obtaining at least 700 megawatts of additional wind generation. And as I said on the call a moment ago, we continue to negotiate with developers for that additional wind generation. And we remain confident in our ability not only to negotiate successfully with those developers, but also to move through the regulatory approval process and get the facilities constructed in a timely fashion.","So while we like to point to 700 megawatts, I mean we're very pleased with the fact that as we sit here today we have 557 megawatts not only negotiated, but approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission. So Michael Moehn and his team have worked effectively with stakeholders to get those deals across the finish line from an approval perspective. And so we look forward to bringing more to the Missouri Public Service Commission in the future.","Keeping in mind as you I'm sure understand that trying to find projects that fit just nicely into 700 megawatts that just is not likely just because projects don't come in sort of byte sizes. And so as we look forward we'll look forward to the next deal to get done in a timely fashion and get it across the finish line.","Insoo Kim","Yes, that's clear. And then in terms of the rate case filing. Beyond this rate case cycle and given the different mechanisms you do have in place like PISA and RESRAM is it -- should we expect the next timing of the Missouri rate case to be at least two to three years down the line to meet the every 4-year requirement? Or could we see a potential filing sooner than that?","A \u2013 Marty Lyons","Yes. This is Marty again. Look, we'd like to have as much time as possible between rate case filings. As I mentioned, it's this next one we plan to file this next rate review in July would represent three years between the last one and this one and is somewhat being driven by the infrastructure investments made prior to PISA, but also driven by as I mentioned earlier the expected timing of our wind investments and the timing of the next rate case.","So I wouldn't read anything into that other than what we've laid out in terms of future cycles or periods of time between cases. Again we said many times that the fuel adjustment clause does require us to file for rate reviews at least every four years. So I would say four years or less, but we'd like to make the period as great as possible frankly.","Insoo Kim","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Good morning guys. Just on Illinois. As you know there's a legislation -- there's lot of legislative activity I guess going on there with both the utilities and non-utilities or budgetary related kind of issues.","And I'm just wondering sort of how you see the politics sort of working there procedurally? And whether or not the EIMA extension bill might get wrapped in with others? Or just sort of how you see all that stuff sort of unfolding?","And sort of just in general the I know you guys don't own generation in Illinois, but just how you look at the capacity procurement legislation vis-\u00e0-vis potential -- just how it might influence you or just your thoughts on that if you'd like to opine on that?","Warner Baxter","Sure Paul. This is Warner and I invite Richard Mark to add anything after I offer some of these comments. Look talking about the EIMA provision -- or the modernization act that we've been talking about that I referred to in my talking points. ","Look we certainly can't predict what happens here over the next several weeks. But the only thing we can say about that legislation is that, it has produced significant benefits for all stakeholders. Our customers the state of Illinois and certainly our shareholders and I've outlined those benefits in terms of reliability, affordability, job creation and really driving a more modernized grid in Illinois.","So as a result when we think about what might happen here over the next several weeks, the fact that that legislation or that policy has been so strong and has been extended twice that puts us in a good position. We believe for legislators to take notice that this is something that we want to continue.","And so I think this is why you saw the strong votes in the committee and Rich and his team has done a great job with many other stakeholders to position two bills, one in the House and one in the Senate to move forward.","So we can't predict right now where they stand. They stand with nothing else on them. And certainly we will -- hopefully that will -- the way it will continue here over the next several weeks.","As you said before, you're right. There are several legislative proposals in Illinois that relate to what I would call energy policy. And look I think our vested interest in all of those bills is what the impact could be on our customers. And so we are at the table working with stakeholders to make sure that our customer\u2019s best interest are being looked out for.","Now I'm not going to comment on any particular piece of legislation at this point. Yes there is certainly legislation out there related to the capacity markets, related principally to Exelon, but it's just -- it's too uncertain to see just exactly where they may or may not be here over the next several weeks and\/or in a veto session. So Richard I highlighted at a very high level. Is there anything else that you would like to add?","Richard Mark","Thanks, Warner. I thought you covered it really good, but I would just add that as you said the policymakers have seen this legislation twice. Many of them have voted on extending it twice. They've seen the job creation that formula rates have brought to the state of Illinois and the value of it. So they're familiar with it and I think that's a benefit as they look at it going forward.","Warner Baxter ","I agree. Thank you.","Paul Patterson","But let's just say for whatever reason because there are lots of I mean going beyond the merits of the legislation just -- if it does for whatever reason shocking or not that it may be that they don't get to this session if it goes to the veto session or next could it be addressed -- is there any timing issue that we should be concerned about if it doesn't get past this legislation? I mean this session.","Warner Baxter","Yes, Paul. So look I think as I said, this legislative session ends on May 31. And so as you know in Illinois it is possible that legislation can be passed during the veto session. And so while that's the case look I'll tell you that Rich and his team are focused on getting this important legislation passed this legislative session not the veto session. And so for all the reasons before we were hopeful that that will happen. And if it gets to the veto session look we'll just cross that bridge if and when we come to it but right now we're very focused on getting this across the line this veto session by May 31.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. And then just on the Missouri rate case. Can you give us any sort of rough sense as to how much you might be seeking or just \u2013 I mean, know it's early but you guys have filed noticed. It's going to be a couple of months before we're going to get the full details but is there any rough sense you want to give to us as to what the impact can be on that?","Marty Lyons ","Paul, this is Marty. No. We'll make that filing and let it speak for itself. I mean I think we gave you some of the broad outline of what it will include which is not only the increased rate base and infrastructure investments over the past few years and changes in cost of service, but also noted that it will also incorporate in the base rates the lower coal and transportation costs which we've begun to realize over the past year. And so those are some of the broad things that will be included but no further specificity at this time.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Marty Lyons ","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Rice from Suntenise [ph]. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. Congrats on a good call. Most of my questions have been answered. Just really quickly this rate case is it going to include the wind the 557 megawatts?","- Martin Lyons ","Greg, it's Marty. No, it would not. I mean again that's -- I mentioned it as the key consideration because in this case it won't. The wind won't be included in the rate review until it's actually in service. And so it's a key consideration on why we're filing now to provide visibility in terms of the next rate review to be able to pick up that wind investment once it's placed in service which again we expect to be in late 2020.","Michael Moehn ","Yes. I would just note -- this is Michael Moehn. I mean the true-up period with respect to this case assuming it's filed in July would be most likely through the end of 2019.","Unidentified Analyst","Gotcha. Perfect. And then just any update on kind of how negotiations are going on the incremental wind?","Warner Baxter","So, Michael, I noted -- this is Warner, I noted a little bit before that we're negotiating with developers. And any particular insights you want to offer at this point in time?","Marty Lyons","No. I'll just echo what you said is that we remain confident that we're going to get this done. We're very focused on it, making good progress and very focused on making sure that we meet the renewable standard by the end of 2020.","Warner Baxter","And to your point, look, I think Mike and his team have been working very hard to make sure we get the best deal for our customers, right? This is why we want to make sure we're thoughtful about it. Of course, we're mindful of 2020 and we're confident getting that done. We want to get the best deal for our customers and so that's exactly what we're doing.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan from Verition. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Mr. Ashar.","Ashar Khan","Hi. How are you doing, Warner? Good earnings.","Warner Baxter","Thank you. Thank you. ","Ashar Khan","Can I just ask you -- just wanted to -- you laid down the factors for the remaining three quarters. So, can you just talk a little bit about the O&M? O&M was to be a little bit lower this year, Marty, and I wanted to check how that went versus the first quarter? Or are most of those savings going to come in the last three quarters?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. Ashar, thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. So we guided at the beginning of the year when we talked about 2019 that excluding the impacts of the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage that we expected lower operations and maintenance expenses about $0.05 year-over-year from 2018 to 2019. And Ashar, we're tracking well against that expectation.","You will recall that last year some of those higher O&M costs did come in the latter part of the year associated with some outages at non-nuclear plants as well as other costs. So my recollection is those were kind of back-end loaded last year but we are on track to achieve that $0.05 year-over-year improvement.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. ","Warner Baxter","Thank you, Ashar. ","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Ashar.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you for participating in the call.

And welcome to the Ameren Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this is conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Director of IR for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Fischer. You may now begin.","Doug Fischer","Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m Doug Fischer, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Tom Voss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marty Lyons, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call is being broadcast live on the internet and the webcast will be available for one year on our website at ameren.com.","Further, this call contains time sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.","To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on our website that will be referenced by our speakers. To access this presentation, please look in the Investors section of our website under Webcasts and Presentations, and follow the appropriate link.","Turning to page two of the presentation, I need to inform you that comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance.","We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in the forward-looking statements. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statement section in the news release we issued today and the forward-looking statements and risk factor sections in our filings with the SEC.","Tom will begin this call with an overview of third quarter 2012 earnings and 2012 guidance, followed by a discussion of recent regulatory and business developments. Marty will follow with more detailed discussions of third quarter 2012 financial results and regulatory and other financial matters. We will then open the call for your questions.","Here is Tom, who will start on page three of the presentation.","Tom Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before I discuss our earnings, I would like to acknowledge that terrible impact Hurricane Sandy has had on our fellow citizens in the Northeast. The storm has reminded us again, how the forces of Mother Nature can change lives. Sandy will no doubt go down as one of the worst storms ever to hit our country.","Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have lost love ones from this devastating storm and also to those effected in so many other ways by the storm including those whose homes and businesses has suffered severe damage and loss power.","At the request of Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois dispatched crews to respond to the storm even before hit the region, so that our teams would be in position to restore power as soon as possible.","Currently, there are more than 650 Ameren electric and gas employees and Ameren contractors, nearly 250 pieces of heavy equipment deployed in New Jersey. I want to personally thank all of the Ameren personnel who are working long hours to restore power in the Northeast.","Now I would like to turn to a discussion of our earnings and update you on other important matters. Today we announced third quarter 2012 core earnings of $1.33 per share, compared to third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share.","Third quarter was solid from an operations perspective with our system and people performing very well under extended severe weather conditions. Overall, earnings were in line with our expectations despite a challenging Illinois electric delivery rate order.","The decrease in third quarter 2012 core earnings compared to third quarter 2011 core earnings reflect a lower results from both our Regulated Utility and Merchant Generation businesses.","Ameren Illinois\u2019 earnings were negatively impact by the Illinois Commerce Commission September 2012 rate order for electric delivery service and a change in the quarterly distribution of revenues and earnings resulting from formula ratemaking.","In addition, Ameren Missouri\u2019s core earnings declined due to lower electric sales and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by the benefit of our 2011 electric rate adjustment. Third quarter 2012 temperatures while warmer than normal or similar to those experience in the third quarter of 2011.","Core earnings from our Merchant Generation business also declined compared to third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower power prices and higher fuel costs. Marty will provide more details on our earnings in a few minutes.","Turning to page four, today we also affirmed that the $2.40 per share midpoint of our 2012 core earnings guidance and narrow the range to that guidance to $2.35 to $2.45 per share from prior range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. The midpoints of core earnings guidance for our Regulated Utilities and our Merchant Generation business remained $2.30 per share and $0.10 per share, respectively.","I\u2019m pleased to also report that in addition to our solid operating performance during this past summer\u2019s extended heat wave, two of our coal-fired Missouri Energy Centers recently earned positive national recognition.","The Labadie and Rush Island Energy Centers were honored as the best performers for 2011 by the Electric Utility Cost Group. This honor demonstrates that our commitment to performance, cost efficiency and reliability is benefiting our customers. In addition, our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center has been performing well, running continuously since its fall 2011 refueling outage.","Moving from earnings results and recent operation success, I would like to update you on regulatory matters at our utilities. Turning to page five of our presentation in Illinois regulatory matters.","As I previously mentioned in September of this year, we received a disappointing order from the ICC in response to our initial filing for formula electric delivery rates. In response we asked the ICC to rehear certain key issues in the rate order because we believe they misapplied the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Where the ICC denied our rehearing request last month and we have appeal the order to the States 4th District Appellate Court.","Unfortunately, this disappointing ICC order jeopardizes Ameren Illinois ability to implement advanced metering and other infrastructure improvements, and create jobs to the extent and on the timetable envision by the General Assembly.","Until the uncertainty surrounding how the Illinois law will ultimately being implemented is removed, Ameren Illinois is reducing its capital spending with corresponding negative effects on the job creation that the legislative -- legislature sought to achieve with the law.","Specifically, Ameren Illinois expects to reduce our deferral of total $30 million of previously planned 2013 electric distribution capital spending. Besides appealing the recent rate order to the court, Ameren Illinois is also reviewing potential legislative remedies to ensure that the goals of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act are realized.","Turning now to page six in Missouri regulatory matters. Our pending electric rate case is nearing a conclusion and our updated filings now support a $323 million annual increase. In this proceeding we are seeking recovery of costs and investments that we have already made to serve customers.","Further, we are asking the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve to enhancements to the existing regulatory framework in the state. First, we are requesting approval of storm cost tracking mechanism that will provide the opportunity to recover costs to restore service after major storms in a manner that is fair to both our customers and our investors.","Second, we are requesting approval of a new plant in-service accounting proposal. This proposal designed to reduce the impact of regulatory lag on earnings and future cash flows related to assets placed in service between rate cases.","Approval of this proposal would encourage prudent incremental discretionary investments in our energy infrastructure and help meet our customer\u2019s number one priority, reliability. Of course, these incremental investments would also help sustain and create new jobs.","The evidentiary hearings in front of the Missouri PSC were completed last month. The PSC plans to issue an order in early to mid-December of this year with new rates expected to be effective in early January of next year. As Marty will discuss in further detail the largest revenue related issue and dispute in this case the allowed rate of return on equity.","Moving to page seven, I will conclude my prepared comments on our Regulated Utility businesses by updating you on a key driver of our expected future growth a single largest plan investment, the Ameren Transmission Company Illinois River project.","This important MISO approved regional multi-value project involves construction of the new high-voltage transmission line across the State of Illinois. We will enhance reliability and create new construction jobs in the state.","Like all our Illinois transmission projects both those at Ameren Illinois Company and Ameren Transmission Company, the Illinois Rivers project will benefit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions constructive rate making. This rate making provide for annual formula based updating of rates and a competitive return on investment.","Further, last year, this project received FERC approval a constructive regulatory treatment, such as the inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base. I\u2019m pleased to report that just last month we completed 98 Stakeholder Public Meetings on the route design for this project.","And Wednesday of this week we filed with the ICC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the approximately 400-mile transmission line route, but the decision on this certificate reissued by July of next year.","Once receive the certificate from the ICC we will begin to acquire right of away for the transmission line. Preliminary construction may start as early as next year with the full range of construction activities expected in 2014.","Turning to page eight, in the discussion of our Merchant Generation business, continue to act to adjust this business to weak power prices in an uncertain timeline for their recovery.","Earlier this year, our Merchant Generation business filed the request for a variance in Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standards or MPS with the Illinois Pollution Control Board. In our petition, we outlined our need for additional time to comply with sulfur dioxide emissions standards which were to become effective June 1, 2015.","In exchange for delaying compliance with these standards until 2020, we propose an alternate compliance plan that restricted our sulfur dioxide emissions through 2014 to levels lower than those required by the existing MPS, thereby offsetting the environmental impact of granting the variance relief.","I\u2019m pleased to report that in September of this year the Pollution Control Board unanimously approved our variance request, subject to traditions that we have accepted.","As a result, through 2019 we do not expect to have to de-rate or shutdowns any of our currently operating energy centers in order to comply with the state sulfur dioxide emission limits.","Further, we have reduced our 2012 through 2016 Merchant Generation environmental capital spending plans by approximately $35 million, compared to our prior plans with 20 million of the reduction occurring this year. This reduction is primarily due to the vacated Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the impacts of the MPS variance. To be clear, these spending plans are sufficient to meet the milestone conditions through 2016 that were included in the variance.","That being said, we recognized that even with the relief granted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board, low power and capacity prices are impacting Ameren\u2019s earnings outlook. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce operating costs and enhance margins.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Tom. Turning to page 9 of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $1.54 per share, compared to third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded third quarter 2012 core earnings of $1.33 per share, compared with third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share.","Core earnings for the third quarter of 2012 excluded two items that are included in GAAP earnings. The largest of these non-core items was an increase in income tax benefit as a result of the first quarter 2012 non-cash asset impairment charge at our Merchant Generation business, and the GAAP requirement to recognize quarterly income tax expense using the annual estimated effective income tax rate.","This item increased net income by $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2012, entirely reversing the $0.18 per share decrease in income tax benefit recorded in the first half of 2012. We expect this item to have no impact on full-year 2012 earnings.","The second non-core item is a $0.03 per share gain from the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market activity. On page 10, we note key factors that drove the $0.24 per share decrease in third quarter 2012 core earnings, compared to third quarter 2011 core earnings.","Looking first at results of our regulated utilities, Ameren Illinois\u2019 September 2012 electric delivery rate order and the change in the quarterly distribution of revenues and earnings under formula ratemaking reduced core earnings by $0.12 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2011.","Moving to Ameren Missouri, electric sales margin reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower electric sales attributable to energy efficiency measures and customer conservation efforts.","While, we do estimate that warm third quarter 2012 temperatures benefited earnings by $0.10 per share as compared to normal temperatures, these temperatures did not materially impact the earnings comparison to the third quarter of 2011, because third quarter 2011 was similarly warm.","Ameren Missouri earnings were also impacted by higher effective income tax rate, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. The July 2011 Missouri electric rate adjustment partially offset the electric sales and tax rate impacts, benefitting earnings by $0.05 per share, compared to the third quarter 2011.","Finally, Merchant Generation Segment earnings were impacted by a $0.10 per share decline in margins, compared to the third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower power prices and higher fuel costs. This was partially offset by $0.05 per share of lower depreciation expense and $0.02 of lower plant operations and maintenance expense.","Turning now to page 11, we have updated our 2012 cash flow projection. We now expect 2012 negative free cash flow of approximately $205 million. The decrease in free cash flow of approximately $15 million, compared to the projection we provided on our August call.","Our negative free cash flow projection includes $138 million of premiums for long-term debt repurchases for our regulated utilities, Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri, which were paid during the third quarter. These premium payments were part of debt refinancing that reduced the weighted average interest rates on our utility debt and enhanced our debt maturity profile.","As a result, we expect to recover these premiums over the life of the newly issued debt through the regulatory process. As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our projected cash flows from operating activities, and subtracting from it expected capital expenditures, other cash flows for investing activities, dividends and net advances for construction.","Adjusting for the premiums paid on long-term debt, our adjusted free cash flow expectation is a negative, approximately $67 million. While we anticipate the 2012 free cash flow will be negative for Ameren as a whole, we expect that our Merchant Generation business will cover its own 2012 cash needs.","Moving from a discussion of earnings and cash flow, I would like to provide further details on the regulatory matters that Tom previously discussed. Turning to page 12 of our presentation, I will begin with the earnings impact of Illinois electric delivery formula ratemaking.","Under this ratemaking, reported Illinois electric delivery earnings for a given year reflected throughout for that year\u2019s rate base, actual cost of service and formula-based return on equity, as well as ICC ratemaking adjustment. Also, it is important to recognize that quarterly revenues and earnings are impacted by the timing and amount of operating costs.","As Tom previously mentioned, the ICC issued its order in our initial electric delivery formula rate case this September, and we\u2019ve incorporated the impacts of that order into the 2012 core earnings guidance that Tom shared with you. To assist you in thinking about 2012 Illinois electric delivery business earnings, we\u2019ve provided on this slide key inputs into the rate formula, including impacts of the recent ICC order.","Despite our belief that the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act calls for the use of year-end rate base and year-end capital structure, the ICC ordered the use of average rate base and the use of a hypothetical capital structure and we have reflected these ICC decisions in our guidance.","Also, our guidance now incorporates an estimated average 2012 30-year treasury bonds yield of 2.9%, down 10 basis points from the expectation we shared on our August call. Further, our guidance reflects the fact that several types of costs are not recoverable in rates, these non-recoverable costs include approximately $9 million of ICC ratemaking adjustments.","In addition, we expect to spend about $7.5 million this year on certain electric system rework that is non-recoverable in rates. And finally, approximately $9 million of the donations were required under the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Of this total, $7.5 million was a one-time 2012 only donation to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust.","Turning now to page 13, Ameren Illinois\u2019 first annual update case for electric delivery formula rates is nearing a conclusion. On Wednesday of this week, the ICC administrative law judges, hearing this case issued their proposed order.","While, we are still reviewing the proposed order, it appears to be in line with the order the ICC recently issued in the initial formula rate case. The deadline for an ICC decision in the update case is December 16th, with new rates scheduled to be effective in early January 2013.","Moving to page 6, the ICC is also currently reviewing Ameren Illinois\u2019 modified smart grid advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI deployment plan to determine if it is cost beneficial. We believe our filing strongly supports the cost beneficial nature of our plan. ","Installing smart grid equipment and advanced two-way electric meters is critical to meeting the infrastructure enhancements required under the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act that authorized formula rates. And such expenditures are a significant portion of the increase in capital spending required by the act.","The ICC is scheduled to rule on our modified plan this month. Assuming ICC approval, we plan to begin construction of infrastructure in the third quarter of 2013 with the first meters to be installed in the second quarter of 2014.","Turning to page 15 in our pending Missouri electric rate case, we have requested an updated $323 million annual rate increase, down from original request of $376 million. This changes the result of the normal rate case true-up process, a reduction in our requested return on equity to 10.5%, and the settlement of certain rate case issues.","Our updated request includes $73 million related to higher net fuel costs, $80 million already approved by the Missouri PSC related to recovery of costs for enhanced energy efficiency programs that will begin in 2013 and $170 million for other non-fuel costs.","In addition, we are seeking approval of a new storm cost tracking mechanism and a new plant in-service accounting proposal as Tom has already discussed. The Missouri PSC staff updated filing in this case supports a $210 million increase. The primary driver of the $113 million difference between Ameren Missouri\u2019s position and that of the staff has allowed return on equity.","The staff\u2019s 9% recommendation compared to our 10.5% request, accounts for $88 million of the difference. On this page, we also list other key drivers of the difference between our requests and the staff\u2019s positions. Regarding other rate case issues, the staff supported continuation of the Pension\/OPEB, vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism.","However, the staff called for changing the FAC sharing mechanism to an 85-15 split from the current 95-5 split. This proposed change in the sharing percentages is similar to what the staff has recommended in past rate cases. Further, the staff has recommended that transmission costs should no longer be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause, but instead should be recovered in base rates.","We opposed this potential change as we believe it is appropriate to recover transmission costs through the FAC. These costs can be volatile and are unavoidable and outside of management\u2019s control. Further, recovery through the FAC better matches the cost to be a member of MISO, with the benefit to customers received through off-system sales, which are included in the FAC.","If the PSC decides to make such a change, we believe a full cost tracking mechanism without any limiting conditions should be put in place to avoid regulatory lag, resulting from under recovery of cost increases between rate cases. Finally, the staff has recommended that the Missouri PSC reject our storm cost tracking mechanism and plant in-service accounting proposal.","In addition to the staff, other parties have filed testimony on several issues in the pending case. For example, Missouri industrial energy consumers and the Office of Public Counsel have recommended returns on equity of 9.3% and 8% respectively. The Missouri PSC is expected to issue its order in early to mid-December of this year, with new rates expected to be effective in early January 2013.","Shifting to our Merchant Generation business, on page 16, we provide updates on our 2012 through 2014 four power sales and hedges. As noted last quarter, as a result of falling power prices, which reduced economic generation levels in 2012, we hedged an amount greater than our ultimate expected generation. This hedging in excess of generation has been or will be settled on a profitable basis by either using purchase power or existing generation to the extent that power prices improve.","For 2013, we have now hedged approximately 24 million megawatt hours at an ever price of $36 per megawatt hour. Further for 2014, we have now hedged approximately 13 million megawatt hours at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour.","Finally, turning to page 17, an update of our Merchant Generation Business fuel and related transportation hedges. For 2013, we\u2019ve hedged approximately 22 million megawatt hours at about 2,350 per megawatt hour, unchanged from our August call. And for 2014, our hedges now totaled approximately 13 million megawatt hours at about $24 per megawatt hour.","Our reduced coal hedged level in 2014, reflects a rebalancing of our mix of cool hedges to reflect desired cool quantities and an amount overall matching our four power hedge position.","This completes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steven Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Tom Voss","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I was just curious. First, on your outlook for power prices, there\u2019s sort of an ongoing debate about the impact of upcoming environmental regulations on the price of power and weather. The four price of power is really fully accounting for all those environmental costs, particularly post election the questions are coming up a lot? I was just curious, as you think about the Midwest and the amount of potential economic retirements that we are seeing out there. And as you look at the four power markets, do you have any general comments on what you\u2019re seeing out there?","Martin Lyons","Yeah. Steven, I mean it\u2019s a good question. I think it\u2019s always been. This is Marty by the way. It\u2019s always difficult to speculate on what\u2019s going to happen with forward power prices. I mean, our view, I think along with others is that forward power prices today are obviously pretty low, certainly, reflecting the continued weak economy and the low gas prices.","We do expect that over time, especially when you look out to the MATS rules that take effect out in 2015-2016 timeframe that you will see the need for folks to either make additional expenditures or for higher cost generation to shut down. I think, MISO has estimated as much as 12,000 megawatt hours of production across the MISO footprints. So those types of things will certainly, I think, over time put pressure on capacity prices, if not power prices.","Steven Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thank you. And so related question, just as you think about the merchant business, you\u2019ve laid out for 2012. The business is able to fully fund itself. It\u2019s not cash-flow negative. As you think about the outlook for that business, from a strategic point of view, is there a sense that through strategic activity, cost cutting could be achieved, greater scale could be achieved. And is there a view that greater skill is needed in general in the merchant generation business or just -- if you won\u2019t mind just giving an update on how you think about strategically your merchant business?","Martin Lyons","Stephen, I think a couple of things. First of all, you talked about the cash flows. And I think as we said in the call, certainly we\u2019re expecting the business to cover its cash needs this year. From time-to-time, we get questions about Genco, in particular. They started the year out with about $82 million of cash and advances to the money pool as of September 30th. They still had about $57 million of cash and advances to the money pool combined by $57 million.","And as you know, have the ability to sell gas-fired assets or exercise put option to -- for liquidity purposes. So those options are out there as well as they certainly expect going forward. They have the benefit of certain net operating losses that they\u2019ve got as well. So there are some tools in the toolkit in terms of liquidity and cash flows in the short term.","Longer term, strategically, I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate -- obviously I think the larger scale platforms that are out there. There are certain synergies that you can have. I think as we\u2019ve managed this business over time, we certainly gotten some synergies by the overall combination of the entities that we have. But going forward, it\u2019s something that we will continue to consider the nature of our overall hybrid mix.","Steven Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Tom Voss","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just quickly on whether, it sounds like there were $0.10 above normal for the quarter, I believe. Could you give us a sense as to what the weather-normalized growth is for the quarter and year-to-date in Illinois and Missouri. And whether or not, you\u2019re seeing any decrease in weather-normalized sales, particularly, excuse me, in Missouri and the potential for regulatory lag in that jurisdiction. We heard something today that that might indicate that\u2019s a potential with another company?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. I don\u2019t know about the other company, you\u2019re referring to Paul, but -- certainly, this is Marty. Again, I can certainly comment overall. We did estimate about $0.10 per share of positive impact from weather in the third quarter versus normal.","And we also mentioned in our prepared remarks that overall, we thought Missouri electric sales negatively impacted earnings by about $0.04 versus last year. And that\u2019s the case with $0.10 versus normal positive weather impact in the quarter.","As we looked at the weather this year versus last year, we thought the impact was about flattish or no impact. You may recall that we had a warm summer last year. It was kind of a persistent warm summer whereas this year we have some heat in June, extreme heat in July and then it kind of, dropped off to more normal conditions for the remainder.","What we saw this year is that as we have those extremes in heat and we quantified as I said the impact to be about $0.10, when we looked at the weather normalized sales, they were actually down. And so when you look at the statistics page we provided, you\u2019ll actually see that residential and commercial sales were down year-over-year.","And again remember, that we believe that overall weather was about flat. So those sales declines which you are seeing are sort of weather-normalized sales decline. Now, as we know weather normalization is somewhat art and somewhat science. So that\u2019s why we say in particular talking point of some of that reduction in overall weather-normalized loads maybe because of customer conservation efforts as they receive some of the higher bills from the June and July timeframe.","But getting back to your question, I mean, that\u2019s in Missouri for the quarter was in Missouri residential sales on a weather normalized basis down between 1.5% to 2%, same kind of pattern in the commercial sector.","In Illinois, we saw a little bit greater decline in residential usage and the commercial was actually a slight positive. So overall, for Ameren, in the quarter what we saw on a weather-normalized basis was residential sales down a little over 2%, commercial sales down between 0.5% and 1%. So we saw some -- again some weather normalized declines in the quarter and again how much of that may have been a reaction to the extreme weather in some of the bills people received is difficult to know.","We expected coming into the year to have about residential, commercial sales about 0.5% to 1% of growth. What we\u2019re now expecting for the year, Paul, is that residential sales to be down somewhere around 0.5% for the year, still expecting to see some commercial growth, however, up to 0.5%.","I think on industrial side, we\u2019re seeing pretty flat loads in terms of industrial sales in Missouri. While we\u2019re still seeing some growth in Illinois, we\u2019re seeing growth year-to-date in Illinois of about 3.9% and we\u2019re expecting for the year all across Ameren to have growth of about 2.7%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","That means, in terms of regulatory lag and going forward, I mean with the conservation efforts that we\u2019ve seen actually around the country for a while now, or whatever it is, least usage. How should we think, is your potential for regulatory lag in Missouri that you guys are -- or did not, I guess, and this really briefly on the merchant, depreciation went down about $0.05. Was that because of Duck Creek or was it anything else?","Marty Lyons","Let me have that one and then maybe I actually got Warner Baxter talk about Missouri but yeah, you may look back. When you look back to our beginning of the year guidance compared to now. Our actual guidance today is about $0.05 higher than it was at the beginning of the year. And in part that is because of the Duck Creek write-off which then positively impacted depreciation and that\u2019s about $0.05 for the year. So that is part of that, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","It looks like it was $0.05 for the quarter though.","Marty Lyons","Yeah. We also, I think the other thing that we did in the quarter that you\u2019ll see in the 10-Q is we actually did adjust some of our asset retirement obligations for certain ash pond closures and that had a little bit of an impact as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay.","Warner Baxter","And Paul, this is Warner. Just a couple of things to keep in mind, number one with regard to these lower sales. Be mindful, that we\u2019re in the mindful of our current rate case. So consequently, we update our billing units for the lower sales levels.","And so those were done through June. And so a piece of the things that you\u2019re seeing at least throughout 2012 are part of our overall rate increase request that you see today. But secondly -- but you have to be mindful of is that as we go forward, I think Marty mentioned during the talking points that that we had a new energy efficiency regulatory framework that\u2019s been put in place.","So we\u2019re going to be moving on in some additional energy efficiency programs which obviously going to be beneficial for our customers but also as part of that, we\u2019re going to now recover our program costs but also will be able to recover the loss fixed costs or the loss revenues associated with some of those. That\u2019s part of the existing rate case as well and frankly, a settlement that the commission is already approved.","And so I think there is still risk to be clear for regulatory lag associated with conservation efforts. We have taken steps with this rate case and with our new energy efficiency proposal to try and mitigate that to some extent.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","I\u2019ll let other people ask question. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul, you line is live","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Voss","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","First, quick question on the quarter with regard to Illinois to $0.012. Could you break that apart in terms of the distribution versus the quarterly shift, versus the earnings under the rate making?","Tom Voss","Well, I guess, we\u2019ll break it down this way, Julien. I think about the -- I attribute about $0.05 of that total of the 12 to the impacts of the rate order that we received. And the remainder of it really having to do with the distribution of revenues and earnings?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And so next year, should we see this more normalized given the fact that the rate making has been in effect for the balance of this year. So this will kind of go away year-on-year?","Tom Voss","Yeah. I think it should normalize year-over-year. And I think what we\u2019ll do is we move into next year to see whether we can, if there is any variation that we can foresee and project, we\u2019ll certainly provide that. But certainly, what it has to do with is, this year, what we\u2019re trying to do under the formula rate making is preserve some of the seasonality of the revenue requirement.","But as you go through the year and there are changes in the estimated overall revenue requirement for the year than those are adjusted within the quarter, which is one of the things that impacted us here in this quarter.","I think Julien, in terms of the drivers on our slide 12, drivers have overall electric DS earnings, we try to lay out some of the overall drivers as we see them right now, given the impacts of the ICC order.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Quick follow-up there, you discussed lower CapEx in Illinois, I believe for \u201813. Can you, kind of, provide a little bit of a sense on a go-forward basis. What kind of capital expenditure reductions we could potentially see depending on what happens upon re-hearing et cetera. Where could this go ultimately?","Marty Lyons","Well, I think there is something that we\u2019ll have to evaluate over time. Obviously, we gave the 2013 number. What impactor is on 2014 or beyond is something that we have to evaluate as we move through time. Our focus right now as you heard in our talking points is trying to get the legislative intent and corporate it into the rate making process.","We still do believe that over the long-term, they formulate a great model attended by the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. It is good for Ameren Illinois and its customers and so we\u2019re certainly appealing the decision of the ICC to the courts. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, again considering what legislative remedies might be possible.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","But just to be clear, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact any of your commitments under the formula rate making?","Marty Lyons","That\u2019s true, we\u2019ve made commitments under the formula ratemaking and so we look at our capital ventures, so certainly to the extent we\u2019re participating in the formula ratemaking. We will fulfill our commitments under the law.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys. Just curious what are -- how you -- when you think how structurally across both the Missouri and Illinois regulated businesses, what are the structural impediments to earning your authorized rate of return. Which ones tend to be kind of the biggest drivers that keep you from being able to do so?","Marty Lyons","","Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Michael, this is Marty, again. I think let\u2019s start with Illinois. I think when you look at the slide that we provided, slide 12. You see some of those impacts as it relates to the Illinois electric delivery business in terms of ratemaking adjustments at certain costs that are incurred that are non-recoverable, which we\u2019ve laid out again for the electric distribution business thereon on slide 12.","Other things I remind for instance as weather sometimes. I mean, for example on our gas business this year in Illinois, earnings are down roughly $0.03 because of weather. So that type of thing can certainly drive it down. And then I think Michael, I think you and others have this baked into your overall analysis in Illinois. But I just remind you that the goodwill in Illinois is deducted out for ratemaking purposes, against the equity in that overall business. So and that\u2019s always been the case that\u2019s not something that\u2019s new, that\u2019s historical ratemaking adjustment. But again, I\u2019d remind you of that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Tai with Standard General. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Tai - Standard General","Hi, guys. How you are doing?","Marty Lyons","Good morning.","Alex Tai - Standard General","I just had a question on -- and I believe you commented on just previously, but I just, we can get more specific on in terms of -- and you said previously that you would be able to comply with [mac] without undertaking scrubbing program for Newton in your merchant gene segment and obviously that\u2019s sort of irrespective of the deep variances recently granted.","I was just wondering, maybe you could provide a little bit more detail on how you think you can there in terms of compliance and is that sort of baked within your current CapEx plan?","Marty Lyons","Sure. Yeah. This is Marty again, you are correct on all that. I mean that is consistent with what we said in the past. One of the reasons that we were pursuing the variance from the Multi-Pollutant Standard with the Illinois Pollution Control Board was in fact that we were able to comply with the match rules without that scrubber. And it was really these Illinois rules that were imposing the need to construct that scrubber.","So, we do believe that the capital expenditure plans that we\u2019ve laid out, will -- while as to comply with MATS. And it\u2019s really a function of a number of things. It\u2019s a function of the investments that we\u2019ve already made in our plans overtime. We\u2019ve made significant investments in pollution control equipment.","We also burned low sulfur coal, which helps with our overall missions. And as a result of compliance with the Multi-Pollutant Standard Illinois we are already using significant amounts of activated carbon for control of mercury. So, through the -- I\u2019d say the compliance with the Multi-Pollutant Standard, we\u2019ve actually built into our operations of those things that are needed to comply with the MATS rules.","Alex Tai - Standard General","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Marty, I just wanted to reconfirm what you\u2019re saying -- as you look from \u201812 to \u201813, is this $0.12 recovered or is this just lost and there\u2019s no positive delta year-over-year?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. It\u2019s not really the $0.12 year-over-year. I think that what is more permanent, I would say until we get either of some fixed to the ICC ratemaking to conform with the act or otherwise adjust our spending or capital structure. I guess what I am saying to that point you back to slide 12 again. I think those are really the drivers of the earnings and as I said earlier the $0.12 when you break it down was really $0.05 having to do with the ICC rate order, and then remainder just really been seasonality of the revenue requirement earnings under formula ratemaking.","We try the provide on slide 12 though we are more -- it was more a straightforward build up or provide you with a straightforward building blocks to build up to the revenue requirement as we see it today, given the ICCs rate order.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Okay. Okay. Thanks.","Marty Lyons","Yeah, Ashar. Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones on the Genco side of the house real quickly. In terms of the fuel hedge I notice that the 14 number actually kind of stepped up by $0.50 there. I think, it\u2019s little less than we\u2019ve been intuitive given some of the recent trends to just be curious?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. Julien, that\u2019s right. And so in our prepared remarks, we tried to provide a comment on this. What we did do in the quarter was rebalance our mix of coal hedges a little bit and then rebalancing of the coal hedges actually impacted the average price a little bit.","As you see in that too, you might notice that the coal hedge present -- the coal hedge number dropdown from about $14 million megawatthours to $13, which also aligns with the forward power sales that we\u2019ve made about $13 million megawatthours. So, it was a bit of rebalancing of the coal hedge mix. Yet remember, these are -- we round off to the nearest $0.50. So there is a little bit of rounding in there that coal hedge rebalancing wasn\u2019t a full $0.50 sort of impact and -- but that was I\u2019d say one of the drivers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And then the second question here, I mean, obviously you talked about free cash flow break-even for Genco. I\u2019ll be curious, how do you think about execution of the put options specifically your queue alludes to losing access to some of your other sources of liquidity at some point. Would you imagine execution that we put in tandem with some of the other liquidity source losses, do you get what I am saying?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. I know you would necessarily be in tandem with the other liquidity source losses. Like I said, they still as we figured well at 9\/30, they had about $57 million of both cash and the money pool advances on the balance sheet. So, we will be thinking about that as we look at the overall cash flows going into next year and the year beyond what the available cash is, as they again seek to cover their own cash needs. And then making a decision about what the right course of action is in terms of execution of that option.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Right. So effectively to be clear, once you roll off of the existing cash balances at that point you will probably take a look at execution.","Marty Lyons","Well, that\u2019s right. To the extent that the cash balances roll down and if we were in a position where we didn\u2019t see the ability for them to meet their own cash needs certainly then would be in a position where we would be executing the put option. But again, right now, I mentioned sort of the overall liquidity that they\u2019ve got.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Right. Absolutely, and just to be clearly also, if you would execute the put option, if you would you expect to sell those assets in turn, do you kind of -- would this be a transition or anything or would you effectively intend to keep those new assets at the new subsidiary?","Marty Lyons","Well, I guess only the end of the day we have the option to do either, but certainly the idea was that if Genco exercise to put, obviously they get $100 immediately. They get the remainder of any excess to the fair value over the $100 million as determined by the appraisals at closing. And then AERG, we would actually then have those assets, we\u2019ll have the ability to -- so one or all of those in order to reduce outstanding borrowings resulting from the put.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Right. Fantastic.","Marty Lyons","Yeah. Exactly.","Operator","Our next follow-up question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul, your line is live.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Sorry about that. Can you hear me.","Marty Lyons","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","The ash pound ARO is that just for the quarter or is there an ongoing impact associated with that?","Marty Lyons","No. It just for the quarter. We periodically actually update our estimates. These ones in particular that had to do with Meredosia and Hutsonville and some of the closure there. As we are working through the closure of those facilities and had better estimates on the overall cost, it\u2019s really one-time kind of impact.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","The severe weather that you mentioned in the release. I gather that and also in your comments that\u2019s this hot weather that you guys incurred in the summer, were there any new peak this summer, just in terms of I know what you gave us sort of megawatthour declines but was there any how to peak -- how was peak compared to megawatthour volume if you follow me?","Marty Lyons","I think we comment on some of the peaks. Actually, last quarter but I will let maybe Maureen Borkowski talk about the overall system peak \u2026","Maureen Borkowski","Yeah. From our systems standpoint, we did set a new all time peak. Being at 2008, I believe was a previous all time. Within the two individual systems either Ameren Illinois or Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois set a new peak but Ameren Missouri did not exceed it\u2019s all time peak.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just finally, given this outlook that we\u2019ve seen around the country and the memories to serve the gas industry LBCs and how we took some to come around to decoupling just any thoughts there about way to sort of mitigate the potential issue that we might be seeing here. Also considering that it seems the Missouri seems to have and other jurisdictions around the country, Warner have conservation what have you any thoughts about decoupling or how should we think about that and how you guys approaching that kind of issue?","Warner Baxter","Hi, Paul. This is Warner. I can speak from Missouri. Certainly, we don\u2019t rule decoupling out and in fact other than discussions at decommission as to whether decoupling is an approach forward. And so there is no formal docket on that but that\u2019s certainly one thing we look. But in part, that\u2019s why we took the steps that we did and we\u2019re able to achieve a meaningful enhancement for energy efficiency that was a meaningful stuff change.","Because absent that those energy efficiency programs really could not move forward. And so you look at decoupling you may look at other regulatory mechanisms that would try and address energy efficiency issues or conservation issues. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s imminent, but it\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s on our list of things that we have to continue to look at. As you right for the point out the environment changes a bit from what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Ultimately, what we are pushing from trying to do in Missouri and certainly Illinois is we can promote economic development to try and get growth not just from our residential, commercial but also to get investment made in the state. So, we can put people back to work and actually get electric sales growth from that perspective as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Great.","Marty Lyons","This is Marty. Couple of other things, I mean, just a reminder, in Illinois of course with the formula rates, I mean one of the benefits is that we do have the formula rates and there is a caller on the overall earned ROE or the lot of ROE plus or minus 50% basis points. So certainly, there is a provision within that overall formulaic rates that\u2019s certainly helpful.","The other thing know is well -- this year again, I think maybe because of some of the weather we\u2019re certainly seen more flattish residential and commercial loads. Like I said, we are still seeing industrial loads growing in Illinois. And as we look at overtime, we do expect to see some level of GDP growth overtime and with it even after the impact of energy efficiency, do you still expect to see growth and electric demand and maybe a less than what we\u2019ve historically seen but nonetheless expect to see growth in the electric demand as a company anyway going forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Did you have any ratio associated with GDP that you can share with us that you are expecting in terms of that, I mean in terms of what percent I mean if you have 2% GDP growth what that would translate in terms of the electric growth, do you guys have this estimation or?","Marty Lyons","Yeah. I don\u2019t have it in my finger tips\u2026","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay.","Marty Lyons","Updated one but like I said I think overall we certainly are expecting net of energy efficiency that relationship, that ratio to be less than that historically has been, but nonetheless they are all positive.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay.

Marty will follow with more detailed discussions of first quarter 2012 financial results as well as regulatory and other financial matters.  We will then open the call for questions.","Here is Tom, who will start on Page 3 of the presentation.","Thomas Voss","Thanks, Doug.  Good morning and thank you for joining us.  Today we announced a first quarter 2012 net loss in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, of $1.66 per share compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $0.29 per share.  This first quarter 2012 GAAP net loss included a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of $628 million related to the write-down of our Duck Creek merchant generation energy center which was triggered by the first quarter 2012 sharp decline in forward prices for electricity.  Excluding the impacts of this charge, a related tax adjustment and mark-to-market activity, first quarter 2012 core results were positive with earnings of $0.22 per share compared to first quarter 2011 core earnings of $0.25 per share.  The decrease in first quarter 2012 core earnings compared to first quarter 2011 core earnings primarily reflected the impact of warm winter weather on our regulated utility electric and natural gas sales.","First quarter 2012 winter temperatures were among the warmest on record with heating degree days approximately 30% fewer than those experienced in the year-ago quarter.  As a result, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to weather-sensitive residential and commercial utility customers declined 9%.  Natural gas sales were also negatively impacted by the much warmer weather with first quarter 2012 volumes down 21% compared to the first quarter of 2011.  In total, we estimate that warmer temperatures reduced first quarter 2012 earnings by $0.13 per share compared to the first quarter of 2011, and by $0.10 per share compared to normal.","On a positive note, kilowatt hour sales to industrial customers rose 5% compared to the first quarter of 2011, a sign of economic improvement in our region.  A second key driver of lower first quarter 2012 core earnings compared to the year-ago quarter was reduced margins in the merchant generation segment.  The decreased margins reflected reduced generation to the merchant segment due to lower market prices for electricity.","The effects of the warm weather and lower merchant margins were partially offset by increased electric utility rates in Missouri, increased natural gas delivery rates in Illinois, and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, including reduced storm-related costs.","Turning now to Page 4, today we are affirming our core earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share for this year.  The much warmer than normal weather led us to reduce core guidance for our regulated utility business by $0.05 per share at both the high and low ends of the range to $2.15 to $2.35 per share.  This reduction in earnings guidance for the utilities is offset by an increase in the core guidance range for our merchant generation business segment of $0.05 per share at both the high and low ends of the range to $0.05 to $0.15 per share.  The increase in merchant generation guidance primarily reflects lower expected depreciation expense due to the write-down of the Duck Creek energy center.","I would now like review some of our business plans and some recent business developments at our regulated and merchant generation businesses.  Moving to Page 5 and our strategy for regulated businesses, we continue to believe that modern, constructive regulatory frameworks which provide timely cash flows and a reasonable opportunity to earn fair returns on investments are clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers in the states in which we operate.  These frameworks support our ability to attract capital on terms which facilitate timely investment in order to modernize our regulated companies\u2019 aging infrastructure.  Such investments enhance reliability and the quality of service we can deliver to our customers and also help create good paying jobs.","Further, these investments help us meet our customers\u2019 and states\u2019 energy needs and expectations which ultimately drive higher levels of customer satisfaction.  Constructive formula ratemaking is in place for both our Ameren Illinois electric delivery service and our FERC-regulated electric transmission business.  As a result, we are able to move forward with plans to invest meaningful incremental capital in these businesses.","Over the next 10 years, our Illinois electric delivery business plans to invest $625 million over and above levels we have been spending in recent years and create 450 jobs during the peak program year.  The improved infrastructure resulting from this investment will enhance reliability and provide customers with the energy usage options made possible by smart meters.  ","At our electric transmission businesses, the need to replace aging infrastructure and improve the capacity of the high-voltage highway in our region, coupled with the constructive formula ratemaking utilized by the FERC, are driving our plans to invest approximately $1.7 billion in transmission projects over a five-year period ending in 2016.  I am pleased to report two recent positive developments related to these transmission growth plans.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved forward test year rate treatment for Ameren Transmission Company, or ATX, effective March 1, 2012; and on May 1, we began our public participation process on route design for ATX\u2019s $800 million-plus Illinois Rivers project, a MISO multi-value regional line.  This process is required prior to our filing for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the project with the ICC, a filing we plan to make in the fourth quarter of this year.","In Missouri, however, we continue to see the need to enhance the existing regulatory framework to support investments in our aging infrastructure and to meet our customers\u2019 rising expectations, as well as to provide our company timely cash flows and a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on those investments.  One approach we are pursuing is through the regulatory process.  In particular, we\u2019ve made several proposals in our pending electric rate case designed to enhance the existing framework.  First, we are seeking approval of a storm cost tracking mechanism that would provide the opportunity to recover costs to restore service after major storms in a manner that is fair to both our customers and our investors.  Second, we are seeking approval of a new plant-in-service accounting proposal.  This proposal is designed to reduce the impact of regulatory lag on earnings and future cash flows related to assets placed in service between cases.  And finally, in January we made a filing under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEEIA, and requested an enhancement to the existing regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs and the related throughput disincentives that result from these programs.  In the interim, we continue to better align the level of our spending with the monies provided through the existing regulatory process as well as with economic conditions.","In summary, if our utilities have modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in place, we will be able to increase investment to modernize aging infrastructure, allowing us to better meet customers\u2019 expectations for higher quality service and create good paying jobs for our local economy.  That is why we are allocating increasing amounts of capital to Illinois electric delivery service and FERC-regulated transmission projects.  On Page 6, we illustrate our plans to allocate increasing amounts of investment dollars to these two businesses in the five-year period ending in 2016, compared to the prior five-year period ending in 2015.  As you can see, we have increased our spending plans for the Illinois regulated electric and gas delivery services by approximately $400 million from the prior five-year period, primarily reflecting the increased spending on electric delivery service that I mentioned a few moments ago.  We have increased our spending plans for transmission by approximately $500 million from the prior five-year period; meanwhile, our spending plans for the Missouri electric utility business for the five years ending in 2016 are essentially flat.","I want to be clear that I recognize that in all circumstances, it is our obligation to provide safe and adequate service to our customers, and we have certain minimum expenditures we must make.  Those investments have been and will continue to be made.","Turning to Page 7, here we translate the capital spending plans we just discussed into regulated rate base.  We expect growth of approximately 6% annually over the 2012 to 2016 period.  Further, this growth is skewed toward regulatory jurisdictions with constructive formula ratemaking.  We believe this will enhance our ability to earn fair returns on our utility investments.","Moving to Page 8, as we are taking steps today to address our aging infrastructure, keep our service reliable and our rates competitive, we are also looking to the future to be sure that our company is well positioned to meet our customers\u2019 and our states\u2019 long-term energy needs.  In light of our aging coal fleet along with continued uncertainties with environmental regulations and commodity prices, we believe it is prudent to maintain effective resource options for the future.  As a result, we announced just a couple weeks ago that Ameren Missouri has entered into agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company, a world leader in nuclear technology and development.  Under our agreement, we will exclusively support Westinghouse\u2019s application to the Department of Energy for funds to support the design and commercialization of American-made small modular reactors for the United States and for the rest of the world.  This agreement is consistent with our commitment to maintain nuclear energy as an important option to meet Missouri\u2019s future energy needs.","In addition, it presents Missouri with significant economic development and job creation opportunities.  In essence, Missouri could ultimately become the hub for the design, development and manufacture of American-made small modular nuclear reactors.  Our alliance with Westinghouse has broad statewide support, including every electric utility provider in the state, Governor Nixon, a bipartisan group of federal and state legislative leaders, labor, businesses, universities, and others.  The potential DOE funding when combined with our investment to date in new nuclear development and our agreement with Westinghouse provides Ameren Missouri with the opportunity to obtain a nuclear combined construction and operating license, or COL, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small modular reactor at the Callaway site with minimal incremental investment.  Obtaining a COL would preserve an important energy option for Ameren Missouri and its customers and be a viable long-term asset.","Pursuing and obtaining a COL does not obligate our company to build a nuclear plant, but it does preserve an important energy option and positions Missouri to move forward in a timely fashion should conditions be right to build a small modular reactor in the future.  The grant application will be submitted this month and we expect the Department of Energy to make their decision later this summer.","Turning to Page 9, I will conclude my prepared remarks with an update on our merchant generation business.  We have sold forward or hedged all of our expected 2012 merchant generation output at prices above current market levels.  As a result, we continue to expect our merchant generation segment to be free cash flow positive this year and for Ameren Energy Generating Company, or Genco, to provide for its own cash needs with the benefit of existing money pool receivables.  However, as we look beyond 2012, we cannot ignore the potential negative impact of low energy and capacity prices on our cash flows.  As you are aware, in early 2012 there was a sharp decline in forward power prices.  In response, in February we announced an approximately $270 million reduction in capital spending plans for our merchant generation business for the years 2012 through 2014.  In the first quarter, decline in power prices also led to the write-down of our Duck Creek energy center, which I mentioned earlier.  More recently, we have taken several additional actions to better position our merchant generation business to weather the current period of very low power prices.","In late March, Genco entered into a put option agreement with an affiliate.  The agreement provides Genco with an additional source of liquidity if such liquidity is needed in the future.  It remains our goal for the merchant generation business segment and Genco to provide for their own cash needs.","In a second recent action, just yesterday, our merchant generation business filed a request for a variance from the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard, or MPS, with the Illinois Pollution Control Board.  In our petition, we are seeking additional time to comply with sulfur dioxide emission levels, currently set to become effective January 1, 2015.  In exchange for delaying compliance with these levels through 2020, we have proposed a plan that restricts our sulfur dioxide emissions through 2014 to levels lower than those required by the existing MPS, offsetting any environmental impact from the variance.  We have indicated to the Pollution Control Board that if we are not granted the variance, or power prices do not materially increase, there is a significant risk that we\u2019ll have to mothball some of our unscrubbed merchant generation coal-fired energy centers beginning in 2015.  The Pollution Control Board is expected to rule on our request by late summer 2012.","Now I will turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Lyons","Thanks, Tom.  Turning to Page 10 of the presentation, today we reported a first quarter 2012 GAAP loss of $1.66 per share compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded first quarter 2012 core earnings of $0.22 per share compared with first quarter 2011 core earnings of $0.25 per share.","First quarter 2012 core earnings excluded three items that are included in GAAP earnings.  The largest of these non-core items was the non-cash asset impairment charge in our merchant generation business that Tom mentioned earlier.  The triggering event for this impairment was the sharp decline in power prices which occurred during the first quarter of 2012.  Specifically, we recognized a $628 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our Duck Creek energy center to its estimated fair value.  This reduced earnings by $1.55 per share.  ","The second non-core item was a non-cash quarterly reduction in the income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the Duck Creek asset impairment.  This reduction in income tax benefit was the result of a combination of seasonally low first quarter earnings with the GAAP requirement to recognize income tax expense using the annual estimated effective income tax rate.  This item decreased net income by $0.36 per share in the first quarter of 2012 and is projected to fully reverse over the balance of this year.  I note that the effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 24% on a GAAP basis while on a core basis we continue to expect a 2012 rate of approximately 36%.","The last non-core item is a $0.03 per share gain from the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market activity.  On Page 11, we highlight key factors driving the variance between core earnings per share for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011.  Key factors adversely affecting the comparison included a decline in margins at our regulated utilities of $0.14 per share after excluding rate changes.  We estimate that $0.13 of this $0.14 decline in utility margins was due to lower retail sales as a result of the near-record warm winter temperatures.  The decline in margins at the merchant generation business reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting reduced generation levels due to low spot market prices for energy and higher per megawatt hour fuel and transportation-related expenses.","The reduction in first quarter 2012 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2011 also reflected a one-time contribution to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust related to Ameren Illinois Company\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s electric delivery formula ratemaking framework.  This $7.5 million pre-tax contribution, which is not recoverable in rates, reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.","Key factors favorably impacting the comparison of first quarter 2012 core earnings to the first quarter 2011 core earnings included changes in electric and gas rates net of certain related expenses, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share.  These rates changes included an electric rate increase in Missouri effective in late July 2011 and a gas delivery rate increase in Illinois effective in January 2012.  A second factor favorably impacting the earnings comparison was the recognition of revenue related to the Illinois electric delivery formula ratemaking.  In the first quarter of 2012, Ameren Illinois recorded a regulatory asset of $12 million with a corresponding increase in electric revenues.  The revenue recognized represents our estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected in order to recover first quarter operating costs and in formulaic returns on Illinois electric delivery investments.","We will continue to adjust revenues in the associated regulatory asset over the remainder of the year such that at the end of the year, these amounts represent Ameren Illinois\u2019 estimate of future cash flows expected to be approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission through the annual formula rate update process.  I\u2019ll discuss this process more in a moment.","The final positive factor I would like to mention is lower core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses which benefited the earnings comparison by $0.09 per share with $0.05 of this due to lower storm-related costs.  ","Turning now to Page 12, today we are also affirming our 2012 cash flow guidance.  As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our projected cash flows from operating activities and subtracting from it expected capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends, and net advances for construction.  For 2012, we continue to anticipate that free cash flow will be negative by approximately $230 million; however, as Tom stated, we are also continuing to expect that our merchant generation business will be free cash flow positive.  ","Turning now to Page 13 and back to a discussion of Illinois formula ratemaking \u2013 since January of this year, we have made a series of regulatory filings required by law based on Ameren Illinois\u2019 election to participate in Illinois\u2019 new performance-based formula ratemaking process for electric delivery service.  While the results of certain of these filings, which I will discuss in a minute, will establish the level of rates charged to customers in late 2012 and 2013, I want to emphasize that full-year 2012 Illinois electric delivery earnings will reflect a true-up for 2012 rate base and actual cost of service, and include historical ICC ratemaking adjustments.  The same will be true in 2013.","The return on equity recognized in 2012 will be based on the 2012 12-month average of 30-year treasury yields plus 590 basis points, with a plus or minus 50 basis point collar.  To the extent that revenues and regulatory assets are recognized in 2012 in accordance with our formula ratemaking expectations, they will be subject to ICC review and recovery will occur in 2014, as shown on the timeline.","Moving now to Page 14, Ameren Illinois\u2019 January initial filing under the performance-based formula ratemaking framework for electric delivery service was based on 2010 actual costs and 2011 and 2012 expected net plant additions.  The filing called for a $19 million annual rate decrease.  In April, the ICC staff and other intervenors filed their direct testimony in this case.  The ICC staff has recommended that rates be decreased by $6 million annually more than Ameren Illinois has proposed.  This variance between our request and the staff\u2019s recommendation primarily reflects a lower calculation of 2010 capitalization, primarily lower 2010 average common equity.  ","On Page 15, we have summarized the positions of the other major intervenors in the case.  The revenue requirement recommended by these parties range from 24 to $37 million lower than our filing with 14 to $22 million of this difference reflecting the incorporation of estimated 2011 and 2012 accumulated deferred income taxes, which are direct reductions to rate base  Since rates and earnings will be trued up for actual rate base, these adjustments for accumulated deferred income taxes are not expected to impact our reported earnings; however, we and the intervenors in this case do have different views on another issue related to the rate base amount to be used in the eventual true-up calculation.  We argue that the legislation specifies that the true-up for a given year should be based on actual rate base at the end of the year.  The ICC staff and other intervenors recommend that the ICC use average rate base for that year for the true-up.","In an unrelated matter, the Attorney General has recommended an additional $7 million revenue reduction by crediting Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric delivery cost to service with the benefit of the full amount of electric late payment revenue, including the over 50% related to power supply, rather than just the portion related to delivery service.","Finally, the Illinois industrial energy customers are recommending limiting the common equity ratio to 50% rather than the amount in our filing.  We strongly believe that the rate formula does not permit such a limitation of the equity ratio and thus consider this proposed adjustment unjustified.  The ICC administrative law judge are expected to issue their proposed order in this case in August with an ICC decision expected in late September and new rates to be effective in late October, 2012.","Turning to Page 16, in April Ameren Illinois made its initial annual electric delivery formula rate update filing.  This filing calls for an incremental $15 million annual rate decrease compared to the rates filed in January and is based on 2011 actual costs and 2012 expected net plant additions.  The rate filing calls for a reduction in rates beyond those filed in January primarily because of lower rate base and return on equity.  The $128 million lower rate base in this filing compared to the January filing reflects the incorporation of 2011 accumulated deferred income taxes, including bonus depreciation.  ","Under the formula rate template, accumulated deferred income taxes for the prior year \u2013 in this case, 2011 \u2013 are not incorporated into rate base estimate until the spring update rate filing each year.  However, once again it is important to understand that the earnings for a given year will be trued up to that year\u2019s actual rate base, which will include the deduction for actual accumulated deferred income taxes for that given year.  The electric delivery rates established in this case will be effective in January 2013.","On these next two pages, 17 and 18, we remind you of the highlights of the pending Missouri electric rate case.  At the bottom of Page 18 are the key dates in the rate case schedule.   The Missouri Public Service Commission staff and other intervenors are required to file direct testimony on revenue requirements by July 6 and a PSC order is expected in December 2012, with new rates expected to be effective in January 2013.","Moving now to Page 19, here we provide an update of our 2012 through 2014 forward power sales and hedges for our merchant generation business.  Before we move to the updated hedge numbers, at the top of the page we indicate that expected 2012 merchant generation is approximately 25.5 million megawatt hours as of the end of the first quarter.  This is down approximately 1.5 million megawatt hours from the estimate we shared with you on our February call and reflects our expectation that we will more aggressively cycle our base load generation stations in order to improve overall margins in this weak power price environment.  ","You will also note that for 2012, we have hedged an amount greater than our expected generation \u2013 approximately 27.5 million megawatt hours.  This amount is hedged at an average price of $43 per megawatt hour.  The approximately 2 million megawatt hours of hedging in excess of expected generation is expected to be settled on a profitable basis using financial instruments or additional generation to the extent power prices improve.  Moving to 2013, we have now hedged approximately 19 million megawatt hours at an average price of $37 per megawatt hour.  Further, for 2014 we have hedged approximately 11 million megawatt hours at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour.  To assist you in understanding our merchant generation business segment\u2019s margin drivers, we have provided a pie chart that breaks down our 2012 expected revenue by type.","Finally turning to Page 20, here we update our merchant generation segment\u2019s fuel and related transportation hedges.  For 2012, we have hedged approximately 25 million megawatt hours at about $24 per megawatt hour.  For 2013, we have hedged approximately 18 million megawatt hours at about $24.50 per megawatt hour, approximately $1 per megawatt hour less than the number we provided in February.  For 2014, we\u2019ve now hedged approximately 9 million megawatt hours at about $24.50 per megawatt hour, again approximately $1 per megawatt hour less than the number we shared with you in February.  ","Similar to our previous slide detailing merchant generation revenues, we have included a pie chart that breaks down forecasted 2012 all-in fuel costs to provide perspective on how each component contributes to our overall cost.  This completes our prepared remarks.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  We will now be conducting a question and answer session.  If you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.  A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.  You may press star, two if you would like to remove your question from the queue.  We ask that you please limit your time to one question and one follow-up as necessary.  For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.  One moment, please, while we poll for questions.","Thank you.  Our first question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with Keybanc.  Please state your question.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 Keybanc","Can you just give the drivers behind the revised guidance, kind of what drove merchant up?  I guess it was weather that took the regulated down.","Martin Lyons","Sure, Paul, this is Marty.  In terms of the overall guidance, obviously the guidance is affirmed and unchanged; but within the guidance, the regulated upper and lower ends came down about $0.05.  In merchant, lower and upper ends went up by about $0.05, and they netted out, obviously.","The big driver for the quarter, really, in the regulated business was weather, as you heard on the call.  Weather impacted our earnings negatively versus last year by about an estimated $0.13, and versus normal about $0.10.  We had very warm winter weather, and it was that $0.10 weather variance versus normal that caused us to move our guidance down for the regulated businesses by about $0.05.  ","On the merchant side, our guidance had been zero to $0.10 of earnings.  We moved it up to $0.05 to $0.15.  As a result of the impairment of our Duck Creek energy center, depreciation expense will actually be lower going forward, and so the increase in our guidance for merchant reflects that reduction in depreciation expense.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 Keybanc","And is there any precedent for delaying the environmental that you\u2019ve proposed?","Martin Lyons","This is Marty again.  The Illinois Pollution Control Board, who we\u2019ve filed with, has a history of weighing a number of things \u2013 impacts of a proposed variance to the environment, as well as the cost of coming into compliance and economic impacts of the compliance plan that is either planned or the alternatives to that plan.  So they have a history of balancing environmental issues with economic issues, and there has been precedent in the state for variances to be granted.  In fact, there\u2019s some precedent even here with us where variances have in the past been granted by the Pollution Control Board.  So we\u2019re optimistic that our proposed plan will be received favorably by the Board.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 Keybanc","And how is the interplay with EPA regs?","Martin Lyons","Well, as you know, some of those EPA regs are a bit in flux, as we saw the appeal of the CSAPR rules and then the MATS rules come into play later down the line.  You may recall as a result of our compliance with the Illinois multi-pollutant standard, we\u2019ve made significant investments in environmental controls.  We burn low-sulfur Powder River Basin coal.  We control mercury through the use of activated carbon.  We\u2019ve got a lot of controls in our plants, and those controls, those investments are positioning us well in our merchant business for compliance with MATS, and then we\u2019ll see how CSAPR evolves, although we feel like we were positioned well for compliance with the CSAPR rules that existed before as a result, again, of our use of Powder River Basin coal, the scrubbers we have on some of our plants, as well as the decision last year to shut down a couple of our older, uncontrolled plants.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 Keybanc","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.  Please state your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning.  Can you hear me?","Thomas Voss","Yes, Paul, we can.  Good morning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","With respect to the $0.36 of tax adjustment that gets fully reversed, is that going to be showing up in operating earnings going forward for the rest of the year?","Martin Lyons","No.  Let me describe what that is.  Basically what it is from a GAAP accounting standard, we\u2019re required to book to the estimated end of year effective tax rate, which given the impairment charge that we took and projecting out to the end of the year, we\u2019re forecasting about a 24.5% effective tax rate.  So we\u2019re required to book to that in the first quarter.","Because our earnings excluding the impairment charge are seasonal and heavily weighted towards the third quarter, the earnings in the first quarter excluding the impairment charge are pretty low.  So when you take that impairment charge and you tax effect it at, say, a 40% kind of effective tax rate, it has the effect of really pushing the effective tax rate down for the quarter down to a very low level.  So we had to\u2014we described the decrease to the benefit of the Duck Creek impairment tax effect basically increased the effective tax rate up to that 24.5% level in the first quarter.  But between now and the end of the year, and likely between now and the end of the third quarter, that will reverse out.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And will that show up in earnings?","Martin Lyons","Well yes, it would show up in GAAP earnings but not core.","Paul Patterson- Glenrock Associates","Okay, but it won\u2019t be showing up in core earnings.  And the $0.05, that\u2019s for the three quarters ended\u2014I\u2019m sorry, the last three quarters of this year, and I guess the full-year impact will just be\u2014you know, we just annualized that impact?  Is that how we should think about it?","Martin Lyons","Are you talking about the depreciation from\u2014","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Yes, the deprecation from Duck Creek, yeah.","Martin Lyons","Yeah, it\u2019s about\u2014Paul, it\u2019s about $25 million, so I think that\u2019s probably about $0.06 per share, so the $0.05 per share is really this current year expected impact.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And why only Duck Creek?  That was the only one that was impaired.  Is that because of pollution control equipment, or how should we think of that?","Martin Lyons","Well, you\u2019re right, Paul.  That\u2019s exactly right; it\u2019s part of the answer, anyway.  When you do an impairment test from an accounting perspective, first you look at the expected gross cash flows undiscounted over the remaining lives of the generating assets and then compare it to the carrying values.  The Duck Creek facility did have a high book value or carrying value per megawatt, and that was really a function, as you mention, of the environmental equipment that is on that plant and that we invested in.  But also, you might recall, Paul, that generating unit was actually acquired when Ameren acquired CILCORP years ago, and as a result at that time in purchase accounting, that plant was written up to its then fair value.  So it had a higher book value as a result of that purchase accounting, and then on top of that the investments were made for environmental controls, so it had a fairly high book value compared to our other plants.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, great.  Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Terran Miller with Cantor Fitzgerald.  Please state your question.","Terran Miller \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Good morning.  Two follow-up questions \u2013 first is if the Illinois regulators make a decision on the environmental issues, is that going to be precedent-setting for the state or do you think it\u2019s just limited to your request?","Thomas Voss","Well, I think it\u2019s specific to our request.  As I said earlier, I think there is precedent for the Pollution Control Board to grant variances like the one we have requested, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s precedent-setting in terms of the Pollution Control Board ruling favorably in terms of our specific request.  But I don\u2019t think that then would apply to others.  It\u2019s really an Ameren Energy Resources specific variance request.","Terran Miller \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, and just as a follow-up from Paul Ridzon\u2019s question, if CSAPR rules are not changed, can you get to 2020 without having to scrub?","Thomas Voss","Well, I think we\u2019re positioned pretty well for those rules.  I guess I don\u2019t have the data here in front of me to say whether we\u2019ll well positioned all the way out through 2020 or what some of the impacts may be, but we are positioned well for it, again as I mentioned earlier for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  When we looked at the emission allowances or the credits that we had as a result of the shut down of the Meredosia and the Hutsonville facilities we did last year, as well as the pollution control equipment we have in place and the use of the Powder River basin coal, so we\u2019re positioned well.","We\u2019ll see what happens with the CSAPR rules, where they come out; but again, I talked about this on the February call, when we looked at the deceleration of the Newton scrubber, when we looked at the rules that were most restrictive for us out in that 2015 time frame, it was the Illinois multi-pollutant standard that was the significant limitation, absent the scrubbers.","Terran Miller \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.  Please state your question.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management","Hi Marty, how are you doing?  Marty, I just wanted to understand\u2014I guess Genco\u2019s doing really well in terms of free cash flow this year, but the hedging slide that you gave us updated kind of nearly shows if one puts in the remaining non-hedged portion that the price could be dropping something like $9 or $10 on a base around \u201912 to \u201913, which would imply that the business becomes negative cash flow next year.  So can you tell me, what is the plan \u2013 is the parent going to provide, or how are we going to address this negative cash flow going forward?   What is the strategy behind funding the business?","Martin Lyons","Sure, Ashar.  I think, Ashar, we\u2019re still focused on the merchant business and Genco maintaining an ability to meet its own cash needs and to stay cash flow positive, so we haven\u2019t given any guidance yet so I\u2019m\u2014I know you\u2019ve got your own model, I\u2019m not going to comment on the figures you threw out.  But that is our goal, that is our focus, and as you saw earlier this quarter, we did put in place a put option that to the extent Genco found itself needing financial resources, could put its gas-fired assets over to its affiliate for an immediate $100 million of cash, and then that would be trued up to fair value so that it would actually receive fair value for the assets.","That\u2019s consistent with one of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about for a number of quarters, that Genco does have certain assets that it could sell.  We have, as you\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve sold some of our smaller gas-fired units and that\u2019s an option for Genco to the extent that it did need to raise cash as a fall-back.  But it\u2019s certainly focused on trying to reduce its capital expenditures, reduce operating costs, continuing to work to market its power to higher margin customers and meet its own cash needs.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management","Okay, but does the parent in terms of the write-down\u2014or I guess what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re going to sell the assets to fund it, or does the parent need equity to fund it as well going forward?  Is it going to be a combination of both, or it\u2019s just the Genco selling assets and plugging the hole?","Martin Lyons","Well Ashar, I guess the answer I\u2019m trying to convey is first and foremost, they\u2019re going to try to manage operating costs and capital expenditures to work towards a cash flow positive situation.  With respect to Genco, it could then pursue sales of assets, if needed, to generate cash, and those are the primary focus areas.","In terms of the impairment, the impairment was not a Genco asset; it was an energy resources asset but over in the AERG subsidiary, so the impairment really didn\u2019t affect Genco, the legal entity.  It basically rolls up and impacts only Ameren\u2019s financial statements, and as you see today, nearly 52% equity in our total capital structure after the write-off and we have plenty of liquidity \u2013 over $2 billion of liquidity.  So really, no impact on cash.  Our equity content and our cap structure remain strong, and so overall don\u2019t see a need for additional equity at this point.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of David Paz from Bank of America.  Please state your question.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning.  I have a question, just a follow-up on Ashar\u2019s question.  If the Genco put option is exercised, would AERG issue its own debt or would it borrow from the parent?","Martin Lyons","Yeah, David \u2013 no, AERG would borrow from the parent.  AERG doesn\u2019t have any borrowing capacity of its own, so it could borrow from the parent but then the idea, David, is that AERG would be buying those assets from Genco at fair value and could turn around and sell those assets at that price, generate the cash, and pay down that borrowing.  So that\u2019s the idea of it \u2013 that if some amount of money goes into Genco for those assets, an equivalent amount of value comes out in the form of power plants which could then be resold to pay down the debt.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Got it, okay.  My original question was on dividend policy \u2013 I\u2019m curious if you have an update how should we think about dividend policy going forward.  I know you have 6%, or roughly 6%, rate base growth.  Should we expect continued dividend growth?","Thomas Voss","This is Tom Voss.  You know, we really haven\u2019t articulated a dividend growth policy, but it\u2019s management\u2019s objective to continue to grow our utility earnings by making disciplined investments in the utility infrastructure, and as we grow the earnings and cash flows of the regulated business, we\u2019ll continue then hopefully to grow the dividend.  But any future increase will be a Board decision and it will be based on our recent financial performance and current financial position, as well as our outlook for earnings, cash flows, and financial position.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Now is that outlook to earnings exclusive to regulated, or is it overall?","Thomas Voss","Regulated earnings.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Great.  Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Reza Hatefi with Decade Capital Management.  Please state your question.","Reza Hatefi \u2013 Decade Capital Management","Hi, thank you.  I guess you have a great utility rate base kegger, but I assume that\u2019s probably running a little negative cash flow and then we\u2019ll see what happens with the merchant segment.  How should we think about financing over the next two, three years to achieve this rate base kegger?  Do you need to reinstitute the DRIP-dribble or will there be equity in 2013, \u201914?  How is that going to get financed, I guess?","Martin Lyons","Good morning, Reza, this is Marty.  I think when you look out and you do your modeling, I think you should assume that over time we\u2019re going to look to keep the equity content in our cap structure in alignment with generally where it is.  I\u2019ve talked about this before \u2013 generally in that 50 to 53% kind of equity content in the total capital structure.  So as we move through time, we\u2019ll want to keep a strong balance sheet and a strong equity content in our cap structure.  ","As you know, we don\u2019t have the DRIP-dribble program currently issuing any new shares, but as we said I think on our first quarter call, that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll evaluate on a year-to-year basis; and to the extent that equity is needed to keep the balance sheets of our utilities in that strong and that kind of category that I mentioned, we\u2019ll certainly act to do that.","But it\u2019s important when you look out over time to remember that these businesses do generate significant earnings each year over and above that which is paid out in dividends, so there\u2019s the ability to reinvest retained earnings over time.  And I\u2019d also point out that you see the 6% kegger in the overall rate base but you\u2019ve also got an allocation going to those jurisdictions that have formulaic ratemaking, which over time should allow us to continue to bring up our blended earned ROE on that rate base.  So in addition to the 6% rate base, you\u2019ll hopefully also see a little bit of growth in the blended average earned returns, which helps as well.","Reza Hatefi \u2013 Decade Capital Management","And then just finally kind of thinking about your regulated earnings power, should I just basically take this new rate base slide and use that, or is there anything else that I\u2019m missing in terms of getting your regulated earnings power?","Martin Lyons","No, I think you\u2019re on the right track.  I think we just talked about a few things that you would have to consider, and that\u2019s the rate base growth, the allocation of the capital to the various jurisdictions and how that affects the blended earned ROE, and then over time as you model it out, how we would go about financing that, which again I said largely would be through reinvestment of retained earnings, some debt financing, and then depending on your model some consideration of additional equity, but the objective getting to that 50 to 53% equity ratio.","Reza Hatefi \u2013 Decade Capital Management","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you please limit your time to one question and one follow-up as necessary.  Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.  Please state your question.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey guys.  Congrats on a good quarter and obviously in terms of some of the regulatory improvements you\u2019ve made in your jurisdictions over the last couple of years.  O&M \u2013 can you talk\u2014I just want to make sure I understand \u2013 year-over-year from 2011 to 2012, both at the regulated side and at the merchant side, what\u2019s embedded in guidance for year-over-year changes in O&M.","Martin Lyons","Thanks, Michael.  I think we would refer you back to the first quarter call transcript, but I think when you look at overall, it\u2019s in Missouri you\u2019re seeing actually a trend down in O&M.  You\u2019ll recall that late last year, we actually had a voluntary retirement or severance plan that ended up having about a 340 headcount reduction overall between Ameren Missouri as well as our business in corporate services area.  So that\u2019s rolling through in terms of cost savings this year.  ","For the merchant business, we actually kind of gave out a specific number that was down a little bit from the prior year, which was about\u2014an expectation of O&M expense of about $290 million.  Again, like I said, it\u2019s a little bit down from last year.  And then in Illinois, I think the important thing to remember there is whatever the O&M costs are, those will actually be included in the formula ratemaking adjustment that we book this year.  So whether they were to go up or down, it would result in more or less revenue being recognized under the formulaic rate adjustment.  We do expect those O&M expenses, however, to go up as we are ramping up to meet the requirements of the law in terms of investments and job creation.  So those O&M expenses are going up in Illinois this year.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And thinking about Illinois, in your guidance, what rate base is assumed in guidance for 2012, and what earned ROE level is assumed in your guidance level for this year?","Martin Lyons","I\u2019ll see whether somebody has the rate base number \u2013 I don\u2019t have that off the top.  But we did\u2014you know, Michael, overall in terms of the ROE, the midpoint of our ROE reflects about a 9.2% earned ROE, or assumed earned ROE in Illinois.  That assumes average treasury yields of about 3.3% for the year, so that\u2019s the ROE that we had embedded as a midpoint.  You\u2019ll recall that there is a\u2014you know, where the ROE actually ends at the end of the year will be a function of where the 30-year treasury yields actually go over the course of the year, and then there\u2019s a plus or minus 50 basis point collar on that ROE.  ","One thing I might mention is that that plus or minus 50 basis point collar equates to about a plus or minus $0.025 per share, so there\u2019s a band or a collar on the ROE based again on the formula.  ","One of the things I\u2019d point you to just in terms of rate base was that in our January 3 filing \u2013 and this was on Slide 14 \u2013 the rate base in that January 3 filing was about 2.16 billion, actually shown on that slide.  What that represented was the rate base from the 2010 FERC Form 1 plus 2011 and 2012 net plant additions.  And then what that wouldn\u2019t reflect is simply adjustments to the deferred tax balances.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, because I noticed that in the Com Madison (ph) filing process, there was about a $500 million difference in the rate base between the ALHA order and a lot of the company and even the intervenors, which has a significant impact.  Are you guys facing a similar issue?","Martin Lyons","I would say, Michael, that it\u2019s probably in the $200 million range for us, I would believe.  The other thing to remember about Illinois, and that\u2019s just we\u2019re talking about the electric delivery rate base.  You\u2019ve also, of course, got the gas rate base that we\u2019re earning on as well as the transmission rate base in Illinois, so that\u2019s not total Illinois rate base.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Understood.  Thanks, guys.  Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you.  As a reminder, we ask that you limit your time to one question and one follow-up as necessary.  Our next question is from Tom Rebinoff of Fore Research & Management.  Please state your question.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research & Management","Hey guys, good morning.  Just a quick question \u2013 I wanted to go back to CSAPR one more time.  I just wanted to make sure that I understand what you were trying to convey.  So basically you guys said you are well positioned for CSAPR.  So what does that mean exactly, then?  I guess if Illinois does not approve\u2014sorry, if Illinois does approve your request, would you have to spend any more money on CAPEX beyond what you\u2019ve told us already, or is that going to be it?  And then I guess how do we think about what you mentioned on the last call in terms of having to start thinking about the scrubbers for Newton by the end of this year, maybe early next year?","Martin Lyons","Yeah, sure.  You know, I think in terms of CSAPR, again, when we looked out to 2015 absent the Newton scrubber and if the multi-pollutant standard wasn\u2019t in place, we believe we were positioned well for compliance with CSAPR and don\u2019t believe the Newton scrubber would be needed to meet the CSAPR requirements.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re very focused on the multi-pollutant standard variance and relief.  Your question about the considerations around the Newton scrubber \u2013 obviously we\u2019re pursuing this relief from the Pollution Control Board relative to the MPS.  Absent that relief, we would be sort of back to where we were, I would say, when we last talked on our year-end earnings call, which would be that we believe that if we reaccelerate the scrubber project, it would take about 20 to 24 months to complete that; and again, the way the multi-pollutant standard currently works, there\u2019s a ratchet down in terms of SO2 emissions out in the 2015 time frame.  So sometime in the first half of next year is sort of the point that is critical, and if we decided to reaccelerate sometime in the first half of next year, we\u2019d be in a position to have the scrubbers in place the first half of 2015.","But again, there are a lot of factors we\u2019ll consider in making that evaluation and making that decision.  Today, as we\u2019ve said, market prices and capacity prices just don\u2019t seem to justify completion of that scrubber, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate things as we move through time.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research & Management","Okay, got it.  And so then a quick follow-up question \u2013 I guess it\u2019s the Illinois Pollution Control Board that will have to opine on your request.  Now, is the MISO\u2014or I guess, does the MISO have a say in this at all, or no?","Martin Lyons","No, I don\u2019t believe so.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research & Management","Okay, got it.  Thank you, guys.  Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Alex Tai of Standard General.  Please state your question.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Hi guys, good morning.  I actually just wanted to follow up on Tom\u2019s question there.  Specifically, you said that you probably will not need a scrubber if you comply, you believe, with the EPA regs.  So what about other forms of capital expenditure?  Would you need anything else, or do you think you\u2019re all set, period?","Thomas Voss","You were breaking up a little bit, but I think your question was would the capital expenditures that we\u2019ve got, or the pollution control equipment that\u2019s in place, we\u2019d be sort of all set.  I think the answer is yes.  We\u2019ve made significant investments in pollution control equipment.  We\u2019re incurring significant O&M costs today for compliance with the multi-pollutant standard, and those things position us well in terms of the federal air emissions rules that we\u2019re aware of today.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Got it, okay.  So it really is only the state pollution rules that are imposing the need for new environmental capital expenditures?","Thomas Voss","Well, yes, for this Newton scrubber project, that\u2019s right; and again, I\u2019d refer you to our five-year CAPEX plans that we put out in our 10-K, and you\u2019ll see them updated in the 10-Q, but really no change.  Based on the equipment we\u2019ve got in place, the capital expenditure plans we\u2019ve laid out, we believe we\u2019ll be positioned well.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Okay.  And this is a slightly different but same line of questioning, I guess \u2013 you\u2019ve disclosed that you\u2019ve increased the hedges on the merchant generating segment.  Is there any breakdown of where those new hedges are?  Are they within the Genco or within AERG?","Thomas Voss","Yeah, no breakdown there.  You know, they\u2019re AER overall hedges.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Got it.  Okay, great.  Thank you, guys.","Doug Fischer","This is Doug Fischer.  Operator, we\u2019ve exceeded our scheduled hour but I think we\u2019ll take just two more questions.  So Operator, if you\u2019d please put those through.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischer.  Our next question is from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hey, good morning.  So first, you\u2019ve talked a lot about the peaker asset sales.  Just kind of curious \u2013 any outlook in terms of getting that done and the follow-up there?  The Grand Towers unit, I imagine that one has got a better heat rate.  How much did it run in the quarter?","Thomas Voss","Julian, I don\u2019t have any specific data on Grand Tower or the other couple of peakers to share with you.  We do expect the Grand Tower will be running more this year than it has in the past, given the low power prices.  Overall on your other question, really no update on the overall process.  Again, the put option was put in place really as more of a\u2014if an emergency situation need arose, Genco could put those assets.  You know, one of the things we pointed out on our year-end call was that Genco had money pool loans that were made to affiliates at year-end.  Those balances have actually grown a little bit here in the first quarter.  I think when you see their balance sheet, I think they\u2019ve got about $95 million loan to affiliates, so really no immediate need for cash.  There is\u2014you know, the loans that have been made to affiliates, so there\u2019s really no process underway right now to sell those assets. ","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great.  And just to make sure I heard you loud and clear here, in terms of actually achieving that 0.38 standard under the new 2020 extension, there really is nothing incrementally for you to do \u2013 it\u2019s probably just running a little bit more of the, call it running perhaps your scrubber just a little bit harder, or something like that.  Is it something akin to that?","Thomas Voss","Julian, that\u2019s right.  We have the ability, given the controls we\u2019ve put in place, to meet that more stringent standard, and with no additional cost.  So we, again, believe that\u2019s something that, as you say, if we push the scrubber equipment that we\u2019ve got in place, we\u2019ll be able to achieve that.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","All right, great.  Thanks for being explicit there.","Operator","Thank you.  Our final question today is coming from Raymond Leung of Goldman Sachs.  Please state your question.","Raymond Leung \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys.  Thanks for the call.  A couple of my big questions were answered with respect to where you were getting the cash on the put and the intercompany loan; but can you talk about how you guys are thinking about\u2014I think in your K, you indicated that you may trip to your covenant.  Should we just assume that bank line, you can\u2019t access that going forward?  And just to clarify, you indicated if you were to comply with the Illinois rule here that you probably wouldn\u2019t see much of an incremental increase in the operating costs if you got the variance?","Thomas Voss","Right.  So that is what I just said \u2013 is that we wouldn\u2019t expect to see incremental operating costs as a result of the variance being granted.  And I think your other question was\u2014I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the other question?","Raymond Leung \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well, you guys indicated in your K that you may sort of trip an interest covenant test.  Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about that and how you may try to deal with that, or if you think you can deal with it at all?","Thomas Voss","Yeah, yeah.  I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I was focused on the second question and had forgotten the first.  But yeah, when you end up seeing our disclosures for the first quarter, they\u2019ll mirror those from year-end, that essentially based on the covenant that borrowings at Genco we forecast to be restricted by the end of the first quarter of next year.  So there won\u2019t be any change in the disclosures in the Q relative to the K, which is why we put the put option in place.  We wanted to make sure there was clarity in terms of if Genco needed access to cash, access to liquidity, how would it arrange that, because as you say, looking ahead one might assume really no borrowing access under the revolver, based on that disclosure that we\u2019ve made.","Raymond Leung \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks.","Doug Fischer","Okay, this is Doug Fischer.  I want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call.  Let me remind you again that this call is available for one year on our website.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and an update on financial and regulatory matters including 2017 earnings considerations. We will then open the call for questions. Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Doggie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared to earnings of $1.41 per share in last year's third quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher electric sales to residential loan and commercial customers driven by warmer summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC regulated transmission and Illinois Electric Distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers.","These favorable items were partially offset by lower electrics sales to the new Madrid Aluminum smelter; historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year operations at this smelter were suspended and it remains shutdown. Overall, our third quarter results were strong as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that -- for the second time this year, we have raised our 2016 earnings guidance. Our new guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75 per share, up from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, reflecting the strong year-to-date results.","Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We continue to successfully execute the strategy and remain convinced it will deliver superior of long-term value to both, our customers and shareholders. I'd like to take a few moments and highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments towards this end. To begin, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery; and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.","As you can see, year-to-date we've invested almost $1 billion of capital in jurisdictions with fee supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost two-thirds of our year-to-date 2016 capital spending and included approximately $510 million of investment and FERC regulated transmission projects. The largest of these remains ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers Transmission Project. For this projects nine line segments; including two river crossings have been energized and work on the other segments and the third river crossing is well underway. Further eight of the projects ten substations are now in service with the remaining two under construction.","Regarding ATXI's $150 million Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, construction is being completed on two substations. In addition, we are acquiring the balance of need right away and have just begun clearing land on certain sections of the project with significant mine construction expected to begin in January. As for the $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeast Missouri, we recently initiated core proceedings in order to obtain a sense of road crossings from the five counties where the line is planned to be constructed. When completed these three massive multi-value projects will deliver significant customer and community benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region including northeast Missouri. In addition, these projects are creating jobs.","We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren, Illinois's Transmission System that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.","Turning to Page 6 of our presentation; let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan in Ameren, Illinois. We invested approximately $480 million in Illinois Electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first nine months. These include investments made under the Company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. In September the ICC approved Ameren, Illinois request to expand the installation of smart electric meters from 62% to 100% of customers. This approval is a testament to the smart meter benefits achieved so far and takes advantage of the infrastructure; processes and teams already in place to efficiently and effectively deploy additional new meters.","ICC approval of this request also supports increasing the installation of smart gas meter modules from 56% to 100% of customers. The approximately $150 million incremental investment to expand deployment of electric and gas smart meters to all of our Illinois customers was included in the multi-year capital spending we shared with you earlier this year. As you can see on the right side of this page, Ameren, Illinois plans to install approximately 1.25 advanced electric meters and upgrade approximately 830,000 gas meter modules by the end of 2019. Through September of this year, approximately 352,000 electric and 178,000 gas meters have been installed. Since we began to deploy advanced metering technology, Ameren, Illinois has reduced estimated meter reads by over 440,000 and eliminating the need for nearly 100,000 service visits.","Lastly, this year Ameren, Illinois launched a peak time rewards program allowing customers with new smart meters to manage usage during peak summer days. More than 8,000 participated saving an estimated 47,000 kilowatt hours. Clearly, the smart grid investments are saving Ameren, Illinois customers money by allowing them to better manage power usage while they experience fewer and short of power outages. In fact, the frequency and duration of Ameren, Illinois power outages have been reduced by averages of 17% and 18% respectively from the baseline set by the State's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. As a result, Ameren, Illinois electric distribution initiatives remain on-track to meet or exceed investment, liability, and smart meter goals established in this act.","In addition, Ameren, Illinois enhanced framework for natural gas distribution is driving greater levels of investment in energy infrastructure. These natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are also improving the safety and reliability of that system. It is clear that modernize industry policies in Illinois are driving significant incremental investments in its electric in natural gas energy infrastructure; together these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable rates but they have also created a significant number of new jobs in the State of Illinois.","Turning the Page 7 of our presentation; let me provide a business update on Missouri. In July Ameren, Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue to begin to recover and earn a return on energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates and to reflect reduced sales due to the suspension of operations at the new Madrid smelter among other things. Marty will discuss our filling in more detail in a moment. We expect the Missouri PSE to issue a decision in this rate review in late April with new rates expected to be effective in late May of next year.","Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. Two separate efforts were initiated by the State to evaluate the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri's energy infrastructure. One by the Missouri PSE and the other by interim committee. We appreciate the time and effort being undertaken to study this important issue.","I will start by providing an update on the Missouri PSE effort. To begin, over the last several months, the Missouri PSE requested and received extensive comments from stakeholders in how the workshop to assist in their consideration of policies to improve the way it regulates electric utilities. In this workshop and later in filings with the PSE, Ameren, Missouri highlighted the issues associated with Missouri's ageing energy infrastructure, as well as the fact that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately support investment. Our filings also cited several approaches that are being successfully utilized around the country to address the issues that Missouri now faces; including performance-based formulated grade making, and forward test years, as well as trackers and writers.","Importantly, we highlighted the significant long-term customer and state-wide benefits that would be realized by changes in energy policies that would support incremental energy infrastructure investment. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and in other jurisdictions around the country, modernize policies to support energy infrastructure investments would create a more reliable and smarter grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, as well as create significant jobs. In addition, we believe these investments will position Missouri to keep pace with the evolving electric grid and meet its customers rising energy needs and expectations. We believe the electric system will continue to evolve to a more integrated, our central and distributed generation, transmission and distribution systems, as well as customers and businesses with the smart meters plans and equipment; all work together to continuously, instantaneously and reliably maintain the balance between resources and demand.","Benefits from such a system must be enabled by investments to support a more sophisticated and resilient transmission and distribution infrastructure. These investments must also be enabled by modernized energy policy. With these benefits in mind in late September, Ameren, Missouri filed with the Missouri PSE a detailed plan for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a five-year period ended in 2022 with additional projects of more than $1 billion that could be accelerated over this period should they be deemed appropriate when taken into consideration customer rate impact.","Further, we indicated that a total of more than $4 billion potential incremental infrastructure investments for over 10-year period has been identified. In that same filing, we outlined several energy policy alternatives that will enable these important investments which would drive significant long-term benefits for our customers and the State of Missouri. On October 17, the Missouri PSE staff issued this report regarding proposed improvements to the state's electric utility regulation. Staff indicated it was not opposed to several approaches for supporting targeted investments which would continue to include strong PSE oversight [ph]. These approaches include certain trackers and writers, service accounting, interim rate, largely forecasted test years and an electric infrastructure system replacement surcharge. We appreciate this task consideration of several tools used in other states to support investment for the benefit of customers and the state. This report is an important step and we look forward to continue discussion with all stakeholders.","Turning to this Interim Committee efforts; in August and October the Committee held hearings which provided a form for Missouri stakeholders and outside experts to provide their perspectives and the state's current utility regulation and how it might be modernized to support increased investment. Those hearings have been very informative and they provided another opportunity to discuss this important energy policy issue with key stakeholders, outside of the very busy legislative session. As we continue to engage with stakeholders; I am more convinced than ever that improvements in Missouri's regulatory framework were in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri. We expect reports of the Missouri PSE and the Senate Interim Committee to be issued no later than December 1 and December 31, respectively.","In the meantime, we are also taking other steps to better position Missouri for the future. In particular we have proposed several pilot programs in Missouri PSE. A pilot program offering customers subscription based solar power has been approved by the Missouri PSE for proposed pilot programs of building solar facilities and partnership of large customers, and for building electric vehicle charging stations along our corridor in the state are pending before the commission.","I will now move to Page 8 and our long-term rate-based growth outlook. In February of this year we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 through 2020. Our execution of this plan remains on-track. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital or regulated electric transmission and Illinois Electric and natural gas distribution services as these jurisdictions provide a constructive regulatory frameworks and the investments provided significant long-term benefits to our customer.","Turning now to Page 9, here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the grid needs to be modernized to meet our customer's future energy needs and expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, the allocation of capital to transmission and electric and gas distribution is expected to grow these businesses to nearly three quarters of our rate base by year end 2020. Further we are focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Consequently, our investment in coal and gas power generation is expected to decline to 15% of rate base by year-end 2020. This transition will continue beyond 2020 with the retirement of our Meramec coal-fired energy centers in 2022.","In addition, Ameren, Missouri is developing its next integrated resource plan which will be filed with the Missouri PSE in October 2017. In this plan we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment, and of course, our shareholders.","Turning now to Page 10; in addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current five-year period, as just mentioned, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2020. With the support of constructive Illinois rate-making, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas distribution systems in the state. This includes investments to upgrade and replace gas transmission pipeline, underground storage facilities, and distribution infrastructure to comply with the expected new federal safety regulations.","Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects which maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet noted [ph] requirements, replace ageing infrastructure and modernize the grid. We also plan to pursue potential local and regional transmission opportunities to upgrade the grid to maintain system voltages and reliability is generating plants to close in response to power market economics in the clean power plant.","Finally, our transmission development team continues to pursue regional electric transmission projects focusing on the MISO, PGM and Southwest Power [ph]. For Missouri we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. We will continue to provide safe and adequate service which includes replacing ageing transmission and distribution infrastructure when needed. We will also make investments needed to comply with the clean power plant. And as discussed earlier, there are also numerous opportunities for incremental investments in Missouri should the regulatory framework improve. These opportunities include investments in smart meters, replacement of ageing substations and other equipment, modernizing the underground grid in transmission, as well as adding renewables.","To cross our entire system will also make important investments in information technology and cyber security. The bottom-line is that we believe the investment opportunities that I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders in the decade ahead.","Turning now to Page 11, let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy in delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward we have a superior long term earnings growth outlook driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investment in jurisdictions with a constructive rate making and in areas that provide long term value to our customers. I am pleased to note that last month our board of directors increased their quarterly dividend 3.5% to $0.44 per share reflecting confidence in our outlook for our businesses in our long term strategy. This increase resulted in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% to be in annual earnings. Of course future dividend increases will be based on consideration of among other things earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions. A strong earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend currently yielding approximately 3.6% results in a total return opportunity for our shareholders. ","To summarize we are committed to executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today.","Now I will turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Warner. Good morning everyone and turning now to page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.11 cents per share year over year increase. Warmer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.11 per share versus 2015 and $0.10 per share versus normal conditions as we experienced the fourth hottest third quarter including the hottest September since 1970. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.09 per share including changes and allowed returns on equity compared to the year ago period. ","With regard to returns on equity third quarter 2016 results from our first regulated transmission businesses benefited from a temporarily higher ROE as compared to the prior period reflecting the expiration in May of the fifteen month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint kit. The first order in the first complaint case then lowered the ROE in late September, the 10.82% including our 50 basis point adder. Turning to our Illinois electric distribution business third quarter results reflected a ROE under formulaic rate making of 8.29% compared to 8.7% for the year ago period. The third quarter 2016 allowed ROE was based on an assumed average 30 year Treasury rate of 2.49% for the full year 2016. ","Factors that had an unfavorable effect on third quarter earnings comparisons included the loss of sales to the new Madrid smelter and increased Ameren Missouri depreciation expense which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share respectively. And finally the year over year third quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan, for earnings neutral as the carry over effect of lower sales resulting from this plan that by recognition of $19 million or $0.05 per share for a portion of our performance incentive award associated with energy efficiency result achieved over the 2013 through 2015 period. ","In total based on the elation and agreement approved by the Missouri P.S.T. earlier this week, Cameron Missouri will recognize $28 million or $0.07 per share of total incentive award in 2016 including the previously mentioned $0.05 per share in the third quarter and an additional $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that we're able to reach agreement with the P.S.T. staff and the Office of Public Counsel on these incentive awards and believe this outcome reflects the tremendous success of the 2013 or 2015 via a program for our customers. Before moving on Let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date compared to the prior year.","Overall we experienced trends similar to those discussed on our last two quarterly calls. Although we did see some improvement in the third quarter. Weather normalized kilowatt hour's sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up slightly year-to-date. As underlying growth and the Leap Day sales benefit more than offset energy efficiency impact. Kilowatt hour's sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 2% year-to-date primarily reflecting lower sales to several low margin Illinois customers including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. ","However we have seen improvement in the second and third quarters as industrial scale global appear to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Finally kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down approximately one half of one percent excluding lower sales to the number in Iran to smelter. Turning to page 14 of our presentation, I would like to move from this discussion of sales to a discussion of our earnings guidance for the year. As Warner stated we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share and our original February guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. ","The increased guidance from February reflects strong year-to-date results including the first quarter $0.09 per share tax benefit associated with share based compensation and estimated $0.11 per share whether benefit compared to normal driven by warmer summer temperatures as well as disciplined cost management. Factors that are expected to have a favorable effect on year-over-year fourth quarter results included an assumed return to normal temperatures compared to much milder than normal temperatures in last year's fourth quarter, continued increased electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investment by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rate in 2016. ","Factors that are expected to have an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparison include carry over impacts of Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan with the recognition of the majority of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency performance incentive award in the third quarter, we revised the expected unfavorable year-over-year fourth quarter impact of the 2015 plan to $0.08 per share from our prior estimate of $0.03 per share. Further we expected the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings comparison to be unfavorably affected by lower sales to the new Madrid smelter and regulatory lag related to increase to Missouri depreciation and transmission expenses.","Moving to page fifteen. Here we highlight the select ending regulatory matters. Starting with Missouri and our pending electric rate review we requested a $206 million annual revenue increase that is primarily driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales largely driven by this suspension of operations at the new Madrid smelter and recover increase MYSO transmission charges. To address the last item we have also requested the implementation of a new MYSO transmission trackers in the rate review. ","We expect the Missouri P.S.T. to complete their review by late April of next year with new rates expected to be effective in late May. Moving on Ameren Illinois made its required annual elector distribution rate update filing with the ICC in April of this year under Illinois formula rate making framework. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual costs and expected 2016 infrastructure investment that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting the completion of the recovery of 2014 actual costs by the end of this year. Last week and ALJ proposed order recommended a $14 million net revenue requirement decrease in line with our filing. This recommendation is further evidence of the consistent constructive treatment, Ameren Illinoi is receiving under the state electric formula rate making framework, and I see the decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. ","Finally, in the first of the two complaint cases the thoughts to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, the FERC issued its order in September, adopting 10.32% base ROE in line with the ALJ's recommendation.","In the second case, the first ALJ has recommended a 9.7% base ROE and first orders expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these cases, we have accrued a reserve for estimated refund of $61 million as of September 30, 2016. That is consistent with the FERC order in the first case and the ALJ's recommendation in the second case. ","In addition to the MISO base ROE, Ameren Illinois and ATXI receive a further approved ROE at or of up to 50 basis point affective in January 2015, for their participation in MISO.","Moving now to Page 16. We plan to provide 2017 earnings guidance when we release the fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2016 year-to-date financial results and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider if you think about our earnings outlook for next year.","Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our FERC regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under formula forward looking rate making. ","However, we expect these earnings to be unfavorably impacted by a projected lower weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to 2016. For Ameren Illinois selected distribution service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made there under Illinois formula rate making.","The allowed ROE will be of course, the average of 2017 30 year Treasury yield plus 5.7%. In addition every Illinois gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments, that are included in a rate on a timely basis, under the state gas infrastructure writer.","For Missouri, the 2017 earnings comparison, is expected to be favorably affected by increased Missouri electric service rate to be implemented as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and a return on new infrastructure investment, as well as more recent sales and cost levels.","The incorporation of more recent sales level, is expected to remove the negative earnings effect from lower sales to the demanded smelter [ph] adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison as we now expect an estimated $0.03 per share a negative impact from this dispensing of operations in the first five months 2017. ","We expect Ameren Missouri's 2017 result, to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses, particularly in the first five months of the year before new rates become effective. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017. Of the $0.07 per share energy efficiency performance incentive award, to be recognized in 2016 which I previously discussed.","And a return to normal weather in 2017, would reduce combined Ameren Illinois and Ameren in Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2016. Assuming of course normal weather in the last quarter of this year. ","Finally, we expect expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of 2017 to be comparable to those experienced in the spring outage this year. Moving then to pair another, we expect lower tax benefit associated with share based compensation next year compared to this year. ","Turning to Page 17 I will summarize. We continue to successfully execute strategy and have delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date results. These results allowed us to increase our 2016 earnings guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. On a February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 using our then adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.53 as a base.","This earnings growth outlook was driven by 6.5% compound annual rate base growth, over the 2015 to 2020 period, based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions, made for the benefit of customers.","Our recently increased dividend provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.6%, which is above average compared to fully rate regulated utility peers. When you combine our strong earnings growth outlook with this dividend, we believe our common stock provides a very attractive total Return potential for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks we now invite your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg [ph] with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi, thank you. I was wondering if the sale of the Noranda's smelter will have -- how that would impact your case and ongoing operations and recovery. ","Warner Baxter","Hi, Greg this is Warner. Glad to have you join us, so in terms of the scale of the Noranda's smelter, frankly not sure if that has really any impact on the case. That sale has been completed, not sure exactly what the future is of the smelter at this stage, but we don't see it having any particular impact on the case, Michael Moehn, our President, Ameren; any further comment on that?","Michael Moehn","I think that's right.

I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our coworkers, our community's first responders, volunteers, leaders and emergency personnel who have been tirelessly working together to help protect the citizens of Missouri and Illinois from the record floods that we have experienced this week. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost loved ones, their homes or businesses during this very trying period of time. From an operational perspective, our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions. However, this unprecedented weather is not over. So we will continue to be focused on safety in all of our activities and we will continue to work closely with local and state authorities to deliver energy to our customers in a safe and reliable fashion.","Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared to earnings of $0.43 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016. Highlighted on this page are key drivers of these results, which Marty will discuss in a few minutes. I am also pleased to report that due to a constructive Missouri electric rate settlement and disciplined cost management, we remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range despite very mild first quarter temperatures.","Turning now to page five. Here, we reiterate our long-standing and effective strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe that it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital for our businesses were investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.","This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page. As you can see, we invested more than $300 million or 61% of first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This included about $135 million of capital for FERC regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO approved Illinois Rivers project, a new high-voltage transmission line that will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project is about 78% complete, with four of its nine line segments energized, including two river crossings and with eight of 10 substations now in service and the remaining two expected to be in service by the end of this month. The project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.","A second MISO approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois will span 44 miles and include one new substation. Foundation work on this transmission line began in January and the new substation was completed and placed in service in March. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2018.","Moving to our third MISO approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there have been several recent developments. In March, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District vacated the certificate of convenience and necessity for the project granted by the Missouri Public Service Commission in April 2016. The court ruled that the Missouri PSE erred in granting a certificate that was conditioned upon ATXI obtaining assents for transmission line road crossings from the five affected counties. We are currently evaluating whether to appeal this ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. Meanwhile ATXI continues to pursue it suits by last October seeking to obtain assents for the original project route. A decision in these lawsuits is expected in late 2017.","While we continue to pursue the construction of Mark Twain transmission line under our original plan, we listened to feedback from key stakeholders and evaluated other approaches to address their concerns. We held further discussions with community members, landowners, County commissioners and local and state representatives and assessed alternative route options for the project. I believe these discussions and additional assessments have proven to be fruitful because earlier this week, ATXI announced a proposed alternative route that would use existing transmission line corridors for nearly 90% of the project. This alternative route is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project costs. This route would significantly minimize the impact to landowners, communities and farmland.","To accomplish this, ATXI is collaborating with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and with the Ameren Missouri on proposed alternative route. ATXI will finalize the alternative route after obtaining public input and then request assents for road crossings from the commissioners in the five affected counties. Upon receiving the county assents, ATXI will then seek Missouri PSC approval. We look forward to continue to work with key stakeholders and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward. The planned in-service date for the Mark Twain project is late 2019.","We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois's local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.","Moving on to our other segments. We also invested about $170 million in Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These include investments made under the company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011. That was extended through 2022 by the Future Energy Jobs Act. Today, Ameren Illinois's electric grid modernization initiatives have resulted in an overall 17% improvement in reliability and are saving customers an estimated $45 million each year.","Ameren Illinois has installed 460,000 electric smart meters and 250,000 gas meter modules at customer premises and this year, we plan to install 300,000 advanced electric meters and upgrade 140,000 gas meter modules as we work to deploy these to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. These smart meters and modules provide Ameren Illinois customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.","Turning now to page six for Missouri business update. I am pleased to report that on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive agreement among all parties in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. We appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved in the case and consider the unanimous agreement a positive constructive step forward. Marty will review the key provisions of this agreement in his remarks.","Moving now to a discussion of our efforts to modernize the Missouri regulatory framework for electric utility service. As we speak today, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri The Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act remains on the Missouri Senate's informal calendar and is available for further debate. This legislation will implement regulatory reforms to modernize existing energy policies that would drive significant investment and enable Ameren Missouri to execute its $1 billion incremental infrastructure investment plan over the next five years.","These investments would result in significant long-term benefits to customers including providing a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, delivering greater tools to customers for managing their energy usage and positioning us to meet customers' rising energy needs and expectations. And clearly these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the State of Missouri. In addition, this legislation has robust economic development provisions for large electricity users that will also drive meaningful job creation.","Importantly, the legislation has strong consumer protections including significant Missouri PSC oversight. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, including the Missouri PSC and a Senate Interim Committee, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support including from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the agricultural community and many other stakeholders.","This unprecedented support has helped drive strong bipartisan support of SB 190 in the legislature. While much progress has been made in designing constructive forward thinking legislation, this legislation was filibustered by a small group of State Senators during debate several weeks ago. While I believe that a strong majority of the Senate wish to see SB 190 come to a vote over the last several weeks, the Senate has spent time on other legislative matters, including the budget. Some of these legislative mattes have staled debate on a number of bills, including SB 190.","While we continue to work with key stakeholders to plan a constructive path forward, time is short as the current general assembly session ends next Friday, May 12. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that SB 190 will advance during this legislative session. Of course, should SB 190 not advance during this legislative session, we will be very disappointed. However, we will not be deterred from advocating for important energy and economic policies in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri. And I do expect that we would leverage the progress we made during this session and support another legislative initiative in the next session.","Turning now to page seven. In February, we rolled forward our five-year investment plan which provides for rate based growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we plan to continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Clearly, execution of our five-year investment plan is not contingent on the passage of legislation in Missouri.","Also in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier this year. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers. Further Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend and our Board has increased the dividend in each of the last three years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3.2% results in an attractive total return opportunities for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. As a matter of fact, by successfully executing our strategy we have seen total shareholder return performance of 63% over the last three calendar years, beating indices that measured performance of our utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I am firmly convinced that doing so would deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.","Again, thank you all for joining us today and I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Great. Thanks Warner and good morning everyone. Turning now to page nine of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.01 per share decrease.","Starting with Ameren Transmission, the earnings per share contribution from this segment increased from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic rate making.","Next, the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment saw its first quarter year-over-year contribution rise from $0.04 to $0.12 per share. This reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic rate making by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. First quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 9.06% compared to 8.71% for the year-ago quarter.","Turning to Ameren Missouri. First quarter year-over-year earnings declined from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. Approximately $0.03 of that decline was due to lower electric sales primarily driven by very mild winter temperatures. As a matter fact, first quarter 2017 temperatures were the second warmest on record since 1970, based on heating degree data in our service territory. The Ameren Missouri comparison was also unfavorably affected by higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.","These unfavorable factors were partially offset by $0.01 per share of lower other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms. This reduction is indicative of our ongoing continuous improvement programs and disciplined cost management.","Finally, the Ameren Parent and other net cost comparison was unfavorably impacted by the expected lower first quarter tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which reduced the earnings comparison by $0.07per share.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat reflecting underlying 2017 growth offset by energy efficiency and the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased about 3.5% primarily due to lower sales to a large low margin processor of agricultural products.","Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were flat excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. I would note that while the level of sales to the smelter reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the level established in the April 2015 rate order, the year-over-year decline in sales to the smelter did not have a material impact on the earnings per share comparison.","Moving to page 10 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share despite very mild first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal. The earnings effect of the mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset by the early resolution of the Missouri rate review, which I will touch on in a moment, as well as continued disciplined cost management.","Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page. I will not comment on each of these considerations, since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed all but the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution on our February earnings call. This additional consideration is discussed in a bullet about two-thirds of the way down this page. As I noted, this change had a favorable impact on first quarter 2017 results.","Had this change in the timing of revenue recognition been effective in 2016, it would have increased Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2016, by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter while decreasing earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter with no effect on full year earnings. These estimated 2016 quarterly earnings changes can be a guide to the expected impact of this timing change on 2017 quarterly results.","Turning to page 11 and the recently concluded Ameren Missouri electric rate review. On March 8, the Missouri PSC approved the stipulation and agreement that resolved this rate review. As many of you know, this agreement was a black box settlement and therefore the final order does not provide as much specificity as previous orders. To assist in your analysis, this page outlines key takeaways from the stipulation and agreement as compared to Ameren Missouri's most recent prior rate order issued by the Missouri PSC in April 2015.","Effective April 1, base electric revenues were increased by $92 million annually, 80% of which we expect to realize this year and which includes removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. Concurrently, net base energy cost decreased by $54 million annually, excluding cost reductions associated with reduced sales volumes. This updated level of net base energy costs will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider.","In addition, net amortization and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms were reduced by $26 million annually, which was largely driven by a $21 million reduction in the base level of pension and OPEB expenses. The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE, a rate base level or a common equity ratio. However, the Missouri PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.2% to 9.7% is reasonable. This represented the high and low ends of the ranges the parties to the case stated were embedded in the agreement","We will use a 9.53% ROE, the level authorized in our April 2015 order to calculate allowance for funds used during construction as supported by the Missouri PSC staff in commission open meeting. And in the absence of the stated ROE in the rate agreement, our goal continues to be to earn as close to the April 2015 authorized ROE of 9.53%on Ameren Missouri's capital structure as possible. Finally, the approved agreement provided for continuation of key trackers and riders including the fuel adjustment clause.","Moving now to page 12. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula rate making, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs.","Our filing seeks a $16 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This net amount includes revenue increases reflecting 2016 recoverable costs, expected 2017 infrastructure investments and recovery in 2018 of the 2016 revenue requirement reconciliation. These increases are more than offset by a revenue decrease due to recovery by year-end 2017 of previously unrecovered costs associated with the 2015 revenue requirement reconciliation. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year.","I remind you that each year's Illinois Electric Distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE which is the annual average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized capital structure with the equity component expected to remain 50% and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing or the current rates charged to customers.","Finally, a second complaint case seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI is pending at the FERC. An Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision in June of last year recommending a 9.7% base ROE. In addition, our Ameren Transmission business has been authorized by FERC to add up to 50 basis points to MISO's base allowed ROE reflecting voluntary participation in MISO. A final order from the FERC is expected this year.","Of course, the timing of this decision will depend in part on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum exists at the FERC. In addition, we expect deferred commissioners may take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit vacating the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case as such ruling may influence its order in the pending MISO case.","Turning to page 13, I will summarize. We remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.65per share to $2.85 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate based growth and disciplined financial management and the Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning Paul.","Marty Lyons","Good morning Paul.","Paul Patterson","The FERC completed and I am sorry if I missed this, so the DC Circuit decision, does that change any of this, in your opinion?","Marty Lyons","Yes. Paul, this is Marty. We commented on that right there at the end of our prepared remarks. That case, I wouldn't say has any direct impact on the MISO ROE complaint cases, but of course the methodology that the FERC used to determine the outcome of the first complaint case and also underscored the ALJ's decision in the second complaint case. We are certainly in line with that methodology that the FERC used in the New England case. So again, no direct impact, but of course the methodology did underlie the findings of the FERC and the ALJ, as I mentioned. So as we look ahead, we suspect that once the FERC has a quorum and they look to decide on the second complaint case, they will want to take into consideration the court's findings in the first case as they think about how they will rule in the second. And it's hard to predict, but we suspect that it could end up factoring into the timing in terms of the FERC's in the second case.","Paul Patterson","But with respect to the 2016, the finding whether or not the original rate was unjust and unreasonable, that element doesn't seem to be, do I understand that you don't think that portion of the DC Circuit's ruling applies? Is that right? Or is not applicable to this? That's what I am a little bit confused about.","Marty Lyons","Well, I think in our cases, like in the New England case, I mean they have to do both, right. They have to determine that the existing rate is unjust and unreasonable and then secondarily determine that the new rate is properly supported by the evidence in the record. So I think both of those things apply in both of the cases. And so I think when they look at those cases, they will be taking both of those things into consideration.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just on the 9% rate base growth in Illinois and should we expect a decrease in O&M or fuel and purchase power costs or just in general operational cost or productivity increase as a result of this? Or is it where the rate base goes, that doesn't really do that as kind of replacement or what happened? So I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that.","Marty Lyons","Yes. I assume you are specifically talking about the electric distribution. But absolutely, what the customers in Illinois are seeing as a result of the investments we are making are both improvements in reliability and decreased costs overall as a result of the investments we are making. And I would also note that over time, the customers rates are also being positively impacted by the lower power and capacity prices that we have been seeing in the Illinois apart from the positive impact of the investments that we are making in the Illinois electric distribution system.","Paul Patterson","Do you think because of the low, I mean Dynegy is kind of crying out there about how the price is so low they can't go on this way. Is there any opportunity for you guys to, I know things would actually have to change there in Illinois, but I am just wondering if there is an opportunity there for you to provide some sort of resource or something in Illinois or just any thoughts about what Dynegy is talking about with the low price that came in?","Marty Lyons","Yes. Look, I don't have any specific comment on what Dynegy is seeking. I will say this that today it seems like with respect to capacity that we have the resources in Illinois to serve our customer's need, that I think is evidenced by the low capacity price that we saw this year. Longer term, however, we are certainly concerned about capacity adequacy, reliability and volatility of rates for our customers and as we have in the past, we stand ready to work with all parties in terms of resource adequacy for the State of the Illinois.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Zhou with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","Hi. It's Andy Levi. How are you guys doing?","Warner Baxter","Good morning Andy. How are you?","Andy Levi","I am doing well. Just on the Missouri rate order that you have got and I know you kind of went over it, but I just want to understand the earnings power of it. Can we just go over the three components and how they benefit the income statement, $92 million to $54 million and the $26 million?","Marty Lyons","Yes. So Andy, this is Marty. Absolutely. I think if you refer to slide 10, you will probably get the best picture of that overall in terms of how we expect the impacts to occur. Obviously the first element, which is the $92 million overall increase in rates, which was about 3.5%in terms of customer rate increases, the primary driver. And I would say this year just because of the timing of our rate structure, which we have higher rates in the summer months, about 80% of that will be realized this year.","But if you look at slide 10 and you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case was the net base fuel costs that are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured.","And then lastly, we saw lower amortizations or lower base for things that are amortizations that reflected in riders and trackers also reduced by about $26 million. So those are the primary impacts. We list those in the slides. It's the $92 million rate increase. It's $54 million of reduced net base energy costs and then the $26 million of lower net amortizations. And as you see on slide 10, we list out some of those components.","Andy Levi","I do see that. And this is just, this is not the annualized affect. This is nine months. Is that correct?","Marty Lyons","Yes. That's a good point too, Andy. That is the nine month impact. And so as we look ahead to next year, we would see the full annualized impact of that. That's why I mentioned on the $92 million, it's about 80% of that's realized this year. On the other two, it's about three quarters, about 75% realized this year.","Andy Levi","Right. So really I mean it's not $170 million rate increase, but it's $170 million of earnings benefit pretax.","Marty Lyons","Yes. The rate increase was $92 million, like I said, which is about 3.5%. But then on slide 10, we show you the overall impact.","Andy Levi","Right. And any of those other two components. What have you built into your forecast for 2017 relative to these three items?","Marty Lyons","In our forecast for 2017, that's what we have got on slide 10, as I am understanding.","Andy Levi","I understand that. But originally when you came out with a forecast?","Marty Lyons","You are talking about the guidance?","Andy Levi","Yes. I think the settlement had been already out there, is that correct, before you gave guidance?","Marty Lyons","It is. I understand your question now. When we came out with our guidance for this year, certainly that we had reached the settlement amongst the parties and we believe that the guidance range that we provided accommodated that outcome. Andy I think as you think about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and what we are seeing here today, we have had about $0.08 of negative weather in the first quarter. And as you think about when we provided you that guidance, which was midway through February, certainly we had a sense that weather hit was very mild and that there were some negative impacts.","We also had a sense of this constructive settlement that have been reached. However, the Commission had certainly not yet ruled on it and we really didn't know definitively when the rate increase would go into place. So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range that we gave was appropriate given the multiple things we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the first quarter and if you look ahead, in the first quarter we had about a negative $0.08 of weather and that was offset when you think about the first quarter by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois.","But the Illinois item is simply a timing item whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation in the next nine months. So as we look ahead at the guidance, we obviously left our guidance unchanged and as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by constructive outcome in the rate case and the timing of the rate increase, but also by continued financial management and disciplined cost control.","Andy Levi","Okay. Thank you very much on that. And the other question is just kind of a big picture basis and the reason I am asking it, maybe I shouldn't, I mean hopefully I will like the answer. But obviously this Great Plains, Westar merger is having issues and may or may not happen as they filed for reconsideration today. But I don't know if that's a half-hearted effort or not, but whatever. But then the media talk was like, oh, well then Ameren is going to come and when everything is said and done and take a look at WR and I know you don't like to speak about specific names and all that. So I am not asking you to do that, but just in general, can you kind of address that because over the last two weeks there has been a lot of talk within the investment community concerning that and the concern around that?","Warner Baxter","Andy, this is Warner. I can be happy to address that. Number one, as you rightly said, we never comment on any rumors or M&A activities or speculative transactions, right. But as I said before and I will say it again, I want to be clear, we remain very focused, very focused on executing our strategic plan and that strategic plan is all about organic growth in our regulated business. It's all about executing that rate base growth that we talked about. And that plan has delivered strong total shareholder returns over the last three years. So that's where our focus is.","Andy Levi","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Leslie Rich","Hi. You cited $0.07 per share in corporate from lower tax benefits from share-based compensation and as I go back and look at the first quarter of last year, your tax","rate was particularly low. So I am just wondering if you could talk about sort of the timing there? Was that a benefit that you took in 2016 that didn't recur in 2017? Or is there something changing in terms of the new FASB rules on accounting for stock-based compensation?","Marty Lyons","Yes. Thanks Leslie. This is Marty. Yes, we actually adopted that accounting for stock-based compensation last year in the first quarter. And last year, if you look back, which we were pretty clear about, we had a $0.09 benefit from adoption of that standard in the first quarter of last year. And that really gets to a difference between the value of what employees received at that time versus what had been recognized previously in earnings. So there is a $0.09 benefit last year. This year the benefit was $0.02. And therefore the delta is a negative $0.07 year-over-year.","Leslie Rich","Okay. And then our tax rate for the full year, are you still thinking it will around 38%?","Marty Lyons","Absolutely, Leslie. Yes. That's right. So when you look at, it is lower here in the first quarter. I think it was around 35% and changed in terms of the effective tax rate, but we expect 38% for the full year.","Leslie Rich","Great. Thank you.","Marty Lyons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow up from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Hi. How's it going?","Warner Baxter","Hi Paul.","Paul Patterson","So just, you guys covered SB 190, but as you know, this has been going on for some time. Each legislative session, it seems like dej\u00e0 vu, we had a filibuster before. I listened to some of debate as you mentioned this session. But how should we think about the fact that, first of all I don't know whether or not constitutionally or rule wise, what have you, if the filibuster could be broken? But I mean, I don't know what the rules actually are associated with that. So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that? But I guess in the absence of that, how should we think about your legislative strategy, I guess, next year or what have you regarding this?","Warner Baxter","Paul, this is Warner. I will take a shot at it. Now, I will address both on them in terms of the bigger picture and sort of the dej\u00e0 vu comment as well as sort of filibuster. Number one, it may feel like dej\u00e0 vu, but I will tell you from my perspective, we have consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that will support investment. And I think what we have seen over the last two sessions has been that just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support, but also legislative support. And so of course, if it doesn't advances session, we are going to be disappointed.","But from my perspective, what we have done in the Missouri legislature working with our other utilities across the state is make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also those opportunities that those investments will create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw we come out of Senate Commerce Committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately as you rightly point out, we have had some challenges in avoiding the filibuster. And so in terms of the filibuster, there are two ways to address a filibuster or probably maybe three.","Number one, you try and minimize the number of folks that are willing to filibuster and from our perspective, that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, what you hope to do is try and find a compromise with those folks, but if not, then you need to be given adequate pour time to try and drive either negotiations or get something across the finish line. It's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur in other bills and frankly ultimately, sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is, a filibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on in the Missouri legislature. Last but that least, there are rules that the Senate has available to it that could help the debate on the bill.","But as we have said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But there are ways to address it. First and foremost, we try to do it in the constructive fashion and find good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody. So as we look forward then into the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, while we may be disappointed if Senate Bill 190 does not advance the session, we are not going to be deterred because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies.","They are in the best long-term interest for our customers and the entire State of Missouri. I think when you look at the work that we have done and the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms are truly driving customer benefits and creating jobs, those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately be passed in the State of Missouri. That's my perspective.","Paul Patterson","Okay. That's very helpful and very comprehensive. Just to make sure I understand personally because I don't want to monitor the thing forever. When you say that you would be disappointed, it sounds like you are not hopeful that it will pass, but do you think that there is a significant chance that it may pass still?","Warner Baxter","No. Well, Paul, what I said, we said it's unlikely. We have till May 12. So time is short. And so because of that I think it creates, it's very challenging for that Senate Bill 190 to get passed this legislative session.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But never say never, maybe.","Warner Baxter","You never say never. And we still, as I said also, that we are still trying to work on the constructive path forward with key stakeholders but the time is ticking.","Paul Patterson","And then just one final follow-up on the rate base growth question that I had about Illinois. Is there any quantitative number in terms of O&M or just cost savings in general that are associated with them that you have? I know you may not have off the top here, but I am just wondering if there is a rule of thumb that we should maybe be thinking about in terms of what might happen there in terms of, I don't know, smart meter lowering costs or what have you?","Warner Baxter","No. I don't know that there's really rule of thumb. If you look back at some of our prepared remarks today, you will notice some of the mention we gave to the improvement in reliability as well as some of the annual value that customers are realizing as a result of the broad infrastructure investments that we are making and we will continue to update those over time, Paul. I guess and I don't think I have a good metric for you and we will look at whether one of those exist, but clearly over time as we invest more in our smart infrastructure as we roll out more of our smart meters to our customers in Illinois, both the electric meters as well as the gas meter modules, we will provide continuing updates on the improvements that we are seeing in overall reliability and cost savings that we are bringing to the customers. And in the meantime, we will work with some of our folks in operations to see whether we can come up with some meaningful metrics that we might provide going forward in terms of the savings.","Paul Patterson","Great. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Kalton","Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call.","Warner Baxter","Hi Neil.","Neil Kalton","So really you answered most of my questions on SB 190and the last question or the last answer, but just a follow-up, I think your points are well taken that in the state, the legislative support, other support, something is this really strong. So what point in time, tactically, do you say maybe going down the legislative route we don't need to do that as much anymore and really look for solutions just going straight to the regulators themselves? Would that be something that you would rethink as we think about 2017 and 2018 and beyond?","Warner Baxter","Hi Neil. This is Warner. Look, the bottom line is that in moving policies forward, we consider both the legislative route and consider the regulatory route. You have seen us in regulatory, the rate cases advance policies that are within the tools that the Commission currently has. So that's always an option. But we also pursue the legislative option. And we think too clearly that that is a big good sustainable path as well. So there is no point of inflexion. There's no black or white line that let's you go through, to say here's the time. The point is, we factor a number of things into our thinking around that. But the most important thing is that we get it done for the State of Missouri and for our customers.","And Michael, you have some additional comments around this?","Michael Moehn","Well, I think the important thing associated with the legislative side is creating that consistency, right. I mean I think the uncertainty associated with the regulatory processes that you are looking for is some long-term investments to make and that's really what we see through the legislative process is giving us the window to do that. That's why we have been so focused on.","Neil Kalton","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Joe Zhou with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","Hi. It's Andy again.","Warner Baxter","Hi Andy.","Andy Levi","So I guess the points are kind of well taken on the legislation. So it just seems like that strategy is going to kind of work in Missouri and maybe it does but God only knows when. So on the regulatory front, what are you thinking there? I mean you have kind of backed off spending more money and allocating more money to Illinois, which obviously is the right strategy and not as much to Missouri. At the same time, you have got a pretty fair rate order. And we are also compensated for Noranda in the latest filings. And I guess there's been some workshops but over my career, workshops tend not always to be too much. What's the thinking now in Missouri CapEx wise, investment wise? Is it still kind of to not invest as much as you had planned? Or as much as maybe the legislation would have allowed? Or at some point do you decide to kind of go the more traditional route and start ramping up the investment there? And obviously there is regulatory lag, but also working with the Commission to try to, the words are eliminate that, but to kind of be able to work recover cost on a timely basis Missouri wise? I am not saying timely in general but just Missouri wise. So what's the thinking in that?","Warner Baxter","Andy, this is Warner. I will hit the highlights and certainly Marty and\/or Michael can join in. My view is that we are pretty clear about what our five-year plan is. I mean it's laid out there and clearly the compound annual growth rate from Missouri is what it is, it's laid out there in the slides, about 2%. And we feel very comfortable with that. And the strong robust plan, the 6% rate growth plan that we talk about is not contingent on regulatory reform in Missouri. But we have also said, if we have regulatory reform in Missouri, whether it comes through legislative means, whether it comes to regulatory means or a combination thereof, it will give us the ability to put more money to work in the State of Missouri and therefore enhance that investment profile. So I think that's really how I see it going forward.","Michael, any other comments?","Michael Moehn","Yes. That's right. Just want to be clear that we are investing to maintain safe and adequate service here in the State of Missouri. There's no question about that. We are missing an opportunity I think to modernize this grid. And what we are doing in Illinois today, I think, is a great example. But we are going to continue to stay after this. But just want to be clear about the investments that we are making today in the State of Missouri.","Warner Baxter","Absolutely right.","Andy Levi","I understand that. I mean obviously you are going to run the system the best you can. It's just a matter of modernizing the system to where other states are at right now. But you don't get to a point where, not because the system is not running well, don't misunderstand me, but where you decide, okay, the legislative route is not working. Obviously you are trying not only to run a really good system in this area, but also trying to make a point too without proper regulatory reform or treatment, it's very hard as a business to make those investments, especially when you have opportunities across the border in Illinois. So at what point do you decide to make those investments and I want to regardless or are you saying that you won't unless there is reform?","Michael Moehn","Again, this is Michael Moehn. I think it's looking for that certainly. I think you said it well. I mean, as we said before, we are maintaining safe and adequate service. We are allocating where we can in other jurisdictions today. We will continue to look at all tools that we have in front of us, legislative or regulatorily and if we see an opportunity, we will certainly take it, but it is that certainty that we are missing today and we have better opportunities. But again we are going to continue to invest where we have to maintain the system that customers are expecting from us.","Warner Baxter","So the bottom line, Andy, is, we feel comfortable with our plan.","Andy Levi","I know you do.","Warner Baxter","And we have been pretty clear.","Michael Moehn","So we are going to continue to stay at it because we think it's simply the right thing to do for our customers, for the State of Missouri and our shareholders.","Andy Levi","I mean, obviously, we like your story quite a bit. And you guys have done a very, very good job. But I guess at the same time, I could see some higher growth from Missouri, obviously that would enhance the growth rate of the corporation as well beyond the 6% through 2021. But I completely hear what you are saying. I mean, Missouri regulation is, again this is me talking, not the company, somewhat arcane in the way that they do things and makes it difficult, both on an investment basis as a investor and also for you guys as well. But okay. Thank you very much.","Warner Baxter","Thanks for your question, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fischer for closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating in this call.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of first quarter results and an update on financial and regulatory matters. We will then open the call for questions. Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday afternoon we announced first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in last year's first quarter. The earnings decline reflected more electric and natural gas sales volumes which were primarily due to milder winter temperatures. These milder temperatures lowered earnings by an estimated $0.10 per share compared to 2015.","The year-over-year earnings comparison was also reduced as a result of lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. In early January 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idled at two its three smelter pot lines as a result of an operational failure. And in mid-March Noranda idled its remaining smelter pot line. The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by a decrease in the effective income tax rate which was primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.","The earnings comparison also benefitted from increased earnings on FERC regulated transmission in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery service, resulting from infrastructure investments made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. Overall, our first quarter results were solid and we remain on track to deliver within our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.","Turning now to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe that we will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders.","I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this Slide. As you can see, we invested more than $300 million of our first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the supportive regulatory frameworks.","This represented almost two-thirds of our first quarter 2016 investments and included approximately $170 million of capital spent on FERC regulated projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers Transmission Project. Construction of the first of this project's nine line segments is now complete, with construction of three other segments and two of three river crossings expected to be completed later this year. Further, two of the project's 10 substations are already in service with construction well underway on the remaining ones.","For ATXI's Spoon River project in northwestern Illinois, we are currently acquiring right-of-way and plan to begin line construction later this year. In addition, the project's new substation is under construction and should be completed by the end of the year.","Finally, I am pleased to note that the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the Mark Twain project late last month. Moving forward, we plan to obtain assents from the five counties that Mark Twain will cross and to begin right-of-way acquisitions soon. All three of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO approved multi-value projects. When completed, these projects will deliver significant customer benefits including improved reliability and access to cleaner generation, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region.","Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $145 million in Illinois Electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These investments made under the company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and advanced metering goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades.","Since the program began in 2012, installation of storm resilient utility poles, advanced meters, outage detection technology and stronger power lines has resulted in 17% improvement in reliability. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 18% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advance electric meters are ahead of schedule. In 2016, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy at least 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters at customer locations in central and southern Illinois.","Also, from the beginning of 2012 to 2015, Ameren Illinois added more than 400 employees and more than 1100 contracted personnel in support of electric system projects under its modernization action plan. These benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois.","Turning now to Missouri where modernizing the regulatory framework has been a key area of focus. As we speak today, House Bill 2689, 21st Century Grid Modernization and Security Act remains on the Missouri Senate calendar and is available for further debate. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including that from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor suppliers, The Missouri Farm Bureau and many other key stakeholders.","In addition, this process has resulted in significant and constructive dialog with policymakers regarding the extent to which regulatory lag discourages investment in grid modernization. Unfortunately, the bill was subject to a filibuster by a small group of state senators during debate last week. It was not advanced at that time. Time is short for passage of this legislation as this year's general assembly session ends Friday. As a result, I do not believe that comprehensive performance based rate making legislation will be enacted this session.","However, this short window, we continue to work with key stakeholders to find other constructive paths forward this session. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing energy policies to address regulatory lag and support investment in aging infrastructure through both the regulatory and legislative processes. As a result and at this time, I do expect that we would support another legislative initiative next year. I am convinced those efforts are in the best long-term interest of our customers in the entire state of Missouri as we seek to modernize the grid to meet our customers future energy needs and expectations as well as create jobs.","As long as Missouri stands still, it is being left behind by other states who have adopted forward-thinking energy policies. In light of the fact that we do not expect comprehensive regulatory reform this session, coupled with the ongoing financial impacts of Noranda's outage, as well as increased investments and operating costs, we are moving forward with plans to file for an electric rate increase in early July. Moving from regulatory and legislative matters to a quick comment on Missouri operational matters.","Our scheduled 2016 nuclear refueling maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center was successfully executed and the plant is now back on line. We also continue our efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation.","Moving on to Page 7 in our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our peer leading rate base growth reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks. In addition, we stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect from 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda.","Our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. We also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility peers. Of course future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","To summarize, we are relentlessly executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I will now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year ago period. Key drivers of the earnings variance are listed on this page. Lower electric and natural gas sales volumes reduced earnings with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.10 per share decline. This temperature related earnings decline was almost entirely driven by lower electric sales volumes since Illinois gas sales are subject to a volume balancing adjustment effective at the beginning of this year.","This volume balancing adjustment ensures that changes in natural gas sales, including those from weather, do not result in an over or under collection of revenues from residential and small non-residential customers. First quarter 2016 temperatures were not only milder than those experienced in the year ago period, they were also milder than normal with heating degree days about 20% less than the year ago period and about 10% less than normal.","The remainder of the sales volume related earnings decline was almost entirely due to the idling of Noranda's smelter pot lines. Further, the carryover effect from Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan, reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Moving to the next key driver of the first quarter earnings variance. Last year's Ameren Illinois results benefited from recovery of certain cumulative power usage costs. The absence of this benefit had a $0.04 per share unfavorable effect on the earnings comparison.","Shifting now to factors that had a favorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. A decrease in the effective income tax rate, lifted earnings by $0.08 per share. This reduced tax rate was primarily due to recognition of 2016 tax benefits associated with share based compensation. These benefits were recognized in earnings pursuant to accounting guidance issued in March of 2016. I would note that that the level of such tax benefits to be recognized in future years will be a function of the fair value of share-based incentive awards when they vest and could cause our effective income tax rate to fluctuate above or below the approximately 38% effective tax rate normally expected.","For 2016, we now project the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. In addition, increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses, lifted earnings by $0.05 per share compared to the year ago period. I want to note that our ATXI and Ameren Illinois transmission earnings continue to be reduced by a reserve reflecting the potential for a lower MISO base allowed ROE, given pending complaint cases at the FERC.","In addition, the earnings of our Illinois electric delivery business incorporated an 8.7% allowed ROE under formulaic rate making compared to 8.6% for the year ago period. The Illinois electric delivery ROE reflected in first quarter 2016 results assumes an annual average 30-year treasury yield of 2.9% for the full year.","Moving to the last item on the page. Earnings for the first quarter also benefitted from higher Illinois natural gas delivery service rates effective at the beginning of this year, adding $0.04 per share. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for the first quarter.","Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois' industrial customers decreased approximately 8%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low margin Illinois customers, including those in mining agriculture, auto and steel making. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri's industrial customers were flat.","Turning to Page 10 of our presentation, now I would like to discuss our guidance for this year. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the a range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, despite several notable items that were not incorporated into our initial guidance provided back in February. These include one favorable item that was offset by three unfavorable items resulting in no change to our guidance range. The favorable item was the decrease in the first quarter effective income tax rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation which boosted earnings by $0.08 per share.","The three unfavorable items were, milder first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.05 per share compared to normal temperatures. An increase in the 2016 estimated earnings impact from lower sales to Noranda of $0.02 per share, as well as a 30 basis point lower assumed ROE for Illinois electric delivery service which reduced expected 2016 EPS by almost $0.02 per share.","The last item reflected the lower estimated average 30-year treasury rate for 2016 of 2.9%, which I mentioned a moment ago compared to our beginning of the year estimate of 3.2%. Regarding Noranda, our 2016 guidance includes an updated estimate of approximately $0.15 per share for the impact of lower electric sales to this customer compared to the prior estimate of $0.13 per share. As we discussed in February, this estimate is net of expected revenues from off system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under a provision of our fuel adjustment clause. This estimate has been updated for the regulatorily agreed upon method for calculating such off systems sales revenues and changes in forward power prices.","We continue to assume Noranda's production lines will remain idle for the rest of this year. I will not go through the balance of the year earnings consideration listed on this page, since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed each item on our February earnings call. Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course this goal will continue to be more challenging to achieve in Missouri, pending improvement in the regulatory framework. However, as Warner mentioned, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case in early July to recover costs related to additional infrastructure investments and rising expenses, including those related to net fuel, depreciation, transmission service and property taxes.","In addition, rates need to be adjusted to reflect the loss of sales to Noranda. As discussed in February, we expect the earnings impact of lower sales to Noranda to be temporary. Moving now to Page 11. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal [indiscernible] Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois. Last month Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois formula rate making, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such cost. Our filing seeks a $14 million decrease in annual electric rates. This net amount includes a $96 million increase reflecting 2015 actual costs, related carrying charges and expected 2016 infrastructure investments, which is more than offset by $110 million decrease due to recovery by year-end 2016 of previously under-recovered 2014 cost and related carrying charges.","The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with the decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I will remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points, and the ICC authorized equity ratio, and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC.","In the first case, the schedule calls for a final order from the FERC in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the second case, the schedule calls for an initial order from an administrative law judge by the end of June this year with a final order from the FERC expected next year.","Finally, turning to Page 12, I will summarize. We have affirmed our earnings guidance for 2016 and we continue to execute our strategy. Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers.","When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.5%, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your question.","Paul Patterson","Just with respect to the long-term earnings growth rate and your comments regarding the legislation and Noranda, I guess. You seemed like you are suggesting that Noranda might be a temporary situation and that you expect that it might change. I was just wondering, is Noranda in the long-term guidance. Noranda coming back that is, or how should we think about that?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Paul. This is Marty. You may recall when we gave the long-term guidance outlook back in February. We, number one, said we expected 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth from 2016 through 2020. The foundational element of that of course is the 6.5% rate base growth that we have which we showed from 2015 to 2020. But importantly when we talked about that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth, we were basing that off of an adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63. Obviously, if you took our guidance for this year, the midpoint is $2.50. But we added to that the impact we estimated at that time of the Noranda outage which was $0.13 at that time, to get to an adjusted midpoint of $2.63 and then base the earnings guidance off of that.","And the reason we did that is that we do believe the impact of Noranda's outage on our earnings to be temporary. And as we mentioned on the call, we do expect to file a Missouri rate case in early July of this year. We expect that that rate case will reflect the reduced usage by Noranda and as our rates are adjusted next year, than the temporary impact of this earnings decline from the outage would be erased. So that\u2019s how we expect it to go and so long-term in terms of our earnings growth guidance, Noranda maybe there and Noranda may not be there. We are not speculating on that but we do believe that through the rate case process that the impact of the outage will be mitigated.","Paul Patterson","Okay. That makes sense. And just in terms of the legislation as I recall, so your earnings growth rate is not dependent upon Missouri legislation getting enacted. Is that still the case?","Marty Lyons","Yes. That\u2019s absolutely right. We said that in February and we stand by that. You should know that the overall 6.5% rate base growth is the foundation. We have got about 2% growth forecasted for Missouri over that period of time. And we do believe both that rate base growth as well as our earnings growth expectation of 5% to 8% can be achieved without the need for legislation in Missouri.","Paul Patterson","How should we think about this tax benefit? I mean how do you still model it? It sounds like there was obviously a benefit this year but just in general, how do we factor in this new guidance associated with the taxes?","Marty Lyons","You know Paul, it's a good question. And I think going forward, continuing to think about that 38% effective tax rate is probably the right way to think about it. But to be aware that there could be some variation, up or down, from year to year, based upon this new accounting guidance. And as mentioned on the call, what it would really be a function of is what the fair value is of long-term share based compensation is at the time it vests, versus what's been reflected in book expense over the three years as it relates to our plans over the three year vesting period. And that can create a little bit of volatility in the effective rate. In this particular period as you see the value of what vested was greater than what had been recognized in expense over the past three years and therefore the tax benefit was greater than the effective tax rate reflected over the past few years. So we ended up with a benefit this year.","But as noted on the talking points, it could be a benefit or it could be a detriment. But I think in the absence of any further information, I think I would expect that 38% effective tax rate. As it relates to this year, that item had a discrete impact on the first quarter, so it lowered the first quarter effective tax rate. At the end of the year, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the tax rate, effective tax rate, to be around 35%, which would imply over the reminder of this year, in the remaining three quarters that effective tax rate somewhere between 37% and 38%.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just finally on the Mark Twain transmission ruling. There was this idea that you have to go back to the counties to get approval there, county consent. There was some discussion at the PSC that, that was going to probably lead to more litigation in the court system. I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on how you see that.","Maureen Borkowski","Maureen Borkowski. Yes, at this point in time, we are fully expecting just to go to each county and present the evidence. Really their statutory obligation in each county is to ensure that the transmission line doesn\u2019t have any impact on the user safety of public roadways. So we will put that packet of information together for each county and pursue getting their assent when we make that demonstration. So at this point in time we are not anticipating any additional litigation in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps following a little bit up on the last round of questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit on the specific differences in the statistics between Missouri and Illinois? You started off your remarks elaborating on Illinois but just how do the two compare? And then what are the tangible projects that would be on the table if you were to succeed either this year or next year under a new legislative framework?","Marty Lyons","Julien, this is Marty. Could you restate your first question? We are not clear what statistics you are referring to?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I suppose what are the reliability statistics? The differentials between Illinois and Missouri. Just to get a sense as to what do you aspire in to Missouri versus Illinois? And then, or perhaps to boot with that, what are the discrete and tangible projects that you are evaluating should you be able to get legislation this year or next year?","Warner Baxter","Paul, this is Warner. I think a couple of things. Number one, by and large Illinois has clearly made progress in improving the reliability as well as responding to outage duration as a result of the grid monetization project. By and large, what you are seeing between the two jurisdictions is that they are moving closer in terms of what their overall reliability and ultimate responsiveness to outages are. And so Illinois will continue to have specific metrics that they have to hit as part of the grid modernization act and they will continue to pursue that.","As part of the legislative effort in Missouri, there were specific performance metrics that are put out there as well for reliability in that that was in the legislation. I think importantly, what really we were focused on, we will continue to be focused on in Missouri, is to address the aging infrastructure. And so what are the kind of things that we would think about doing? Well, we would certainly be doing many of the things that you are seeing over in Illinois, investing in smart meters. Missouri needs to do that and it's an opportunity not just for our customers ultimately, to be able to use the more advanced meters. It's investing in a smarter grid, whether it be in the power lines, whether it be in automating much of the grid compared to where it is today. Substations, all these things are very important and things that we are doing in Illinois that we would be focused on doing in Missouri.","We had also, as part of the legislative effort, we would be looking at the generation portfolio. Clearly, we have aging infrastructure there and we could do improvements in a more timely fashion, we think in our generating power plants as well as invest in renewable energy which was a significant aspect of this bill. So we can put all those things together. These are things that we would be focused on in Missouri should we get legislation passed that would support that investment. And those are the kind of things that we are going to continue to talk about with policy makers, both the remaining part of this session as well as frankly moving into next year. Both during the rate case as well as preparing for the next legislative session.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then turning my attention to Illinois. Specifically here we've seen a lot of retirements in the last few weeks here. Can you comment at all where you are in the process of evaluating any requisite transmission upgrades?","Warner Baxter","Paul, we are going to have Maureen Borkowski, she can jump in. As we have seen some of these retirements, we think that there are some transmission opportunities and so Maureen, why don\u2019t you jump in and talk a little bit about some of those.","Maureen Borkowski","Yes. It's a little too early to be specific about what projects but process wise, when a generator applies to MISO to shut down even on interim basis, there is a study that\u2019s done by our transmission planners with the generator on our system to determine what the transmission needs would be to make sure the system can still operate reliably. So there is certainly the potential as these reported shutdowns are studied for additional transmission investment. And one thing I would point out is that because any needed investment here would be for reliability purposes, that would be outside of the competitive process and it would be Ameren's own companies that would be making any investment that was identified.","Warner Baxter","And so, Julien, I think I was saying Paul a moment ago. It's Julien. So I apologize for that. I am not sure Paul is not offended, hope that you are not as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I'm sure he isn't, nor am I. Last quick question on Missouri and the rate case. Any changes in the regulatory framework that you'd be seeking in this and also do you have any initial estimate on what the rate impact would be?","Warner Baxter","Julien, this is Warner again. I think a couple of things. It would be premature for us to say if we are going to do something special from a regulatory framework perspective. Every time we move into a rate case, we step back and say, okay, what from a policy perspective things that we want to pursue. So we will step back and think about that. And in terms of the overall rate increases, yes, it too is premature. You will see a lot of that here coming up very soon in early July. We will give you all the specifics as we move forward in the rest of the year, we will explain the case in more detail to you and the rest of our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions.","Paul Ridzon","You mentioned growth in Missouri of 2%. Is that EPS or rate base or both?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Paul. This is Marty. That 2% I was referencing was rate base. So overall we are expecting 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. In Missouri we expect it to be 2% compound annual rate base growth. So really not commenting specifically there on earnings but, overall, I would say that 6.5% rate base growth is sort of the midpoint of our long-term earnings per share growth guidance of 5% to 8%. So consistent with what we have talked about on prior quarters, I mean the bulk of that growth is coming in our FERC regulated transmission and our Illinois electric and Illinois gas distribution businesses, where we are allocating a significant amount of capital because of the constructive regulation we have in those jurisdictions.","Paul Ridzon","What's the [indiscernible] statutory deadline to adjudicate a Missouri rate case?","Warner Baxter","We have typically experienced 11 month resolution of the rate cases in Missouri.","Paul Ridzon","And then in February I think you indicated that you might pursue an accounting order of some sort for Noranda or other means to rectify the situation. Where does that stand? Or is it just going to be through a rate case?","Marty Lyons","Sure. No, good memory, good recollection. We laid that out there as one of the options that we would have in terms of ensuring this impact to be temporary. However, that\u2019s really not needed if the plan is to file a rate case. We will make the appropriate requests in the context of the rate case we filed in early July and therefore that accounting authority order would not be needed. So as we said on the call, that is our plan as we sit here today is to file that rate case in early July.","Paul Ridzon","So should we model in the $0.075 drag for Noranda in '17?","Marty Lyons","We hadn't give that but to your point, we said on our call today is we expect the impact to be about $0.15 this year. And just to give you an idea of how that breaks down, this year we expect, obviously we experienced in the first quarter about a $0.03 drag on earnings. We expect another $0.03 drag in the second quarter. $0.06 in the third quarter and then $0.03 again on the final quarter of the year in the fourth quarter. So through the first half of this year, about $0.06. To your point, Noranda was up and running to some extent in the first quarter, so I would say an impact in the order of $0.07, $0.06 to $0.07 in the early half of next year until we can get rates updated, is probably a fair assumption.","Paul Ridzon","And why is 3Q so heavily weighted? You have summer rates or...?","Marty Lyons","Yes. Noranda, and we talked about this at some length in our February call, Noranda has differential in rates. So between October and May of each year, the rate has been $31 and during per megawatt hour in June to September about $46. So they have had differential, I will call them winter and summer rates. And so there is a differentiated impact in those various quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felix Carmen with Visium Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","This is Ashar. Marty, one thing which I read in the queue which I was a little bit surprised was that the change in the FASC. Of course I knew there was some transmission earnings, I guess, that we don't get recovery on a timely basis, but you mentioned that in '16 that could be a gap of like $20 million. So as we file the case next year, is there some way that this gap can be minimized to zero or something to be changed? I'm trying to put that into my model. Is there some way that in this next case filing that this regulatory lag can be eliminated?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Ashar. What you are referring to in the queue, I believe, is that we actually layout what the amount was that was actually included in rates, when rates were set. And then contrast that with the transmission cost that we are actually experiencing in 2016. And so there is a differential there. The transmission costs have grown. During our last rate cast, transmission costs were renewed from recovery in the FAC. And that\u2019s an element of lag that we are experiencing. And so you would expect as we go to file this next rate case, that we would update our cost of service for the transmission cost that we are incurring. And through the rate case process you would expect that increased cost would be incorporated into the revenue requirement.","Ashar Khan","But my question is, is there some way - because I'm assuming the transmission costs are going to keep on going up. So is this going to be a repeat issue like a year after the next rate case we will again have under recovery, or is this just something which is happening this year? That's what I'm trying to kind of like gather.","Marty Lyons","You know Ashar, in the absence of a change in the regulatory framework or some mechanism to avoid that, there would be continuing drag on earnings or regulatory lag associated with that item. So that\u2019s something that certainly we will consider as we go into this next rate case, is how to deal with that. But, absolutely, at this point in time, it is not incorporated into the FAC. I would remind you, Ashar, that overall, we continue to work very hard to earn as close to our allowed return as we can. We have had that lag from transmission since the last rate case and we have been working hard to do what we can to find cost reductions in other areas. We mentioned in the guidance earlier this year that year-over-year as we move from '15 to '16, that we expect overall our operations and maintenance expenses to be down in Missouri and when you normalize for the Callaway refueling and remove the effect of Noranda, we expect to earn within 50 basis points for the allowed this year. So in isolation, absolutely, yes. That transmission, the increases in transmission costs are creating lag for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brian Russo","Could you remind us of the test year in the most recently concluded Missouri rate case?","Marty Lyons","Yes, I think it was -- you might look, I think it was in 2015, but I can't remember what the exact date was. I will let Doug maybe address it.","Doug Fischer","Yes. The test year was the 12 months ended March 31 of '15 but then a number of things were updated. And then a number of things were updated through the end of the year. Am I giving the year wrong there? '14, I am sorry. End of March '14 was the test year and then we updated for rate base and a number of items through the end of '14. And the rates went into effect in May of '15, late May.","Brian Russo","Okay. So I guess if we wanted to kind of calculate the incremental net plan that you will be seeking recovery of in the July rate case. Could we just, back in the envelope, take your year-end '14 and grow it by the 2% CAGR?","Marty Lyons","Yes. I think we would have to give that one some thought whether that simplified works or not.","Brian Russo","Got it. Okay. And I'm just curious, hypothetically speaking, what happens if you go through the Missouri rate case, you get new rates in effect to reflect the loss of Noranda sales and then Noranda resumes the plant? Is that just incremental excess sales and margin until your next rate case?","Marty Lyons","You know, I don\u2019t know but I would assume that to be the case. As we work through the rate case, maybe there will be clarity brought to that issue. But we wouldn\u2019t want to speculate that there would be some windfall that would be achieved as a result of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.","Andy Levi","Just two questions. Can you talk about M&A and in the context of Ameren as a buyer?","Warner Baxter","Andy, this is Warner. And so a couple of things. Just in general, as you know from a buyer perspective obviously if you look in the past, we have been a buyer of M&A. But as I have said before and continue to say, our policy has been really kind of, don\u2019t get into the specifics or comment on speculative transactions or M&A activities just in general. That\u2019s not very constructive but as you know, we have grown in the past two acquisitions. But to be clear, our current plan is focused on the plan that I laid out before, and it's on the organic growth in our regulated business. We plan to deliver strong earnings growth that I outlined and it's driven by the rate base growth, of course. And with our strong dividend we believe we will deliver the superior value to our shareholders and ultimately to customers too. And so M&As happen in our space, so that doesn\u2019t surprise us that there continues to be some level of consolidation. And in particular, we continue to be attentive to things going on our space like other companies. But whether we are buyer or anything, that probably takes it one step too further than just what we have done in the past.","Andy Levi","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then the second question I have is just regarding Missouri Commission. What's the thinking now since the legislation is not getting done that the commission may do some type of workshops this summer to maybe address some of the things in the legislation?","Warner Baxter","So Andy, this is Warner and I will ask Michael Moehn to speak up as well. I think that whether there is going to be a specific workshop, I don\u2019t think there has anything been decided in particular and that\u2019s always a possibility. But I don\u2019t think the commission has come out with a specific statement or ruling that they plan on doing that. Michael, I don\u2019t know...","Michael Moehn","I think that\u2019s right, Warner. I think the commission remains focused on trying to help deal with this regulatory lag issue and I think that that could potentially be an outcome to our work through this summer to help gain some additional support with respect to what we are trying to do here in Missouri.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your questions.","Paul Patterson","Just really quickly, I think you guys mentioned the potential for non-comprehensive legislation. In other words, you guys mentioned that you felt comprehensive legislation wasn't likely this session. I was wondering if that meant that there was maybe some other legislative opportunities that you do see potentially and if you could elaborate on that?","Warner Baxter","Sure, Paul. This is Warner. I guess a couple of things. Number one, the session, as I said, ends this Friday. So the reality is, time is very short. And while comprehensive performance based regulation legislation will not pass, at least from our perspective, it doesn\u2019t mean that we still don\u2019t have conversations with key stakeholders to see if we can some level of progress. It's probably not appropriate for me to speculate, frankly, to say what that may or may not look like. We will know in a few short days whether anything happens, but time is short and so while it may be difficult it doesn\u2019t mean that we are not on the table talking to the key stakeholders.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So stay tuned.","Warner Baxter","Stay tuned. It's a good way to put it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Steve Fleishman","Going back a while ago, the company used to talk about keeping the parent balance sheet pretty consistent with the utilities and particularly in Missouri that used to be a focus in terms of just making sure there's not a big difference there. Is that still something that you need to monitor and keep in balance or no?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Steve, this is Marty. I think still if you look at our, in the slides that we have got out there today, we look to keep a parent company cap structure around 50% equity. Today I think in our Missouri rates we have got a little north of 51%, Illinois about 50%. You know the transmission business depending on where it's at, [north] [ph] of 51% to 56%, with our hypothetical cap structure for ATXI. So we have over time tried to keep those all in the ballpark in the general vicinity of one another and generally keep strong balance sheets and solid credit ratings.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. But is that just a choice or is there, in Missouri, kind of a risk of some kind of imputation if you were to have a lot more parent or holdco leverage?","Marty Lyons","You know, I guess, Steve, I would say in Missouri we really haven't experienced any sort of look through kind of issue, if that\u2019s what you are getting at. I think over time in Missouri we have been able to demonstrate that the equity in the utility balance sheet hasn\u2019t been funded by any debt at the parent. So largely I would say it's by choice. We think it's good to keep all of those in genera alignment and like I said, keep a strong balance sheet. I don\u2019t think as you look around, in around the state, there is different historical practices in terms of use of the parent company balance sheet or utility specific balance sheet. But it seems more situational versus some bright line test or standard practice.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Doug Fischer, Senior Director of IR, for closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating in this call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Fischer, you may begin.","Doug Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com Web site homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.","As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued today and the forward-looking statements and risk factors sections in our filings with the SEC.","Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Doug. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our co-workers and contractors who volunteered to leave their families to work tirelessly in very challenging conditions to restore power for those we experienced outages due hurricanes impacting Texas and Florida.","I'm particularly thankful that all of our co workers returned home safely. The restoration efforts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma was just another example, the incredible team work and commitments our customers is so often displayed by our industry.","Further Ameren and our industry stand to support Puerto Rico and its hurricane restoration efforts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those families who lost loved ones, their homes or what otherwise impacted by these devastating storms.","Moving to our financial results, earlier today we announced third quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.24 per share compared to $1.52 per share earned in the third quarter of 2016. This year-over- year decline of $0.28 per share was largely driven by a $0.24 per share change and the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren electric distribution a matter which we highlighted earlier this year.","This $0.24 timing related decline and third quarter earnings will have no effect on full-year earnings, due to increase in revenue recognition in the first, second and fourth quarter of this year compared to last year. Marty will discuss this and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment.","I'm also please to report that we remain on-track to deliver strong core earnings result in 2017. This morning we announced that we narrowed our 2017 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share.","Moving to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan which we have been executing very well over the last several year. We remain focused on operating our businesses safely while strategically allocating capital and continue to exercise discipline cost management.","We expected this strategic capital allocation along with disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earnings close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdiction to result in solid long-term earnings growth. I'm happy to report that in 2017 we been successfully executing these key strategic actions across all of our business.","As you can see on the right side of this Page, during the first nine-months of this year, we invested nearly $1 billion or two-thirds of total capital expenditures and in our transmission and distribution businesses where investment are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair predictable and timely cost recovery.","Since our second quarter call, we achieved a couple of key milestones on the 100-mile, Mark Twain transmission mine, in North Eastern Missouri. To begin ATXI\u2019s proposed alternative route for this project which is nearly 100% co-located on existing mines of way has received all five required County essence for road crossings. This was an important accomplishment and required extensive collaboration with many key stake holders.","As a result of achieving this important milestone, in mid-September ATXI required a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain alternative route from Missouri Public Service Commission and we expect to receive a commission order in the first half of next year. There has been no change for the estimated $250 million project cost and the plan and service date remains late 2019.","Turning now to Page 6, we also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects. Through the end of September Ameren Illinois had installed 560,000 smart electric meters and 290,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to program to help them save on their energy bills.","We are working to deploy these meters to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. Additional investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas infrastructure and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrades substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system.","Moving to Ameren Missouri, as you know earlier this year, we achieved a constructive settlement in our electric rates review which favorably impacted our third quarter results. From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October after completing a breaker-to-breaker run of 514 consecutive days, the second longest run in Callaway\u2019s history. The outage is progressing safely, on schedule and on budget.","Shifting now to our legislative efforts in Missouri, we remain very focused on enhancing Missouri\u2019s regulatory framework to better support investment in its energy infrastructure. The growing body investments from across the country clearly shows that these modernized energy policies deliver significant long-term benefits to customers. Those benefits include a more reliable and smarter energy rates, a more secured rate to address potential cyber attacks and greater tools for customers to manage their energy usage.","During the 2017 legislative session, we presented a thoughtful and robust energy infrastructure plan that included an incremental $1 billion in investment over five years and up to $4 billion over 10 years. Of course, these investments would also create thousands of good quality jobs in the State of Missouri.","The proposed legislation also included other strong economic development provisions and consumer protections to keep our already low electric rates affordable and competitive in the future. These factors have resulted in strong bipartisan support in the legislature to modernized Missouri regulatory framework.","As a result, we are leveraging the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions and continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to chart a constructed path forward for our customers in the State of Missouri.","And as we noted earlier this year, we expect to support a legislative initiative in 2018 to modernize Missouri\u2019s regulatory framework for electric utilities. Legislation can be filed as early as December 1st with the 2018 session officially beginning January 3rd next year.","Turning to Page 7, Missouri\u2019s integrated resource plan. In late September, Ameren Missouri filed a new IRP with the Missouri PSC which it does every three years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs of our customers for the next 20 years and puts forward our preferred resource plan permitting those needs.","The 2017 IRP is consistent with our objective to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Further, the IRP outlines a significant step change in our renewable energy portfolio due to the advancement of technologies and improved economics.","Importantly, the IRP is consistent with the requirements of Missouri\u2019s Renewable Energy Standard, which requires Ameren Missouri to source at least 15% of retail customer sales for renewable energy resources by 2021 subject to a 1% average annual limit on customer rate impacts.","Our preferred plan cost of an addition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020 and 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. After careful assessment, we believe it is in our customer\u2019s long-term best interest for Ameren Missouri to own these new wind resources, which represents a potential investment of approximately $1 billion.","We have been working on this important undertaking for many months, we still have more work in front of us to successfully execute our preferred plan. We are still completing due diligence on certain matters and are in negotiations with several developers which will ultimately determine the source, location and cost for these projects.","We also recognized that the comprehensive tax reform proposal released yesterday included revisions to the current product tax credit rules for wind generation. We expect that the proposed changes to the PTC rules will be the subject of much discussion by policy makers and key stakeholders over the next several weeks.","While it remains uncertain whether these potential modifications to the PTC rules will be become law as well as tax reform in general, we will off course access the potential implications of these changes on our plan if any.","Ownership will also require Ameren Missouri to secure certificates of need from Missouri PSE for each location and as well as regional transmission organization interconnection agreements. We are excited about the customer and environment of benefits as well as the potential significant investments and growth opportunities outlined in our preferred plan.","As you know, we are very strategic when it comes to managing and financing that capital plan in order to deliver long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. As a result, we will carefully access our prospective infrastructure investment plans in the context of this potential $1 wind investment.","Our infrastructure investment plan does not include any expenditures for renewable energy. We will also carefully consider the best long-term financing plan for this potential investment. Of course, we remain committed to maintain a strong equity ratios and credit metrics at our utilities and on a consolidated basis.","We will also assess the best approach to recover the cost of and return on these potential investments in the Missouri's regulatory framework. One tool is across recovery of mechanism that is already included in the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. It is writer mechanism that is specifically designed to address the revenue requirement impacts resulting from complying with the Renewable Energy Standard.","The use of this writer mechanism would require approval by the Missouri PSC. It\u2019s premature to go into more detail on all of these matters at this time, however we plan to provide further updates to you during our year-end conference call in February 2018.","Before I move off this subject I would also note that Ameren Missouri has established CO2 emission reduction goals from its generation fleet of 35% by 2030, 50% by 2040 and 80% by 2050.","In summary, our integrated resource plan is a forward thinking plan that is a win, win, win for customers, the environment and our shareholders. Rest assured we are very focused on executing this important opportunity for all of our stakeholders.","Turning now to Page 8, and the current five-year plan. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included $10.8 billion of regulated infrastructure investment as well as 6% compound annual rate base growth from 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks.","To be clear, this plan does not include potential $1 billion investment in wind generation outlined in Missouri's IRP that I just discussed. It also does not include potential additional investments $1 billion over five years and up to $4 billion over 10 years that could be enabled by constructive Missouri legislation.","As we look at the future, the successful execution of our robust five-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021 is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond.","With this long-term view inline, we are already making significant investments in our Illinois electric and gas utilities that will position us for success, including those in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure due to supportive regulatory frame works. And as we have mentioned, we have identified similar significant Missouri Grid Monetization investments, we would undertake with improvement in the Missouri regulatory framework.","Bottom line that we are taking steps today, across the board to position Ameren for success in the next decade and beyond and we believe we have a strong high-quality and sustainable pipeline investment opportunities that would benefit customers, communities we serve and shareholders.","Turning now to Page 9 to conclude my remarks. In February we affirmed our expectations for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance mid-point we outline early last year.","This was driven by robust 6% compounded annual rate base growth from 2016 to 2021. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth outlooks to be attractive compared to our a regulated utility peers.","Ameren also continues to offer investors a solid dividend, last month Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions.","To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend firmly providing yield of approximately 3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I'm firmly convinced that doing so we will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.","Again thank you all for joining us today and I will now turn the call over to Marty. Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Warner and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year ago quarter.","Excluding the third quarter 2017 non-core non-cash charge of $0.06 per share at the parent company for the reevaluation of deferred taxes, Ameren reported third-quarter core earnings of $1.24 per share. This charge was the result of an increase in Illinois corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% effective July 1st of this year.","Beyond this charge we do not expect tax increase to have a material prospective impact on consolidated earnings. Finally as you can see on this page there was no difference between GAAP and core results from last year's third quarter.","Turning on Page 12, on this page we highlighted by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0. 28 per share decrease in core earnings. Starting with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third-quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.26 per share driven by a $0.24 per share change in the timing of interim period, revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act.","This act modified the existing formulaic rate making by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change is impacting quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full-year earnings. The effects of decoupling also eliminated weather impacts in 2017. As a result, comparable earnings were down $0.02 per share as 2016 results benefited from warmer than normal summer temperatures.","Finally Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third quarter 2017 earnings benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 8.7% compared to 8.3% for the year ago quarter.","Next, Ameren Missouri third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.02 per share reflecting lower electric retail sales primarily driven by milder summer temperatures. The absence of the 2016 performance incentive award for the 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency plan and higher depreciation expenses.","These and other factors were mostly offset by new electric service rates effective April 1st, which increased earnings $0.15 per share. The new rates were driven impart by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter.","Turning to Ameren Transmission. Third quarter year-over-year earnings were comparable, the positive impact of increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic rate making were offset by a lower average allowed return on equity of 10.8% in 2017 compared to an average of approximately 12.3% in the year ago quarter.","In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15 months refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. This temporary benefit ended in September 2016 when the FERC adjusted MISO\u2019s base ROE to its current level.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois distribution for the first nine-months of 2017 compared to the first nine-months of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency program under MEEIA.","We exclude MEEIA affects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. These sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap-day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were also flat excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shutdown operations during the first quarter of 2016.","Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency while kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales to a large low margin processor of agricultural products.","Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter the cost, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.","Moving to Page 13 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we narrowed our GAAP guidance range to $2.67 to $2.81 per share, which includes third quarter non-cash tax related charge of $0.06 per share, which I discussed earlier.","Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share, reflecting continued solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the last three months of this year.","Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that will affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2017 core earnings to last year's fourth quarter results. Some of the larger impacts included change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois\u2019 Electric Distribution business of fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, and the 2017 Missouri electric rate review settlement.","Before moving on I would like to mention that we expect Ameren's Illinois to issue long-term debt before the end of the year to repay $250 million of maturing to 6.125% senior secured notes and refinance to short-term debt.","Moving now to Page 14 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Ameren Illinois is supporting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement in its required annual electric distribution rate update filing consistent with the ICC\u2019s stats file testimony. And ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.","Turning to the FERC, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI remains pending. These FERC regulated businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and they will continue to do so pending the outcome of this case. While quorum has been reestablished at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule.","In addition in September, the MISO transmission owners including Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a motion to the Smith the second complaint case maintaining that the current base ROE of 10.32% ordered by the FERC in the first complaint case has not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable.","Further the MISO transmission owners believe the second complaint should be dismissed because the approach used by the complainants to argue that the ROE was unjust and unreasonable was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit in the New England case. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order on the motion to dismiss.","Facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling in the New England case as well as the MISO transmission owner\u2019s recent motion as both may influence the FERC's order in the pending second MISO ROE complaint case.","Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation and potential federal income tax reform. Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform because we believe that lower corporate tax rates would drive economic growth and job creation benefitting our customers the communities we serve and other key stakeholders.","We will continue to advocate for tax reform that would benefit stakeholders and that appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. Earlier this year, on our February earnings conference call, we shared with your perspectives on potential financial considerations and impacts associated with tax reform elements under consideration at that time.","As you know yesterday Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives released a new comprehensive income tax reform proposal. Ameren along with our industry colleagues is still the process of reviewing this proposal, while the debate on tax reform took another step forward yesterday the timing and elements of tax reform if ultimately successful remain uncertain.","We will remain actively engaged with our industry colleagues on this important policy matter in the weeks ahead. That said, regardless of whatever federal income tax law changes may be made it is important remember their operations are fully rate regulated, we have limited parent company data and we have a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities that can deliver strong long-term benefits for customers and shareholders.","Turning to Page 16, we plan to provide 2018 earnings guidance when we release fourth-quarter results in February of next year, however using our 2017 guidance as a reference point we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year.","Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our foot regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formulaic ratemaking. Ameren transmission earnings would of course be affected by any change to the current allowed ROE of 10.82%.","For Ameren Illinois electric distribution service earnings are expected to benefit in 2018 compared 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formulaic ratemaking.","The allowed ROE will be of course the average 2018, 30 year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition Illinois gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state\u2019s gas Infrastructure writer.","For Missouri 2018 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter of next year by increased Missouri electric service rates that took effect April 1, 2017.","In addition, we expect the absence of expenses associated with our fourth quarter 2017 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to 2017. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2019.","Further a return normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017 results to-date assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year and we expect lower interest expense driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. Finally we expect Missouri 2018 results to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation transmission and property tax expenses.","Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share as we continue to successfully execute your strategy, As Warner stated, as we look ahead we continue to expect strong earnings-per-share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management.","And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. In total, we believe we offer investors an attractive total return story compared to our regulated utility peers.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning guys. Sorry to have missed this, but you went over the sales growth for Missouri and Illinois I think was 1% weather adjusted and leap year adjusted for Illinois year-to-date is that correct?","Marty Lyons","Let me go over that again Paul just overall. We talked about for our Missouri weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial were about flat, excluding the impacts of our energy efficiency programs. We have seen a little bit of growth there offset by as you know we had the leap-day benefit last year was overall flat there. Also in industrial class in Missouri it was pretty flat as well.","Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial was actually down about 1%. As you know we increased the energy efficiency efforts this year and I think that\u2019s been reflected in those lower sales and then Illinois industrial was down about 4%.","As we noted on the call, it\u2019s certainly important to remember that in our Illinois service territory, we are fully decoupled today based on the passage of the law last December where we increased our energy efficiency effort we also had decoupling and associated with that. So those sale declines are not affecting the bottom line result.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And just back to of Missouri, the flat numbers were inclusive of your energy efficiency efforts and leap-day and weather, correct?","Marty Lyons","That\u2019s correct Paul. All those stats I gave you to are for the nine-months year-to-date. In terms of Missouri which you asked about specifically, we are actually seeing some positive this quarter in terms of growth in both residential and commercial customer accounts so that\u2019s nice about 0.5% residential and almost 1% in commercial. So we seen a little bit of growth there and we look at the economies of course as, you see now this morning I think nationally the unemployment number came out at 4.1%.","We have been staying a little actually south to that a little better than that in Missouri unemployment at 4% and who knows maybe even a little bit less given the announcement today that nationally had moved down. And the Illinois unfortunately has been a little higher closer to 5%. So, but overall, I would say the unemployment has followed national trends and I would say overall the economies in both states are fairly stable.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And then Warner, you made some comments about the legislation being introduced, I guess it\u2019s early as December perhaps, I\u2019m sorry again if I missed this. But I guess what timeframe are you guys thinking of your legislation being impacted and then also as I recall there was a PSC proceeding in Missouri just sort of look at things sort of like what you guys are talking about on legislation, has that concluded and I apologize, but was there anything significant out of that. I apologize for not being\u2026","Warner Baxter","No worries. Always we will have [indiscernible] in Missouri. I will comment on the timing of legislation and I will look that Michael made the comment on the proceedings that are going on in Missouri looking at some forward-looking things from the regulatory perspective.","Big picture, we have not set a specific time in terms of when legislation would ultimately introduced. We are very focused to try and get working with key legislators to get legislation pre-filed for the legislation starts. Pre-filing can begin as early as December the legislature opens on January 3rd.","So we don\u2019t have a specific date, but we have been working hard over the summer with our key stakeholders with our partners to put ourselves in as good position as we possibly can to move forward and so we would expect to file legislative or support a legislative initiative in 2018. So Mike do you want to touch on some of the other proceedings going on Missouri?","Michael Moehn","Sure, absolutely Warner. also I think but we are going to continue build off a good work that we made - progress that we made at the end of the sections last year and specifically with perspective of the initiatives in Missouri, I think you are referring to there was in interim Senate Committee as well as the PSC put some workshops on to really look at these regulatory reform issues and those both have concluded I would say in general they were pretty positive and supportive of what we are trying to do in varying degrees, but overall supported the idea of modernizing degree of the benefit for customers and the need for some regulatory reform in the state of Missouri to make that happen.","Paul Patterson","But can the PSC do anything on its own now. I mean I thought they were maybe looking at perhaps changing some of their own processes just administratively for the speakers appose to requiring legislation and do something. Is there anything possible on that end might happen?","Michael Moehn","I think the PSC does have the ability to make some - certainly administrative changes to the overall regulatory process to try to help facilitate that. I think that they were also advocating for some legislative changes as well to give themselves to more tools which gave us really more certainty at the end of the day to make these kind of needed investments.","Warner Baxter","Mike we made comment on the PSC, they are doing some workshops on some forward thinking regulatory policies around electric vehicles and those types of things perhaps Paul has heard a little bit about that. Just maybe you can talk about some of those things which are taking place which that is what the PSC has initiated on their own.","Michael Moehn","Right and that's really around these emerging technology workshops that they kicked off, and Warner is right, I mean that's really looking at the benefits of electrification and modernizing the grid, which again I think all of this points back towards so needed changes within the regulatory structure to promote some of these kind of investments and again I think that they point to some things from the legislative standpoint that could occur as well, you are right, I mean I think they have some tools available to do some of these things also.","Paul Patterson","Okay great. Well it will be the last question. Thanks a lot.","Warner Baxter","Thank you Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Assuming that tax reform doesn\u2019t pass with your wind projects are you set-up to have a 100% PTC do you have access to Safe Harbor turbines?","Marty Lyons","Yes Paul this is Marty Lyons. As it relates to that we have been in the process of negotiation with developers and those negotiations are ongoing and part of that is determining that in fact the developers have done what necessary to make sure that we are eligible for the PTC and that\u2019s a key part of diligence efforts as part of this going on in tandem with the negotiations.","Paul Ridzon","And then you talked about potential billion dollars, if you this were to come fruition would that will be additive to your current plan or would it kind of displace some other capital?","Marty Lyons","Well the current plan is at which we make pretty clear in the slides, the current plan did not incorporate any investment in renewable, so there was no spending in the current plan for these renewable. So in that sense the billion dollars would be additive to that. Now as Warner talked about in his prepared remarks.","What we would do is step back, valuate our overall five-year infrastructure investment plan in a context of that incremental wind investment and we would expect them to present probably in February of next year, what our four or five year capital plan looks like.","Paul Ridzon","You mentioned potentially financing 250, what term do you think you will put on that and refinance it.","Marty Lyons","I don't know it\u2019s an Ameren NOI offering typically we are looking out at 10 or 30 years of offerings.","Paul Ridzon","And then your 18 drivers you mentioned potential other refinancing, do you have a sense of how big in timing on that","Marty Lyons","I think as we look out 2018 we did mentioned a couple of refinancing opportunities. There are a couple maturities in Missouri that we were specifically speaking of, I think they total something like 350ish million dollars over the course of next year. So we would be looking at opportunities to refinance those maturity, so I think there are two separate maturities that add up to about that number.","Paul Ridzon","Do you have a ballpark coupon in this.","Marty Lyons","I do not at this time.","Paul Ridzon","And then just on legislation obviously you have gotten I would say to one guide line before, how you are making progress with the parties that could total buster.","Warner Baxter","So Paul this is Warner, I will comment briefly, as I said before, there has been a lot of work down here when I call the off season with the host of stakeholders, and so the conversations continue to be constructive and we try to make sure those that had opposition that we reach out to them to get their input.","And so it's ongoing and we are very focused to leverage as Michael said a moment ago, the really strong bipartisan support that we have in both the House and the Senate as well as the stakeholders across the state that moves something forward that\u2019s in the best interest of our customer, and certainly the communities we serve and certainly our shareholders. So there is still move work to be done and the team is hard at it, as well as working with our partners across the state.","Paul Ridzon","Sounds like you are making some progress. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","Hi good morning how are you guys doing? Just to understand the Missouri kind of clean energy initiatives, though to this is made to meet that, I was just curious if for whatever reason this House bill were two end up being law, PTC was changed as written that bill. How does that work, I mean obviously I understand the economics of it, but you still have to meet that standard, is that correct?","Warner Baxter","We do. You are referring to the Renewable Energy Standard in Missouri. I think something to be mindful of within that standard, I mean there is a 1% cap on customers as well that we also have to balance in all of this making sure that we comply and so I mean obviously that\u2019s something that we will be mindful of as we work through this and be mindful of these proposed changes in the tax law.","Andy Levi","Okay. So how do you kind of - again whether the log really becomes law or not, a lot of people say it\u2019s doubtful, but if it were, how do you work around this, have you thought about it I mean it\u2019s only been a day?","Warner Baxter","Andy, this is Warner. Look I think the legislation or the proposal to be clear is 24 hours old. And so we assess this and as I said in my prepared remarks, I sense that this particular provision will get a lot of attention over the next several weeks from key stakeholders from across the country, but we are still assessing it ourselves.","And so, the only thing as I said during our talking points is that we understand that the real benefits to customers, the environment and shareholders as a result of this plan, so we are very focused on it.","And so we are going to work very hard to get out arms around this potential proposal as well as looking at the existing law within the State of Missouri and also be mindful that you know it is our desire to transition our generation portfolio to clean and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.","All those things come together and we expect them as things move on to be able to give a more comprehensive update on all these things certainly in February when we have our year end conference call and give you a more forward looking outlook for the next five years.","Andy Levi","Okay. And I guess we talked about more of the next week too when we see it, but the second thing is to just understand on the drivers for 2018. If I kind of do the math correctly and then you kind of maybe net out the property taxes and depreciation that doesn\u2019t flow through Illinois on the formula rates. Is there about $0.30 to $0.30 plus of upside everything else equals that right.","Marty Lyons","It\u2019s Marty. Obviously, we are not giving specific 2018 guidance. I think\u2026","Andy Levi","I know. I think on the drivers that you gave.","Marty Lyons","Yes. If you look to Slide 16, I think that you will see that we gave a number, important drivers to think about as you think about 2018 and probably we aren\u2019t going to go much beyond that, but I think we have given you some really good specificity to hook into. Obviously we have got this increased investment in Ameren Transmission.","The rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from 2.5 billion to 2.9 billion next year. Andy as you know a little uncertainly around what the ROE will be next year, right now we are earning 10.8 and that we will see the FERC rules on the second complaint case and how they rule. We have got higher rate base expected next year in Ameren Illinois electric which is subject to formulaic rate making. The third year treasuries did rise over the course of this year.","We will see what happens over next year, gas distribution business while we don\u2019t have a rate case next year we do get to formulaic adjust rates based on our writer there, since formulaic way we get to adjust rates based on a writer there for infrastructure investments. About 50% of our CapEx qualifies for those adjustments so that's a boost.","And then we do get a little carryover the next year from the rate increase that went into effect in Missouri this year in April, so we will pick-up the first quarter benefit next year which we quantified on Slide 16, which is no Callaway refueling outage next year that's off course $0.08. We have had some negative weather this year, we have had about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year, if we raise that next year and go to normal that's another $0.06 pick-up.","And then as you mentioned, there is some other things pluses and minuses, we expect lower interest, we talked about that on the last call if any refinancing that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings. Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some refinancing next year, I think the exact amount for next year is something like 380 million of Missouri refinancing.","I didn\u2019t provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt with respect to the coupon from the debt we are replacing that\u2019s in one case 5.1% in other case 6%, so we will be refinancing that whatever the prevailing rates are at the time.","And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we have provided I think a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018.","Andy Levi","And then just to follow-up on that so when you give 2018 on the fourth quarter call I guess these pluses right and whatever minuses, but the incremental earnings that will be based on your weather or normalized earnings in 2017, so whatever that is if it's X it will be X plus this is that kind of the way to look at it?","Marty Lyons","Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. I think typically when we think about our growth, we don\u2019t always strip out whether to base the growth on, but yes I think I'm not sure exactly how you are thinking about it, but yes you look at weather normalized 2017 and then you see things to build and consider again whether there were any sort of one-time impacts in 2017 that you wanted to take into consideration besides weather.","Andy Levi","Okay. I will see you at Slash Mountain on Saturday night okay.","Marty Lyons","Terrific Andy, I appreciate you calling in. enjoy yourself.","Andy Levi","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Fallon","What is the actual approval process for the Missouri when that you guys have proposed, do you have to get the IRP approved and then there is another stage just how do you do that?","Warner Baxter","Michael why don\u2019t you take that question please.","Michael Moehn","Absolutely. So yes there is no formal approval process for the IRP itself. I mean there is a review that occurs and people are real common et cetera. In terms of the specific wind projects we do have to file what's call the Certificate of Convenience and Necessity here in the Missouri at CCN. We foresee filing it probably in the first half of 2018 that process is really then you have folks come through and intervene et cetera and so that's ultimately the approval process that occurs, so that you feel good about going forward with the project.","Kevin Fallon","Okay, and Warner in your comments I think you mentioned something about writer recovery is that how you are looking to move from the CCN to the actual build phase.","Warner Baxter","So also as part of that CCN filing, we will make an application to use this writer mechanism that's also outlined in the law and so that would be as part of that certificate process that I discussed.","Kevin Fallon","So you are going to\u2026","Marty Lyons","I'm sorry, it\u2019s important to understand, this writer mechanism doesn\u2019t require formal rate case, it\u2019s a writer mechanism outside the general rate case, just that how the provisions of that works.","Kevin Fallon","Exactly, so you guys are going to have clarity on recovery before you actually commit the capital, is what I'm asking.","Warner Baxter","Correct.","Kevin Fallon","Okay and the other thing in just terms of modeling for the FERC jurisdictions into next year, until you have an order, we should assume that you are going to continue to book at our 10.82%.","Marty Lyons","That\u2019s correct we will continue to book at 10.82 until we get an order that tells us to do otherwise.","Kevin Fallon","Okay and then you guys highlighted additional CapEx that\u2019s tied to potential legislation, in terms of the financing going forward, should we use like an FFO to debt target or consolidated equity target, or just color on how we should assume the finance side if it comes about.","Marty Lyons","Yes, I think it's not probably a clear bright line that I tell you Kevin, I mean I think what we will do with whether we have additional CapEx due to the integrated resource plan or we having additional CapEx due to other legislative efforts or other factors, we will step back and will take a look at the overall infrastructure investment plan, we will step back and we will take a look at the overall cash flows associated with the business and then assess the best way forward to finance that.","As I Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the all credit metrics, credit ratings at the parent company at the holding companies, the consolidated equity ratio, cash flow metrics and how best to position I would say these incremental investments to for regulatory recovery and make those additive to shareholder value.","So we will take all of those factors into consideration and then think about the best path forward for financing those. Clearly as I think you mentioned in the your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we have laid out earlier this year given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to financing that plan.","Kevin Fallon","Exactly so when you update capital on the fourth quarter call this is a component of as well whatever you guys ultimately decide to do.","Warner Baxter","Yes, I think as we role forward with for you updated prospective CapEx plans, you should expect that we will offer you comments as well as on how we would plan to finance that overall infrastructure investment plan and related cash flows.","Kevin Fallon","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Emami with Verition Fund Management. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","Hi this is Ashar, how you are guys doing. Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good. I just wanted to clarify one thing, Marty, so what ROE we did we book on the transmission side for 2017, is it also 10.82.","Marty Lyons","Yes, so in 2017 we have been recording the 10.82, last year we actually had a temporarily higher ROE, so I think if there was any confusion, I would say that year-over-year earnings in the third quarter on the transmission segment were relatively flat. We got the benefit of the increased infrastructure investment, but we had a comparatively lower ROE, because we went from an average of the 12.3 ROE in the third quarter of last year to the 10.8 that we have got this year.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So then as we monetize the growth from 2017 and 2018 based on facts we have right now there is going to be no change in ROE right as you book for 2018 versus 2017, correct?","Marty Lyons","The answered earlier in a question Ashar, we will continue to book 10.8 until such time as the FERC would tell us to do otherwise. So as you know, there is the second complaint case that\u2019s outstanding, the ALJ in that particular case ruled that we should perhaps move down from 10.8 overall ROE which includes the 50 basis points at or down to 10.2 with the 50 basis points at or.","As we said on the call, we have made filings to suggest that second complaint case should be dismissed for the reasons we discussed on the call and it\u2019s uncertain when the FERC even though they have got a quorum now will rule on the second complaint case. So until that time that they do rule and until such time as they would tell us to change the ROE we will continue to book to 10.8.","I would mention that for about 15 month period after the second complaint case was filed, we did accrue our reserve of about $40 million for the potential that the ROE would be lower to 10.2 and that we would need to refund that money. So we have got that reserve set out to the extent of the FERC could rule consistent with the ALJ, but as I mentioned again it is uncertain what the FERC will do actually at this point in time.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Fair enough. And then Marty, I just if I heard you correctly I apologize I was listening to a couple of other things simultaneously, you said that there was 15 million of interest savings from the financings from this year 2017 which would flow through to next year, did I hear that correct?","Marty Lyons","Well, we did a partial savings this year as it relates to that and then we will get the full benefit next year, so year-over-year you wouldn\u2019t get the full uptick from the 15 million, but just highlighting that earlier this year we did refinance some debt at Ameren Missouri that produced annual interest savings of 15 million and then also mentioned that as we look into next year there are couple of other opportunities as we sit here today to incrementally do some refinance.","Ashar Khan","Incrementally. And could I assume new issuance costs around 3.5 or something like that or something in that ballpark between three and 3.5 would fair based on current market conditions?","Marty Lyons","That might be fair. Again, I declined to comment on specifically we will issue - we will between now and then consider what the best tenure is for an Ameren Missouri offering, given our debt latter and other considerations and obviously price is based on the market conditions at that time.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Thank you so much.","Warner Baxter","Thank you Ashar.","Marty Lyons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fischer for any closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of second quarter results and an update on financial and regulatory matters. We will then open the call for questions. Before Warner begins I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today\u2019s call including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Doggie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced second quarter 2016 core earnings of $0.61 per share compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in last year\u2019s second quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales to Noranda Aluminum driven by warmer early summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC regulated transmission and Illinois Electric Distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks to better serve our customers.","These favorable items were partially offset by expenses for the 2016 scheduled Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage as well as lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year Noranda idled production at its smelter and the plant remains shutdown. Overall our second quarter results were solid as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that we have raised our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, reflecting year-to-date results.","Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to take a moment and highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. To begin our accomplishments include continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks to provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers.","This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this slide. As you can see, year-to-date, we invested almost $650 million of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost two-thirds of our year-to-date 2016 investments and included approximately $330 million of capital spent on FERC regulated transmission projects. The largest of these is ATXI\u2019s $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project\u2019s nine line segments is complete with construction of three other segments and two of three river crossing is well underway. Further two of the project\u2019s 10 substations are already in service with remaining eight under construction.","For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are acquiring the balance of the write away and we plan to begin line construction later this year. As for the Mark Twain project we are in the process of obtaining a sense from the five counties this transmission line will cross and have begun right of way acquisition. All three of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved multi value projects. When completed they will deliver significant customer benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.","Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $320 million in Illinois Electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first six months. These include investments made under the Company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on-track to meet or exceed its investments, reliability and smart meter goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages due to our smart grid investments. In addition natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are improving the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system.","Turning now to Missouri, first on May 10th, we safely completed the 21st nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center ahead of schedule. In addition, Ameren Missouri continues to aggressively manage those costs that are under its control. Our success in this area has helped maintain electric rates that are the lowest of any investor owned utility in Missouri and are well below the Midwest and national averages. While we're taking actions to keep our electric rates among the lowest in the country, we also need to take action to begin recovery of energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates.","As a result in early July Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission or PSC for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue. This request included recovery of and a return on the new infrastructure investments I just mentioned including those from nuclear safety, environmental controls, transmission line improvements and reliability. In addition, the filing includes recovery of fixed cost related to the loss of sales to Noranda as well as increased MISO transmission charges. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this proceeding in late April of next year. Marty will discuss this rate filing further in a moment.","Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know comprehensive performance based ratemaking legislation was not enacted by the Missouri General Assembly before its session ended in mid-May, as a result of a filibuster by a small group of state senators. Since then two separate efforts have been initiated by the state to address the need for regulatory reform to support investments in Missouri Energy Infrastructure. One of these efforts is an undertaking of the Missouri PSC and the other is the work of a Senate Interim Committee. Stated purpose of the Missouri PSC's effort is to consider policies to improve the way in which the commission regulates Missouri\u2019s investor owned electric utilities. And the stated objective of the Senate Interim Committee is to evaluate ways utility regulatory process in Missouri might be modernized in order to ensure sustained investment in utility infrastructure while at the same time promoting interest of fairness among all constituencies including customers and shareholders.","We're pleased and we're certainly appreciate that the Missouri PSC and the senate interim committee are taking the time and effort to study this important issue. I am convinced that improvements to Missouri's regulatory framework are in the best long-term interests of our customers and the entire state of Missouri as we seek to implement a smarter grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio as well as create jobs. We've filed comments with the Missouri PSC and we will be actively engaged in both proceedings this summer and fall. In addition we continue to engage with other key stakeholders involved in the process to explore constructive paths forward to support investment in Missouri's aging infrastructure.","As I wrap up my business update I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our co-workers who have maintained their relentless focus on executing our strategy which is enabling us to deliver safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers and the communities we serve. Our actions have included working under challenging and hot operating conditions in the field and in our energy centers, responding to our customers' needs in a timely manner when faced with periodic summer storms, using innovation to meet our customers' rising expectations as well as making our operations even more efficient and most importantly doing all of these things with safety being at the top of their mind.","Of course we're not done, looking ahead we will be relentless in our efforts to improve our operating and financial performance including maintaining our strong focus on safety as well as exercising disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation, and we will continue to focus on meeting and exceeding our customers' energy needs and expectations, and ultimately delivering superior long-term value to you, our shareholders.","Speaking of delivering and superior value to our shareholders I will now move to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February we outlined our plan to grow rate base in an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our above peer average rate base growth plan reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks, now rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations.","We stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5 to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. We also remain focused on delivering a solid dividend, because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility peers. Of course future dividend increases will be based on consideration of among other things earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. Our strong earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend results in superior total return opportunity for our shareholders.","To summarize we continue to successfully execute our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so would deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and now I'll turn the call over to Marty. Marty?","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner and good morning everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation, today we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for this year\u2019s second quarter.","Moving then to Page 10, here we highlight factors that drove the $0.03 per share increase in second quarter 2016 results compared to prior year core results. In 2016 we experienced higher retail electric sales volumes excluding sales to Noranda driven by warmer early summer temperatures. These temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share versus 2015 and $0.06 per share versus normal conditions.","Moving to the next key driver of the second quarter earnings variance, increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the year ago period and net of changes in returns on equity. Our Illinois electric distribution business results incorporated an 8.45% allowed ROE under formulaic rate making compared to 8.75% for the year ago period, based on an assumed average of 30 year treasury rate of 2.65% for the full year.","Moving to the next two items on the page, earnings for the second quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas distribution service rate effective this year as well as a decline in other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers, regulatory trackers or formulaic rate each adding $0.02 per share compared to the prior year period.","Shifting now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison, the scheduled 2016 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage reduced second quarter 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2015 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling that scheduled for the fall of next year. The previously mentioned idling of Noranda smelter pot lines reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. And finally the quarter-over-quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri\u2019s 2015 energy efficiency plan negative affected the earnings comparison by $0.04 per share.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date. Overall, we experienced sales trends similar to those discussed on our first quarter call. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 5% primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low margin Illinois customers, including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. Excluding lower sales to Noranda kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down one half of 1%.","Turning to Page 11 of our presentation, now I would like to move from this discussion of sales to our guidance for the full year. As Warner stated we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This increased guidance reflects solid year-to-date results including a first quarter tax gain associated with the new accounting rule and an estimated $0.01 per share first half weather benefit compared to normal as warmer than normal second quarter temperatures more than offset milder than normal first quarter temperatures.","Regarding Noranda, we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of lower electric sales to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2016. This estimate is net of expected revenues from off system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under a provision of our fuel adjustment clause, we continue to expect Noranda's smelter to remain idle for the rest of this year and that this will reduce earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods.","I will not go through the other earnings considerations listed on this page because they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed them on our February earnings call. Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course we're falling short of this goal in Missouri in 2016 due in large part to the Noranda's sales loses.","Moving to Page 12, here we begin to outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate case which Warner mentioned earlier. Earlier this week parties to this proceeding jointly proposed a schedule to the Missouri Public Service Commission and key dates of the proposed schedule are listed on this page. We expect the Public Service Commission to decide the case by late April of next year with new rates expected to be effective in late May.","Further on Page 13, you can see that three quarters of $206 million request is driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales largely driven by the idling of Noranda's smelter and recover increased MISO transmission charges. To address the regulatory leg associated with these increasing transmission expenses we've requested the implementation of a new MISO transmission tracker. In addition the rate filing includes $8 million for amortized recovery of an estimated $81 million of fixed cost not recovered as a result of lower sales to Noranda. I would also like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","Turning to Page 14, in April Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing with the ICC. Under formula rate making Ameren Illinois makes such filings to systematically adjust cash flows overtime for changes in cost of service and to true up any period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investments that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual costs by the end of this year.","Late last month Ameren Illinois and the ICC staff entered into a stipulation agreement that resolved all issues currently existing between them and supported an annual revenue requirement that is consistent with Ameren Illinois\u2019 filing. The positions for other interveners in the case are noted on this page. And an ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base. The formula determined allowed ROE which is the annual average of 30 year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing.","Turning to Page 15 here we outline the previously mentioned complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. In the first case last December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE and the FERC is expected to issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. In the second case in late June the FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 9.7% base allowed ROE with the final FERC decision expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these pending cases and consistent with the ALJ ruling in each case, we have accrued to reserve for potential refunds of $58 million as of June 30, 2016.","Finally turning to Page 16 I will summarize. Year-to-date in 2016 we continue to successfully execute our strategy and we have delivered solid second quarter and year-to-date results. Our solid year-to-date results allowed us to increase our full year earnings guidance range for 2016. Further, on our February call we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020 excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year.","We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period, based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend which provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.3% and which is above average compared to fully regulated utility peers, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please state your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just first detailed question and a bigger picture question, on energy efficiency, obviously you're talking about lower load growth here in general, but what is the annualized impact here in 2016 after incentives? It seems as if it's about $0.17. In tandem with, that what are the weather-normalized sales trends excluding Noranda? And then most importantly, what are your 2017 expectations as you think about that energy efficiency drag?","Marty Lyons","Yes sure Julien, this is Marty, and obviously a number of questions there. I think as that relates to energy efficiency you got to keep in mind that some of what we\u2019ve quantified is year-over-year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So when we think about that you got to remember that the construct of the energy efficiency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was different than the one we\u2019ve got now and last year we were being compensated for some of the efforts associated with energy efficiency and being compensated not only for the current year effects in 2015 but some of the carryover effects to 2016. And so that\u2019s creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve noted some of those effects this year.","In terms of the sales trends what we\u2019re seeing we mentioned this on the call year-to-date on a consolidated basis residential and commercial sales were roughly flat. Frankly they\u2019re up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. Then industrial sales overall were down about 4% with Missouri down about 0.5% and Illinois down more significantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy efficiency in Missouri we would actually see overall sales instead of being flat. Overall sales we see up about a 1.5%. On the residential we think they\u2019d be up about 1.3%, commercial maybe up 2% and industrial while they\u2019re down on a reported basis maybe up 0.5% excluding energy efficiency. So we do see those programs as having an effect both the programs we put in place last year are having a carryover effect to this year, but also the current year programs that we\u2019ve now put into place. So they are having an impact but overall sales are about where we thought. We said they -- we thought they\u2019d be about flattish because of the effects of energy efficiency and that\u2019s about where they are.","I think economically unemployment is running pretty good in Missouri frankly I think you probably saw nationally the unemployment was about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we\u2019re seeing in Missouri is it's actually running a little bit below that, closer to 4%. While unfortunately on the Illinois side, where we\u2019re seeing some of the industrial sales declines, seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there about 6% but overall I think the economies are remaining stable. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of growth I\u2019d say in Missouri especially when you strip out energy efficiency. And then in Illinois while the industrial sales are down we\u2019re still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just a follow-up here on the broader 5% to 8% CAGR, can you comment quickly what the impact is from the U.S. treasury being down within that range perhaps it's linear but I just want to reaffirm it? And then separately related what about the impact from the pension discount rates? Just want to make sure we under it's probably fairly modest given Illinois and then also Missouri. But just want to make sure we have that right?","Marty Lyons","Yes, sure I understand the question. I think that, as you would think about the 5% to 8% growth overtime as we\u2019ve said repeatedly that is really anchored by the 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. And so that really is the foundation and then when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly changes in treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth levels, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look it\u2019s a five year outlook going out to 2020, so a number of things can happen over that time and that's why we have sort of a $0.40 range when you look out to 2020.","As it relates to the current impact of 30 year treasuries as we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower treasury yield than we expected at the beginning of the year. The beginning of the year we had expected treasury yields to be around 3.2, what we've booked to as of the end of June is an average rate for the year of about 2.65 and of course the current 30 year treasuries are sitting at 2.25. So, that has caused us to change our outlook for this year. We've baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that 50 basis points move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois delivery business about $0.025. That gives you a sensitivity but we've baked that into our current year guidance, we feel very good about the guidance, we were able to raise it $0.05 as you know this year which is a position, it's net of the impacts of those changes in 30 year treasuries.","And as it relates to our long-term guidance we obviously update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage our business going forward on an annual basis but right now I feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we've projected.","Warner Baxter","[Multiple Speakers] and then one other issue on pensions and OPEBs.","Marty Lyons","Yes thanks Warner. On the pension and OPEB which was a good question Julien, I know that's impacting some folks with the lower discount rates that are expected but we have trackers in Missouri for both pension and OPEB and then in Illinois for our energy deliver business as well as in our FERC transmission business, you have formulaic rates, so we're largely protected from those declines that are happening in terms of the discount rate. In the Illinois gas business obviously we have forecasted test years and depending on the timing of those filings there can be some impact there, but largely insulated from the impacts of the changes in discount rates and any kind of asset performance changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Russo with the Ladenburg Thalmann. Please state your question.","Brian Russo","The $0.05 increase in the guidance, is there any way to breakdown some of the more noticeable positives and negatives? It looks like interest rates would be maybe a $0.025 negative versus previous guidance and I'm not sure, I think weather is a $0.01 positive, just maybe if you can elaborate on that, what's operational and what's kind of weather related?","Warner Baxter","And I think if you look back at our beginning of the year guidance and then walk through our first quarter and now second quarter disclosures you can piece some of these things together and you've got some of those. I think as it relates to starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and thinking about how it moved. W had an $0.08 or so pickup from the adoption of the new accounting standard in the first quarter which was a positive. At that same time we also had a couple of additional cents of decline due to this Noranda outage we started the year thinking it was going to be a $0.13 impact and we're at about $0.15 impact. We also had as you mentioned we have now had a little bit of lowered expectation in terms of the treasury rates and again that like you said that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well, so those are some of the impacts of it that we had.","Now in the first quarter we also had negative weather it was it about $0.05 negative in the first quarter as mentioned on the call we had positive weather here in the second quarter which more than offset and we're about a penny positive now for weather year-to-date. So when you look at that, you look at that where we are at the end of six months you have got that tax gain that we experienced in the first quarter, you get about a penny of positive weather. And we've had some offsets due to the decline in the treasuries and then this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So those are some of the things that were pluses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with the backdrop of solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05.","Brian Russo","Okay, great. It's my understanding that you're using the ATXI and FERC transmission is being financed at the parent. Just want to be -- just like you to clarify the financing strategy with ATXI and when might we see it break out into a separate sub and that parent leverage be a little bit more transparent? ","Warner Baxter","Yes, that\u2019s a, you correctly described it, I mean what we're doing today think of it as the most, has been the most efficient way to do it as we've been financing the transmission growth at our ATXI business through financing at the parent which we've got both some short-term and long-term financing in place there at the parent that supports the investments we've been making at ATXI. Obviously as that short-term debt grows the parent will consider when it might be appropriate to term some of that out. I don't expect that to be this year, but in perspective periods we very well might consider that and to the extent that we believe it\u2019s more efficient at that point to do it, at an entity other Ameren Corp., at either ATXI or a holding company level, we'll evaluate that going forward. But as we approach that decision, whether that would be next year or in some period beyond we'll certainly be happy to discuss our thinking at that time about why we're proceeding.","Brian Russo","And then the Missouri electric case filing, did you file a utility cap structure or the parent cap structure?","Warner Baxter","Yes in the Missouri filing that we filed as we mentioned on the call, you have a equity content in the cap structure of 51.8% and that is the cap structure of the utility subsidiary Ameren Missouri.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Michael Lapides","Can you talk about in your multi-year forecast what your planning is for leverage at the holding company level? Meaning, do you plan on de-levering the holding company? Do you plan on issuing debt solely to fund ATXI or using debt at the holding company level and sending it down to the utilities to help fund utility growth?","Marty Lyons","Michael this is Marty and as you've seen in our slides we have about an $11 billion expenditure plan over the next five years. It's something that we believe given the strength of our balance sheet today. We can finance solely with debt and maintain a very strong balance sheet and maintain very strong credit metrics relative to the ratings that we have today. And then as we think about the expenditures, obviously we\u2019ve got those in each of the subsidiaries. We do financing independently at each one of the subsidiaries. So we have obviously we issued long-term debt at Ameren Illinois and Missouri and then as we just spoke about on our prior Q&A as it relates to the ATXI transmission business then we are using parent company leverage to be able to adapt, to be able to fund those investments at ATXI. And at some point may very well be able to do financing either at ATXI or some sort of intermediate holding company. But that\u2019s overall our plan and our goal is with each one of our utility subsidiaries to maintain very strong overall balance sheets there as well. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re balancing things out and again we do believe we\u2019ll be able to finance this capital expenditure plan with that over the coming five year period.","Michael Lapides","So no real plans for equity or significant debt at the holding company to infuse those equity into the operating companies?","Warner Baxter","That is correct that\u2019s absolutely correct. And I think one thing too to keep in mind longer term overtime we\u2019ll be able to monetize some of the tax assets that we have up at the parent. We\u2019ve got quite a bit of tax assets built up overall, about 760 million but about 460 million or so of that is really at the parent company and something that overtime we\u2019ll be able to monetize as well.","Michael Lapides","One last one and this is really I don\u2019t know if this is Warner or for Michael, but when you\u2019re thinking about the proceeding in Missouri to help improve rate making processes. I know some of the testimony filing dates have already passed and honestly it didn\u2019t look like there were a lots of suggestions of very specific things that other interveners besides you guys really were recommending more -- and that testimony seem like it was more please don\u2019t this or don\u2019t do that but not as much please do this or do that. How do you think the commission kind of takes it from there, like if you think about it as this is a giant kind a caldron a boiling pot or lots of things can come out this. How do you think about what the options that the commission actually looks at are based on what\u2019s been filed in the public estimates?","Warner Baxter","Hello Michael this is Warner. I\u2019ll take a shot at it and then I\u2019ll let Michael add some more of the details on that. Number one I think I would start with this. This is a positive development that we\u2019re talking about the need to address Missouri\u2019s agent infrastructure and seeking solutions, especially outside of the legislative session. So I see that these proceedings that are being conducted both by the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Senate Interim Committee an opportunity for stakeholders really to come together to not only share ideas, to share differences and to try and find a constructive path forward.","And so while maybe some of the filings included things that the interveners or others did not want to see that\u2019s informative. But secondly I know that Ameren Missouri and then certainly the utility group they filed specific suggestions and there was a host of suggestions to try and address this issue. So I fully expected the commission to carefully look at these things to engage with stakeholders as well as the Senate Interim Committee to try and advance Missouri forward, because as we\u2019ve been consistent, we strongly believe that this is not only an opportunity but one of these things that is really imperative to Missouri to move forward with that constructive policies. And so we're encouraged by these developments, we look forward to engage with the key stakeholders. Michael you've been working with some of the more specific key stakeholders, anything you'd like to add in terms of the overall process and where things go from here?","Michael Moehn","I think that I mean where we are today is a positive as Warner said, I mean there's a great deal of dialogue that's occurring and I think that given where the various stakeholders are it's not terribly surprising I think that the commission has been very constructive in this process, we'll have a couple of more rounds of testimony as we move through it. As Warner said the Interim Senate Committee is going to hold some hearings in the very near future. They're really looking to get some outside perspectives. And I think to me the one thing that's really positive in all of this is there's a recognition of the issue. Now, there's not tremendous consensus on what the solution is yet but there's a recognition of the issue and that's where this whole thing starts. Once we have the problem identified we can figure out how to go about it and come through debate and dialogue, come up with the right solutions. So, I think it's a positive first step, it is hard to predict where it's going to go, but both I think the commission ordered process as well as the Interim Senate Committee are driving towards an early December date with ample time to work something through the legislative process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please state your question.","Paul Patterson","Just a few quick follow-ups, most of my questions have been answered but, the tax asset monetization that you were referring to is that just over the course of business or is there any potential transaction that might be contemplated as such I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little further on that?","Warner Baxter","Yes, really expect it to be monetized just over the course of business. As we go through time, what'll happen is that as we have taxable earnings and we have taxes due, what'll happen overtime is that the utilities will burn off their tax assets the utilities will then pay taxes up to the parent. The parent will be able to monetize the sort of kind of this tax shield of the 460 million that I spoke about. And then ultimately once that's burned through Ameren Corp. becomes a tax payor which is out in the 20-21 timeframe is when we project today.","Paul Patterson","And then on Illinois, there's a lot of legislative discussion there regarding the nuke stuff that EXELON is asking for but also others are asking for sort of renewable stuff etcetera and there's been some discussion of an ominous bill. There's discussion of singlized those kind of things, and I was just wondering is there any opportunity there for you guys giving your formula rate plan and everything else for additional investments or additional opportunity or any thoughts of risks or any thoughts that you guys have that in terms of seeing what's going on in the Illinois?","Warner Baxter","Hello Paul this is Warner again. The simple answer is yes, we're at the table with key stakeholders and as EXELON and others have promoted plans or potential pieces of legislation. We've provided input and we provided input that we believe that will encourage some additional investments that we believe will benefit customers, but also to make sure that is balanced for certainly the Southern part of Illinois as well as the Northern part of Illinois. It's all part of the framework and so we think there are opportunities, whether that will be a legislative effort that will be the priority for this legislature here in the short-term remains to be seen. They obviously are very focused on addressing some budget issues and so once those matters are addressed perhaps an energy legislation will come to the forefront. But the bottom-line is we're engaged, we're simply engaged with them and Richard Mark oversees our operations there. Richard would you have anything else to add there?","Richard Mark","No, I think you put it well Warner. I think we're at the table with stakeholders who are watching the legislation very closely, but in Illinois right now I think the primary focus of the legislature is trying to get some of the state budget issues resolved.","Warner Baxter","Sure.","Paul Patterson","Right, sure. And then just finally, on the Mark Twain, you guys mentioned the assent process of the counties. Is that going well? Is that working out, as just as a sort of a follow-up from -- was just wondering what, if there was anything, going on there?","Warner Baxter","We'll have Maureen Borkowski who oversees our transmission operations she will be able to give you some input on that.","Maureen Borkowski","Hi, this is Maureen, yes we think that Mark Twain is going as per schedule, we're basically preparing packets of information to demonstrate to each county that we need the statutory requirement of safely crossing public roadways and we continue to have dialogue with each of the commissioners in each of the five counties to move that forward. So everything's on schedule at this point.","Operator","Our last question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.","Steve Fleishman","I wanted to give you a rare compliment for basically staying disciplined in this Westar M&A process. Usually people congratulate on doing deals but sometimes best not to. Just on that front, though, could you maybe just give a sense of how important M&A is to the plan, or is it pretty much focus on the core rate-based growth and is kind of more opportunistic? ","Warner Baxter","Steve, this is Warner, so let me comment squarely on this. Our focus is on the strategic plan we laid out right at the outset. And that focus as you can see is on the organic growth in our business which is driven by robust rate base growth which we believe is going to deliver solid earnings per share growth. And we have obviously talked about the dividend that goes along with it, it is going to deliver what we think is superior total shareholder return. As you said we do believe the industry will continue to consolidate and certainly in the past we have obviously participated in some level of consolidation and so the bottom-line is we're focused on our organic growth plan, we're attentive to what\u2019s going on in the industry and we'll simply just continue to execute, execute, execute, period.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time, so I will turn it back to Mr. Fischer for closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating in this call. Let me remind you again that a replay of the call will be available for one year on our Web site, if you have question you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release, financial analyst inquiry should be directed to me Doug Fischer or my associate Andrew Kirk.

Thank you, Mr. Fischer. You may now begin.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. I'm Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details.

He will then provide a business update. Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and provide updates on financial and regulatory matters. We will then open the call for questions.","Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted and continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner L. Baxter","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced third quarter 2014 earnings of $1.20 per share compared to the year-ago quarter's earnings of $1.25 per share. This earnings decrease primarily reflected milder summer temperatures in this year's quarter, which reduced native load electric sales volume. This lowered earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to the year-ago quarter and by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to normal. Marty will discuss other key drivers of third quarter earnings in a few minutes. While the milder-than-normal third quarter temperatures erased most of the weather-related earnings benefits realized earlier in the year, we remain on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2014.","In fact, earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year were $2.21 per share, an increase of $0.30 per share compared to the year-ago 9-month period. As a result, today, we narrowed our earnings guidance range for this year to $2.30 to $2.45 per share from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share.","Turning to page 5. We have also reaffirmed our longer-term earnings per share growth outlook of 7% to 10%, compounded annually from 2013 to 2018.","In addition, I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share, resulting in a new indicated annual rate of $1.64 per share. This is a 2.5% increase from the prior rate of $1.60 per share and reflects the increased financial stability that resulted from the disposition of the merchant power business and our confidence in the outlook for our regulated utility businesses.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows, economic and other business conditions. And, as I stated a moment ago, we are focused on delivering strong earnings growth in the future as we execute our well-defined strategic plan.","Which takes me to Page 6 of the presentation. Our strategic plan calls for investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. In addition, we are working to enhance those frameworks as well as advocating for responsible energy policies at both the federal and state levels.","Finally, we are focused on delivering superior, sustainable long-term earnings growth by creating and capitalizing on opportunities to invest in our rate-regulated businesses for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.","Turning now to Page 7. In line with our strategy, we are allocating capital consistent with the various regulatory frameworks under which our utilities operate, and our plan for doing so over the 5 years ending in 2018 is outlined on this page.","We are investing significant and growing amounts of discretionary capital in our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities at Ameren Illinois and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois and in Ameren Illinois' electric and natural gas delivery businesses. We are doing so because these investments can improve the reliability, safety and sustainability of the service we provide to our customers and because these businesses operate under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. Further, these investments benefit our regional economy by creating jobs. Overall, we have developed a solid list of projects at each of our subsidiaries and expect combined rate base to grow at a rate of approximately 6% compounded annually over the noted 5-year period.","We project that this rate base growth and capital allocation, particularly to FERC-regulated transmission, will lead to the strong earnings growth that I previously mentioned.","Moving now to Page 8. I am very pleased to say that we are successfully implementing this 5-year investment plan. In Missouri, we are currently focused on completing several key projects. We are replacing the reactor vessel head at our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center during its current refueling and maintenance outage, which I'm happy to report is proceeding according to plan. We're also installing additional environmental controls at our Labadie Energy Center and placing into service the largest investor-owned solar facility in the state. These projects are expected to be in service by year end so that they, along with recently completed substations like the one shown on the cover of this presentation, can meet our customers' energy needs and expectations as well as be included in the rate base used to compute the revenue requirement in our pending electric rate case. Reflecting these and other projects, our rate case filing includes rate base additions of approximately $500 million compared to those included in our prior rate order in late 2012.","In Illinois, we continue to implement our electric and natural gas distribution system modernization action plan. Our customers have already experienced improvements in service quality, including reliability, as a result of the investments we are making. This modernization plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and approximately 470,000 advanced natural gas meter modules. Since we began the effort this summer, we have installed approximately 17,000 new electric and 5,000 new gas meter modules as part of the initial stage of this multiyear effort. And we expect these installations to reach at least 40,000 and 25,000, respectively, by year end.","In addition, our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities continue to grow with projects at both Ameren Illinois and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois proceeding on schedule. In fact, we have invested approximately $375 million in such transmission projects over the first 9 months of this year, on our way to a planned investment of more than $525 million for the full year. This includes Illinois Rivers, the largest of our transmission projects, where construction has started on 7 of 10 substations and real estate easements have been obtained on 40% of the properties along the route.","In addition, foundation construction on one line segment has begun, and clearing on another line segment is well underway. Of course, execution of our strategic plan requires successfully managing rate cases to recover and earn fair returns in the investments we're making to benefit customers as well as addressing other regulatory matters.","In Missouri, we are squarely focused on achieving a constructive conclusion to the $264 million electric rate case we filed in July. The key driver of this rate request is capital projects, including those I mentioned earlier. In Illinois, our annual proceeding for updating electric delivery formula rates is nearing conclusion. Based on the recent administrative law judges' recommendation in this case, I expect that we will achieve a constructive outcome. Marty will provide more details on these regulatory matters a bit later.","Finally, to mitigate rate increases for our customers and to maximize value for our shareholders, we remain relentlessly focused on operational improvement and disciplined management of our costs. A good example of our progress in this area is the award won by Ameren Missouri's largest coal-fired energy center, Labadie.","In August of this year, Navigant recognized Labadie as the top-performing large-unit, coal-fired energy center in the United States based on detailed analysis of cost, performance and safety data. Another example of our focus on cost management is the $0.07 per share reduction in parent and other operating costs we achieved for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year compared to the year-ago period.","Turning now to Page 9. In addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2018.","Our Illinois Modernization Action Plan is a 10-year plan designed to extend through 2021. With the support of continued constructive ratemaking, we expect to continue to make significant investments under this plan to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas delivery systems in Illinois.","Further, we are pursuing additional FERC-regulated electric transmission projects in the Midwest region beyond those included in our current 2014 through 2018 investment plan. We have the exclusive right to build the projects already included in our current 5-year plan. Future projects may include those we have the exclusive right to build, as well as regional and interregional projects that would be subject to competition under FERC Order 1000. We are particularly focused on Order 1000 projects that would resolve transmission system issues in and around Ameren's traditional service territory, including projects in and between MISO Central, MISO South, PJM and SPP. Our transmission development team continues to actively respond to competitive solicitations at the regional and interregional levels that are conducted by MISO, PJM and SPP and have submitted many project solutions. These regional transmission organizations are expected to make awards in these solicitations as soon as the end of next year.","Finally, in Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investment. These include the installation of new advanced meters and replacement of aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also have the opportunity to make investments to transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion, including further environmental controls on our existing coal-fired energy centers and the addition of renewable and gas-fired combined cycle generation capacity. We believe these longer-term opportunities for investment will benefit customers by improving reliability, safety, market efficiency and the environment.","Turning to Page 10. Speaking of electric generation and the environment, Ameren Missouri filed its integrated resource plan or IRP with the Missouri Public Service Commission last month, which it does every 3 years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs of our customers for the coming 20 years and puts forward our preferred plan for meeting those needs.","The 2014 IRP outlines our plan to deliver safe, reliable and reasonably priced electricity to our customers, while transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation fleet to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. It includes expanding renewable generation, retiring coal-fired generation capacity as this capacity reaches the end of its useful life and adding cleaner-burning natural gas-fired combined cycle generation.","Further, we expect to continue to offer significant levels of energy efficiency programs under the constructive regulatory framework in Missouri for these investments and to begin to offer demand response programs.","As noted on Page 10, we project that our preferred plan will acquire an investment of approximately $4.5 billion over the 20-year period for new generation and environmental controls. This amount is in addition to investments Ameren Missouri anticipates making to maintain and improve its existing energy centers and its transmission and distribution systems. As we have stated in the past, the level and timing of these investments will be influenced by the regulatory framework in place to support investment in energy infrastructure. Our preferred plan is projected to achieve the ultimate carbon emissions reductions proposed by the U.S. EPA this past summer in its Clean Power Plan by 2035 rather than the EPA's final target date of 2030 or its aggressive interim target dates beginning in 2020.","Our plan will achieve these significant carbon emission reductions at a cost to customers that is estimated to be $4 billion less than what would be incurred to meet the EPA's proposal. In addition, our plan would provide us with important operational flexibility to address changes in customer energy demand, changes in technology and new regulations, among other things.","Finally, our approach would significantly mitigate potential regional reliability risks that have been raised by many in our industry. That is why we are aggressively advocating for energy policies at both the federal and state levels which support the implementation of our preferred plan.","We do so because we simply believe it is the right things to do for our customers, the environment and our shareholders. By December 1, we will file comments with the EPA on their proposed rule. Our comments will focus on several key issues, including the aggressive interim target dates and their impact on customer costs and system reliability, as well as the challenges associated with the EPA's 4 building blocks, among other things. We look forward to working in a constructive fashion with key stakeholders, including the EPA, on this important energy policy matter.","And to be clear, should the EPA's proposed regulation withstand the legal challenges it will certainly face and ultimately require us to reduce our carbon emissions in a manner different than our preferred plan, we expect that our prudent investments to comply with these regulations will be fairly treated by our regulators, as they have been in the past.","In closing, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board. And I'm firmly convinced that this will enable us to deliver superior long-term value to our customers and our shareholders.","Again, thank you, all, for joining us. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?","Martin J. Lyons","Thank you, Warner. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. As Warner noted today, we reported earnings of $1.20 per share for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $1.25 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Key drivers of this earnings decline are listed on this page. We experienced much milder-than-normal temperatures in the third quarter of this year with cooling degree days falling 10 percent below those of the year-ago quarter and 14% below normal in our service territories. As a result, native load electric sales volumes declined, reducing earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to the third quarter of last year and by an estimated $0.09 per share compared to normal.","Other factors contributing to the decrease of the third quarter 2014 earning from the year-ago quarter included a higher effective tax rate and increased depreciation and amortization expenses. The earnings comparison was positively affected by increased rates for FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois natural gas delivery services, both effective at the beginning of this year, as well as decreased interest charges.","Moving then to Page 13. As Warner also mentioned, our full year 2014 earnings guidance range is now $2.30 to $2.45 per share. On this page, we highlight select fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share considerations incorporated into this guidance. First, we expect fourth quarter 2014 results to benefit from the previously discussed 2014 increases in rates for FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois natural gas delivery services.","Second, Illinois electric delivery earnings under formula ratemaking are expected to increase compared to the year-ago fourth quarter. This reflects expected higher revenues recognized under formula ratemaking as a result of higher rate base, among other things. The allowed ROE for our Illinois electric delivery service is established by adding 580 basis points to the year's average 30-year treasury bond yield. Given the level of 30-year treasury bond yields for the year-to-date and the consensus estimate for the balance of the year, our 2014 guidance now incorporates a formula midpoint allowed ROE of 9.2%, which is comparable to last year's allowed ROE. Other factors expected to benefit the fourth quarter earnings comparison include lower interest expense, reflecting the maturity this past May of high-coupon parent company senior notes, which was funded with low-cost, short-term debt.","The final positive I would like to note is the absence this year of a fourth quarter 2013 ICC debt redemption cost disallowance of $0.04 per share. Factors that are expected to negatively affect the fourth quarter earnings comparison include expenses associated with the ongoing Callaway Nuclear Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage. This is expected to reduce fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.09 per share. Further, our earnings guidance assumes normal temperatures for the fourth quarter, which would reduce earnings by an estimated $0.04 per share compared to the year-ago quarter. In addition, other operations and maintenance, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses, are expected to increase compared to the year-ago quarter. Finally, we continue to expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 39.5%.","Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on the fourth quarter earnings comparison. Before moving to the next page, I do want to note that free cash flow after dividends as defined on Page 19 of the appendix is now anticipated to be negative by approximately $820 million for 2014.","Turning then to Page 14. I'll provide a brief update on certain recent and pending regulatory matters. I'm pleased to note that the Missouri Public Service Commission has denied the electric rate shift and earnings complaint cases filed earlier this year, each by unanimous votes of 5 to 0, in orders issued in August and October. The regulatory focus regarding Ameren Missouri is now clearly on the pending request for a $264 million increase in annual electric service rates. This request is driven by increased net energy cost, electric infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, recovery in rebates paid for customer-installed solar generation and is net of significant reductions in operating cost.","The next key milestone in the filing of direct -- is the filing of direct testimony by the Missouri PSC staff and intervenors, which is due by December 5. The PSC's hearings in this case are scheduled to begin in late February of next year, with a commission decision anticipated by May, and new rates are expected to be effective by June.","Moving to Illinois regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, our annual electric delivery formula rate update filing is pending at the ICC. While this filing would increase 2015 electric delivery service rates by $205 million, total electric bills in 2015 are still expected to remain below 2011 levels for most customers. I'm pleased to report that last Friday, the ICC administrative law judges issued a constructive recommendation in this case. They supported a rate increase of $204.5 million, an amount nearly equal to our request. An ICC decision in this case is expected by December of this year with new rates to be effective in January of next year.","Finally, at the FERC, a customer group filed a complaint case in November of last year seeking a reduction in the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%, which is the current allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois transmission service. This case could result in a reduction to this rate retroactive to the complaint filing date.","Last month, the FERC issued an order setting the base ROE issue in this case for settlement discussions and, if necessary, hearing. However, it denied all other aspects of the complaint. We do not expect this case to be decided until at least sometime in 2015. Further, we believe Ameren Illinois and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois are eligible for an adder of up to 50 basis points to their allowed base ROEs to reflect their voluntary membership in a regional transmission organization and plan to request such an adder from FERC shortly.","Moving to Page 15 of our presentation. As next year approaches, we want to let you know that we plan to provide 2015 earnings guidance and update our longer-term earnings outlook when we release fourth quarter 2014 earnings in February of next year. However, today, we are providing a list of select items to consider as you think about our earnings for next year.","Increased Missouri electric service rates are expected to be implemented by June 2015 as a result of our pending rate case. Our rate increase request is driven, in part, by our need to recover and earn a return on new infrastructure investments, including the key projects Warner discussed earlier, which are expected to be placed in service by the end of this year. Since new rates are not expected to be effective until June of next year, regulatory lag resulting primarily from these investments will be experienced during the first half of 2015. Further, no Callaway Nuclear refueling outage is scheduled in 2015, as these outages are on an 18-month cycle, with the next one scheduled for the spring of 2016. For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2015 compared to 2014 under formula ratemaking due to higher rate base, reflecting infrastructure investments. We also expect to begin using the Illinois natural gas delivery infrastructure rider in 2015, which is anticipated to have a positive impact on earnings. Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit under forward-looking formula ratemaking from higher rate base from investments in reliability projects at Ameren Illinois and multi-value regional projects at Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois. Another factor that could affect the level of 2015 transmission earnings is the possibility of a change in the allowed ROE, as I previously discussed.","Regarding parent and other cost, we expect a full year of interest cost savings related to the May 2014 maturity of parent company notes. And finally, as we mentioned on our August earnings call, we forecast our 2015 effective income tax rate will be about 1 percentage point lower than the expected 2014 level.","Turning finally to Page 16, I will summarize. As Warner discussed, we remain on track to deliver strong 2014 earnings growth and are successfully executing our strategy. Further, we believe Ameren shares offer investors an earning growth outlook and dividend yield, which are both above peer group averages. Earnings per share expected to grow a strong 7% to 10% compounded annual growth rate from 2013 through 2018. Further, Ameren's recently increased annualized dividend rate of $1.64 per share provides investors with a high current yield of approximately 3.8%. In our view, this earnings growth, coupled with our dividend yield, add up to a very attractive total return potential for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the -- I just want to settle -- I want to check out the FERC stuff a little bit here. The -- one of the things that came out of the order seemed to be sort of they dismissed the complaint -- one of the complainants' issues regarding the equity level. And I was wondering if you could remind us what the equity level is currently at the transmission business and whether that could be changed as a result of this.","Martin J. Lyons","Well, the -- Paul, this is Marty. In terms of the equity level, during construction, we do have the ability to use hypothetical cap structure with equity of 56% in that cap structure, and so that is what is being used. And then, as projects actually go into service, then they have the cap structure that is in whatever legal entity that they sit within. And so for example, within AIC right now, the equity structure is a little north of 50% in terms of where the equity sits in that cap structure.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So there probably wouldn't be much of a change, do you think? Or could there be, as a result of the FERC ruling that sits [indiscernible]?","Martin J. Lyons","I don't anticipate a significant change in the way we capitalize the business in light of the FERC's ruling.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the ROE, the 50 basis points, when do you see that? I know you guys are going to file for it shortly. When do you see that coming into effect? Would that be when the ROE situation is finally settled?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, I think we'll wait and let the filing speak for itself. It is a filing, not only our own filing, but with other transmission owners. And we don't want to get ahead of that filing and what we're asking for there. We do think that this language that was in the recent FERC order reaffirmed that, that adder is appropriate and needed. There's language in there that basically said the adder's intended to incent continued participation in the RTOs. And we think that was favorable language supportive of our view that, indeed, we're eligible for that 50 basis point adder. So that filing was made shortly. And then the FERC, based on history, had taken up consideration of that generally within a 60-day period. So, again, we'll let the filing speak for itself and can certainly answer questions once it's been filed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then finally, on the MISO-PJM or the -- there were several opportunities you guys saw in terms of FERC Order 1000. And one of them was transmission between MISO and PJM, I believe. And I was just wondering if you -- if there were any specific projects that had sort of been identified and sort of the timing that you guys think you might participate in terms of such a project and just any details you have on that or any -- could you just elaborate on that a little bit?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Paul. And I think, for that question, we'll let Maureen Borkowski, who's the CEO of that business, speak to that question.","Maureen A. Borkowski","Paul, this is Maureen. We've been participating actively and proposing project solutions in PJM and in the cross-border MISO PJM solicitations. There's actually a window that's just opened that we'll be continuing to participate in. We've proposed dozens of different solutions to date. There are still, I think, 1 or 2 that are still pending for further consideration. But we're continuing to populate that -- those project proposals as PJM opens study windows. So I'd say just to stay tuned. We certainly continue to participate. And as they go through their refinement process of selecting which products move forward, we expect to have some.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","What's the next key data point we should think about, Maureen? In terms -- What do you think would be the next, in terms of timing, we might see more clarity as to what might actually be selected?","Maureen A. Borkowski","Well, you'll certainly see the volume of proposals should be public -- the window is open now, so over the next several weeks, more projects will be coming in. After the first of the year, PJM will be doing more refinement in their planning processes, looking at which ones meet their criteria to move forward. So I would say, first quarter of next year, there might be some indication of which projects are moving.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on some of Paul's questions. Do you guys have any kind of indication or any kind of inclination as to how many -- how much money some of these PJM, MISO and SPP seams issues might cost? What's the size of the opportunity we're looking at here?","Martin J. Lyons","Michael, this is Marty. We haven't really spoken to, I'd say, the size of the opportunity broadly. We have said that we've proposed tens of projects in various regions around our service territory, and whether that be with PJM, MISO, SPP, projects ranging anywhere individually from $50 million to $500 million. So we have said that but not really spoken to, I'd say, universally what the breadth of the opportunity is.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you guys think a settlement in the ROE complaint is a possibility?","Martin J. Lyons","The settlement in the ROE, certainly, it's a possibility. We and, I would imagine, other transmission owners certainly plan to take those settlement discussions seriously, and we'll see where they take us. Ultimately, if that process does fail to produce an outcome that is appropriate or, I guess, is reasonable to all parties then, obviously, we'll go to hearing, which would likely take a while. And again, either way, we think, as we said on our prepared remarks, would extend into 2015 and I would say quite possibly beyond, although I think definitely into 2015.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And one final question. On the IRP. Can you discuss a little bit about some of the factors that are going into your decision-making on plant retirements? And also, how much of the spending in the IRP that's beyond 2020, how much of that could theoretically and possibly be accelerated into the 2015 to 2020 range?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. This is Marty. I'll take that one again. So on the slide that we provided, on Slide 10, we laid out some of the investments that may be required as we implement our preferred plan that's laid out in the IRP. I would say, generally, with respect to our coal-fired power plants, the goal of the IRP and something we think's appropriate is to be able to run those plants and benefit from that capacity through the end of their useful lives. So that's one of the things that's sort of a foundation of our preferred plan. But along the way, as you see, investing in wind, solar, landfill gas and some hydro projects, as laid out on Slide 10 of our materials, we did break some of the potential capital expenditures down into 2 buckets, one bucket for the next 10 years and then the 10 years beyond that, mainly because the IRP filing is a 20-year look, a 20-year plan. I would say some of the investments that are in that first 10 years are embedded in our current capital expenditure and rate base growth guidance that we've provided. There's some that would be incremental to that. Much of that investment in that 10-year period would fall into the 5-year period beyond the current 5-year period we're in, so basically, rate base growth beyond the current 5-year period. As Warner discussed on the call, to the extent that the EPA's Clean Power Plan was ultimately put into effect in its current form, and of course, Warner spoke to the various legal and practical concerns with that plan, but as we mentioned, if it was put into place, the interim targets by 2020 with ultimate carbon reductions by 2030, we've said that would have potential impact on our customers of $4 billion. It would also require us to invest by 2020 an incremental $2 billion in additional infrastructure and rate base. So, again, we filed our IRP, we're advocating for our preferred plan, but ultimately, we're going to stay flexible and certainly continue to engage in discussions with EPA and other stakeholders around the Clean Power Plan.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is there any -- what's the status of discussions in Missouri about a legislative fix to lag? Is that just kind of dormant right now?","Martin J. Lyons","We'll let -- we have with us this morning, Michael Moehn, who's the CEO of the Ameren Missouri business, and we'll let him provide some comments on that.","Michael L. Moehn","Yes, it's certainly not dormant. I mean, we continue to talk to key legislators and key stakeholders about the aging infrastructure issue we have Missouri. As I sit here today, I don't have necessarily a decision on what we're going to do going into this legislative session. But we remain committed to trying to find ways to address that lag, either through the legislative arena or through the regulatory arena. But we definitely are spending a lot of time educating folks about that issue.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when does the session start up again?","Michael L. Moehn","January 2015.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","January. Okay. And then just your 7% to 10% CAGR, how lumpy is that? And is the biggest source of lumpiness kind of Callaway outages?","Martin J. Lyons","No. The 7% to 10% -- this is Marty again. The 7% to 10% growth, obviously, is driven by -- primarily by rate base growth. As you've seen, our rate base growth charted about 6% rate base growth between 2013 and 2018. So I'd say there's a little bit of lumpiness along the way that has to do with the timing of the capital expenditures, there'll be a little bit of lumpiness due to the timing of rate cases, and there'll be a little bit of lumpiness, as you say, along the way in earnings due to the Callaway refueling outage schedules. So we've got one ongoing right now, as we mentioned on the call, we don't have one next year, and then again, in 2018, we would not have one in 2018. So, as you're well aware, on an 18-month cycle for those refueling outages, but certainly there will be a little bit of lumpiness in earnings from year to year for the reasons I described.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And so next year, we should have a $0.09 pickup on Callaway?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, that would be right. So we have a $0.09 negative impact here in the fourth quarter from that refueling outage. There won't be one next year, so we would expect to see a $0.09 pickup for Callaway. And then, as I described in the earnings drivers for next year, I referred you to that slide, there's a number of pluses and minuses for next year, but certainly, that's a plus.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just -- you said that next year's tax rate is expected to be 38.5%?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, that's a good point and, I think, an important one. We have an effective tax rate projected for this year of 39.5%. And that compares, last year, we actually, finished the year at about 37.5%. And so in our third quarter and you'll expect in the fourth quarter to have a little bit of a negative delta of this year versus last. But next year, we expect that to trend back to 38.5%, which is, frankly, where our longer-term expectations are. So I think that 38.5% is sort of a good thing to think about in terms of model.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of David Paz of Wolfe Research.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","I just wanted to check on the sales growth. What was the weather-adjusted sales growth by class in the third quarter? And just what you expect for the full year '14?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, David, that's a very good question. I appreciate you asking, and I'll give you -- it's a bit of a more long-winded answer than you might expect. But I think generally, some positive trends and some positive data that we do have to report. When you look at the sales data in the statistics page, you will see a decline. Of course, part of that is weather, as you point out. But part of it, I think, you've got to remember too, has to do with the energy efficiency programs we have in Missouri. And those energy efficiency programs, we do believe, are very fair, constructive programs where we are made whole for the impacts, the cost and the impacts of that energy efficiency and even, to some extent, are provided incentives. So getting to your question, though, looking at the third quarter data on a weather-normalized basis, the residential and commercial sales were down about 0.8% and the industrial was down about 0.9%, which, on the surface, is not appealing. But when you actually, again, peel that back and you look at, for example, in Missouri, the residential, weather-normalized sales are down 1.1%, but energy efficiency spending and investment is really causing most to that. Excluding the energy efficiency impact, residential sales are actually be up 1%. And again, we're being compensated for that energy efficiency impact. So again, normalized for weather and energy efficiency, up 1%. Commercial sales on a weather-normalized basis -- and these are year-to-date numbers, by the way, that residential number. Commercial sales, weather-normalized, is down about 0.6%. But again, if you exclude the impacts of energy efficiency, it was pretty flat. And then in terms of our industrial sales, you'll recall in Missouri, in the first 2 quarters, we had industrial sales increases in the third quarter. We did see a little bit of a decline, but that was solely related to a dip in usage at Noranda. On their earnings call a couple of days ago, indicated that they had some temporary production issues that I believe were probably causing that. Excluding that Noranda impact, on a year-to-date basis, our industrial sales are actually up 0.5% and, again, normalized for energy efficiency, are up 1.1%. So we're really seeing growth, again, in Missouri in all of those classes, residential, commercial and industrial, when normalizing for not only weather but for the energy efficiency. In Illinois, some positive trends there. Weather-normalized residential sales, up 1.5%. And they've been up across all 3 quarters. Commercial sales, up 0.7% year-to-date. And then, as we've reported previously, industrial sales have been off nearly 2%, and we've gone through some of the industrial categories that factor into that in prior calls. But overall, I'd say that trends are positive, and I'd say economically, we're seeing housing starts in our service territory have been on an upward trend, unemployment has been coming down near to the national averages around 6%, manufacturing jobs have been stable, services jobs have been growing, those were all positive, and our residential customer counts are up in both states and our commercial customer accounts are up in both states. So really some positive trends that we're seeing kind of across the board.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Great. Very helpful. Just a quick question on the weather impact versus normal year-to-date. Can you just remind me what that is?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. If you look at the Page 18 of our slide deck, year-to-date, the temperatures are having a negative -- excuse me, a positive 2% -- $0.02 versus normal. So year-to-date, again, temperatures, $0.02 positive versus normal.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","I see. Okay. Got it. And then just last one. Remind me, please, your 7% to 10% EPS CAGR is based off of what year and what number?","Martin J. Lyons","That was based on 2013, David. So that's 2013 through 2018 compound annual growth rate.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","So is that based just the reported 2013 or is it adjusted for any outages or weather impact?","Martin J. Lyons","No. It's continuing at reported continuing operations. So it is a GAAP number, and it's 2013 through 2018. And I'd say the only thing we've done there is, obviously, taken out discontinued operations.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Douglas Fischer","This is Doug Fischer.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. ","To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com website home page that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-Looking Statement section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC. ","Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.62 per share compared to $0.42 per share earned in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase of $0.20 per share was driven by higher Ameren Missouri electric service rates effective April 1, 2017, as well as higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales, primarily due to colder winter temperatures this year compared to the very mild temperatures experienced in the year-ago period. ","In addition, the comparison benefited from earnings on increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. Marty will discuss these and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. ","I am also pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver strong earnings results in 2018 in the range of $2.95 per share to $3.15 per share. We continue to focus on executing our strategic plan, which includes operating our businesses safely, while strategically allocating capital and exercising disciplined cost management. ","Moving to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. That plan is expected to continue to result in strong long-term earnings growth. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested over $325 million, or nearly 60% of total capital expenditures in our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. ","For Ameren Transmission, the Illinois rivers and Mark Twain projects remain on schedule for completion by the end of 2019, and we continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois local reliability projects. For Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution businesses, substantial grid modernization investments continue, including replacing aging infrastructure, supporting system capacity additions, making reliability improvements and deploying smart electric meters and gas meter modules. ","And finally, for Ameren Missouri, investments continue to be focused on providing a safe and adequate service across our entire system. ","Speaking of Ameren Missouri, we are working on 2 key strategic initiatives that support important incremental investments that will deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers and the State of Missouri. These initiatives are our efforts to enhance the Missouri electric regulatory framework, and our plan to add significant wind generation to Ameren Missouri's energy portfolio. ","Turning now to Page 6. I'll update you on the first of these strategic initiatives, our efforts to enhance the Missouri regulatory framework through legislation. As you know, over the last several years, Ameren Missouri has worked with other Missouri investor-owned electric utilities, state leaders and key stakeholders to modernize energy policies through legislation to support incremental investment in the state's energy grid. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments would lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid as well as provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage. In addition, modernized policies will position us to meet our customers' energy needs and rising expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. As most of you know, the Missouri Senate passed Senate Bill 564 earlier this year on a strong bipartisan vote. The bill is now ready to be taken up for consideration by the full Missouri House of Representatives. If the bill passes the House without amendments, it will be sent to the Governor. If enacted, Senate Bill 564 would significantly enhance Missouri's electric regulatory framework. In particular, it would support our ability to invest an incremental $1 billion in infrastructure for 2023 to deliver significant benefits to our customers and better position Missouri for the future. ","In addition, the Missouri PSC would be granted onetime authority to pass on the customers, in a very timely fashion, the savings stemming from the lower federal income tax rate retroactive to January 1, 2018. ","Further, customers would benefit from the rate certainty this legislation provides. Electric base rates will be frozen until April 1, 2020, and average overall rate increases would be capped at 2.85% compounded annually to 2023. ","The legislation will also provide economic development rates for certain incremental electric sales to larger customers, and it would maintain continued strong Missouri PSC oversight and consumer protections. The bottom line is that passage of this legislation would create a win-win for our customers, the State of Missouri and our shareholders. We will continue to work closely with key stakeholders through the end of the session on May 18 to get this important legislation passed. ","Moving on to Page 7 for an update on another key strategic initiative, our wind generation investment plans. We continue to make progress on Ameren Missouri's proposed investment in at least 700 megawatts for approximately $1 billion of wind generation to achieve compliance with Missouri's Renewable Energy Standard. In fact, we expect to file for certificates of convenience and necessity for ownership of at least 400 megawatts by June 30 with Missouri PSC. Decisions on these requests are expected within 6 to 10 months of filings. ","Further, we continue to hold discussions with other wind developers and expect to file for certificates of convenience and necessity for ownership of the balance of our wind generation needs this year. ","And finally, Regional Transmission Organization interconnection studies are already underway for sites under consideration. We look forward to executing this important component of our Integrated Resource Plan because we believe it would deliver clear benefits to our customers, the environment and the communities we serve. ","Turning now to Page 8. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year growth plan, which includes our expectation of 5% to 7% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2017 to 2022 period, choosing 2017 core earnings per share as a base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by expected 7% compound annual rate base growth over the same period. Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include $1 billion of potential incremental capital expenditures through 2023 associated with the Missouri Senate Bill 564 or the incremental investment opportunity of approximately $1 billion of wind generation by 2020. Further, we have a strong long-term infrastructure investment pipeline beyond 2022. ","In closing, we believe our strong earnings outlook, combined with our solid dividend, which currently provides a yield of approximately 3.2%, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. ","Now before I turn the call over to Marty, I would like to mention 2 recent and important enhancements to our disclosures about environmental, social and governance matters. First, in March, we issued our initial EEI ESG\/sustainability report, which will supplement Ameren's already substantial reporting on these issues. This report is part of a voluntary industry initiative, coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute, to provide electric industry investors with more uniform and consistent environmental, social, governance and sustainability related metrics. And finally, just last week, we issued our annual corporate social responsibility report. Both reports are available at amereninvestors.com. ","Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Lyons","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, today, we reported first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.62 per share compared to earnings of $0.42 per share for the year-ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.20 per share increase are highlighted by segment on this page. ","First, I would like to note that the lower 2018 federal corporate income tax expenses were almost entirely offset by a reduction in revenue, reflecting the expected passthrough of those savings to customers. ","For our transmission in Illinois electric and gas distribution segments, we have already received approvals from the FERC and ICC, respectively, to pass on approximately $115 million of 2018 federal tax savings to customers. And if Missouri Senate Bill 564 is enacted, that total would reach nearly $250 million. ","Now back to first quarter results. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, and also the largest driver of the year-over-year earnings improvement, reported an increase of $0.14 per share, up from $0.02 per share in 2017 to $0.16 per share in 2018. This improvement was driven by higher electric service rates effective April 1, 2017, as well as higher electric retail sales, primarily due to colder winter temperatures this year compared to the very mild temperatures experienced in the year-ago period. These 2 favorable factors were partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to higher-than-normal scheduled nonnuclear plant outages. ","Turning to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas results. Earnings for this segment grew $0.04 per share, reflecting increased infrastructure investments as well as benefits related to the lower 2018 federal income tax rate, though this tax benefit is expected to almost entirely reverse by year-end 2018. ","Finally, earnings for Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were each up slightly, reflecting increased infrastructure investments. In summary, we had a positive start to the year with increased earnings across all four operating segments. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first 3 months of this year compared to the first 3 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased about 0.5%, excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under MEEIA. We exclude MEEIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. ","Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased about 1%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cost, do not affect our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided for full revenue decoupling beginning in 2017. ","Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2018 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2018 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.15 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page. I will not comment specifically on these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and consistent with the 2018 earnings drivers and assumptions discussed on our February earnings call. ","Moving now to Page 12 for a discussion of select regulatory matters. For Ameren Transmission, there has been no change in the status of the second complaint case pending at the FERC that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners. We continue to expect that the FERC commissioners will consider the court ruling in the New England ROE case as well as the MISO transmission owners' motion to dismiss the second MISO ROE complaint case, as both may influence the future MISO allowed ROE. ","Moving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recovery of such cost. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead, with the decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. For perspective, if the requested rate update is approved by the ICC, all-in 2019 residential electric grades for customers taking delivery and energy service from Ameren Illinois will have decreased by an estimated 1% since electric formula ratemaking began in 2012, even after incorporating substantial infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers. ","Moving to Page 13. In Ameren's natural gas regulatory matters, earlier this year, we filed with the ICC for an annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2019 future test year. On this page, we have updated our request for stipulations and agreements with the ICC staff that incorporate a 9.87% allowed ROE and up to a 50% equity ratio. A decision is required by December of 2018, with new rates expected to be effective in January 2019. ","Turning now Missouri regulatory matters. In late February, the Missouri PSC staff issued its report recommending the commission open a proceeding for each utility and pursue rate reductions to pass savings from the lower federal income tax rate onto customers. Of course, if Senate Bill 564 is enacted, Ameren Missouri would pass savings from the lower federal rate onto electric customers in a timely fashion and retroactively apply to January 1, 2018, pursuant to the bill's provisions. ","Finally, turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2018, as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look over the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. In addition, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that, we believe, compares very favorably to our peers. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I wanted to follow up first on the wind investment side of the equation. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the 700 megawatts and the breakdown between the 400 and the balance, if you will. Can you talk a little about the sort of the time line here with respect to the incremental? You talked about the 400 being filed by June 30. What about the remainder here as far as the time when they see the CapEx dollars? And how should we be thinking about it if you ultimately are awarded this, the cadence of the CapEx, vis-\u00e0-vis the plan?","Warner Baxter","So Julien, this is Warner. I'll start with the overall timing and then I'll let Marty comment a little bit more on the CapEx piece. Now as we've said, we expect to file certificates of convenience for at least 400 megawatts by June 30. And then it is our expectation that we'll fill in the rest of our wind generation needs with agreements and filings with the Missouri Public Service Commission by the end of 2018. So Michael and his team in Ameren Missouri have been working hard with many of the developers, and they will continue to do so. So Marty, do you want to comment a little bit about the CapEx and the cadence associated with that?","Martin Lyons","Yes. Julien, taking your question in terms of the cadences, when would the CapEx occur relative to our plan. I think with regard to all of these projects, our objective is to get them in service by the end of 2020 in order to take advantage of the production tax credits depending upon how we finalize negotiations. For example, if they were ended up being build-transfer agreements, then, likely, the CapEx would really occur in that 2020 time frame. And again, the goal here is approximately 700 megawatts or at least 700 megawatts with approximately $1 billion of overall spending.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to clarify, why is it broken up between 400 and 300? Is it basically, if I were to read between the lines, the 400 you've sort of established and the 300 would be likely a build on transfer? Is that the right way to interpret this?","Warner Baxter","No, it's not, Julien. It's really just the status of our ongoing negotiations. So we have ongoing negotiations with multiple developers, and that's just how we see the time line unfolding this year in terms of completing negotiations and getting CCMs filed. It really does not have anything to do with the nature of the ultimate agreement, whether it be a build-transfer or otherwise. It's really just the situation where you're negotiating with multiple developers for multiple sites. Yes, but at the end of the day, the goal with respect to all 700 is to get that -- those megawatts into service, providing value to customers in the 2020 time frame.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then just as we come to the end of the legislative session here, sort of curious, what are options, if you will, be -- assuming there is an extension even beyond the end of the session here in the spring?","Warner Baxter","Julien, this is Warner. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you mean by options, but let me just tell you what we're focused on. We're focused on Senate Bill 564, which now has passed all the -- received approval by all the necessary legislative committees. It is now very well positioned for a final vote with the House -- in the House of Representatives. And so as you've been following this, I know you have, there's been a great deal of hard work, collaborative efforts and compromise to get this bill to where it's positioned now. And along the way, every time this bill has been reviewed by one of the committees, it has received strong bipartisan support. And so now, we have until May 18. And so Michael Moehn and his team are very focused on working with key stakeholders to make sure that bill gets adequate time in the floor and a vote in the House of Representatives.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. So it sounds like, for the time being, focused on the May 18 deadline and then we'll talk about anything after that in another point in time.","Warner Baxter","We are focused on May 18.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","We're focused on May 18, as well. But anyway, just on the impact of the wind on rates, could you remind me what you guys are thinking in terms of what you think the impact of the wind projects might be on rates? We've seen some utilities talk about actual rates going down. I'm just wondering what you guys are thinking.","Martin Lyons","Yes. Paul, this is Marty. We have not said specifically what we expect the impact to be. Over time, as we file the -- for the certificates of convenience and need and updates, the commission on our plans for compliance with the Renewable Energy Standard, we'll certainly provide that information to them. Overall, what we have said, which is consistent with the law, is that we do believe that we can ultimately own the 700 megawatts to comply with the Renewable Energy Standard, that the overall investment it'll make and the impact on customer rates would result in rates, on average, rising less than 1% on average over a 10-year period -- projected period, following the wind being put in place. And that's really a requirement of the Renewable Energy Standard. That's not to say, however, that we expect that rates would rise that much necessarily on average. As you note, there could certainly be expected benefits from the wind over time depending especially on what power prices are over time. So in any event, we haven't said specifically, but we will be providing those updates to the commissions through time. And we do expect that, like I said, we'll be able to deliver these projects and keep the impact on rates that -- under that 1% average.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. And then on the tax side, if the legislation were to happen, how would we think about this offset that you guys have, I guess, in booking in terms of the tax benefit, if you follow me? How would we think about that in -- how should we think about the tax benefit impacting your earnings if for the -- I know you guys don't expect this, but if the legislation were, for some reason, not to happen, how should we think about it?","Warner Baxter","Well, I think, if the legislation comes passed, number one, we would expect that the commission would have a proceeding then to figure out how much and over what period of time we would end up providing the benefits of the tax reform to customers. Again, as required by law, that proceeding could be initiated. Right now, as it relates to our financial results, just to be clear, our financial results for the first quarter don't assume that any benefit is retained by the shareholders and that we've established an accrual for the expectation of ultimately providing that benefit back to customers. Michael, do you have finer point?","Michael Moehn","I would just going to add, assuming the legislation is passed, just to be clear, within 90 days, we will be refunding that amount back to customers. And so that's spelled out in the legislation very clearly.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So just to clarify, as far as earnings being reported, we should expect the legislation to impact that one way or the other from our perspective. Do you follow me? Is that understanding that correctly?","Warner Baxter","Yes, you are understanding that correctly, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And we'll just wait till the 18th to see what happens.","Warner Baxter","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Paul Ridzon","Just a follow-up to Paul's question. If legislation would not to pass, would it require a rate case to decide -- to give the tax advantage back to rate peers?","Michael Moehn","Yes. And we would have to go through the normal rate proceeding process to figure that out and, ultimately, get that back to customers. That's correct.","Paul Ridzon","And would that be retroactive to January 1 of '18?","Michael Moehn","Yet to be determined.","Paul Ridzon","And then just now you've kind of added another $1 billion to the -- to potential on the top of wind if the legislation passes. Would this -- what could your rate base CAGR be? Would you just place some capital and reshuffle projects? Or would this be completely additive?","Martin Lyons","Paul, this is Marty. It would largely be additive. Look, we need to bring the wind into the portfolio for compliance with the Renewable Energy Standard. And we've said that to the extent that this legislation passes, we will invest more in the State of Missouri. We've talked frequently about this potential for $1 billion of investment over a 5-year period. So we said repeatedly, we will invest more in Missouri. We've not said exactly what that growth rate would be. And we said that, overall, as a company, we would step back, however, and take a holistic look at our capital expenditure plan. We may make some modification to our overall 5-year spending plan. But largely, this -- that $2 billion would be additive.","Paul Ridzon","So more patterns have been extending the growth rate. Okay. And then just on 564 in the House, what are the hurdles? And who could trip this up?","Warner Baxter","Paul, in terms of the hurdles, as I said at the outset, and I'll let Michael comment on some more of the specifics. It's gone through all the legislative committees. There are no more committee hearings to be had. It is on the House calendar. And it is ready to go to the floor when that House leadership chooses to have it go to the floor. And so Michael, any other commentary beyond that?","Michael Moehn","No, other than, again, just to reiterate that it has continued to experience, I think, strong bipartisan support. As Warner said, it's been through all the various committees, the House Utilities, House Rules. So it's on the calendar and can be debated at any time. And we certainly remain optimistic it will be debated with -- within the next week or so.","Warner Baxter","Because the bottom line, we've talked a lot about bipartisan support. I think it's important to recognize that key stakeholders from across the state support this legislation. And so at the end of the day, we remain hopeful that it'll have an opportunity to have this bill now and debated with [indiscernible] on the floor of the House by the end of the legislative session.","Paul Ridzon","In the past, I mean, it's similar legislation has enjoyed bipartisan support, but it only takes 1 or 2. Where are those parties now?","Michael Moehn","Well, look, I think that with the issues in the past, we've had difficulty getting Senate votes. This is a Senate Bill in the House. I think that's just important to recognize. So we did, going back to February, had a long filibuster and, ultimately, a good compromise and a bill that came out of the Senate, 25 to 6, again, a strong bipartisan support. And again, it's gone through the various committees. So we have never been this close, never been this far through the process. And so again, we remain hopeful that it certainly gets debated within the next week or so. I think the support is there for it. Clearly, the benefits are there for the State of Missouri in terms of what we've talked about in the income tax refund, obviously, the rate freeze, the rate cap, the investment in the State of Missouri, the creation of jobs, the economic development riders, et cetera.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","One Missouri question and then, actually, one for Illinois and then maybe a housekeeping one, so three in total. First, the Missouri question. Just bigger, broader, not just this legislation, but legislation in general. Has -- in the last 30 to 60 days, have any new bills made its way out of the House in the Senate and actually been signed by the Governor in the last 60 days or so?","Warner Baxter","So Michael, this is Warner. There has been a bill that went out on environmental matters that went out that was approved, but it hasn't been signed by the Governor. Michael, why don't you talk about the...","Michael Moehn","Warner's commenting on a bill that's specific to us. I mean, obviously, I think the State of Missouri continues to conduct its business. I think there's bills being passed, and I can't comment on what the Governor has signed or not signed. But I do know that the legislature can [indiscernible].specifically, as Warner said to us, we passed a bill related to some coal combustion residuals last week.","Michael Lapides","Okay. And that bill is awaiting the Governor's signature or has been signed and is now officially law.","Michael Moehn","It is awaiting the Governor's signature.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Want to ask a question about Illinois and the need for incremental transmission and\/or distribution investment. And I know you've kind of laid out your incremental -- your CapEx plan starting back in the fall for the next 5 years. But just curious, what are things that could move the needle on that plan, I mean, make that plan look very different this time next year versus what you show on the slide decks now? What are some of the things that could, \"Hey, we're not putting this into our CapEx guidance, but these are things in Illinois that could really change the CapEx outlook,\" either on the T side or the D side?","Martin Lyons","Yes. Michael, this is Marty. I think the -- look, our growth rates, as you know, are pretty robust in Illinois today. I mean, we've got 12.3% kind of growth rates for gas. We've got 8.4% for electric distribution. And our transmission business, overall, is growing at about a 12% compound annual rate. And there's a significant amount of that, that's actually in the Ameren Illinois business. So already growing at pretty good clips. As we look ahead, we do see a continuation of strong growth in all of those areas. In general, I'd say, there's still quite a bit of investment to be done for replacement of aging infrastructure, for reliability as well as capacity additions and safety. The electric business, obviously, substation, transformer replacements, underground replacements, line rebuilds, poor replacement, various grid modernization of the gas business, transmission replacement, regulator station rebuilds, coupled steel system and gas storage filled compressors, et cetera, so there's a lot of investment over the next 5 years and beyond, as it relates to those businesses.","Same thing transmission as it relates to aging structures, shield wire conductors, transformers, breakers, switches, et cetera. So there's a lot of components that are in need of modernization and it's -- that investment opportunity extends beyond the five years. I don't know if there's really anything specific to point to. We've been waiting for some new regulations in the gas business for some time now that may cause us to increase even further level of investment there we have in terms of modernization of our infrastructure. But certainly, the expenditures that we've got planned over the next 5 years and beyond should put us in a good position in terms of compliance with those rules. But that is one of the things, obviously, to look for as you think about future investment.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one last item, just a little bit of the housekeeping side. The expected planned outages or planned work in Missouri on the nonnuclear fleet, is that just a 2018 item? I think it's $0.11 or $0.12 headwind in 2018. Will all of that go away when we think about 2019, so it's just a -- it's a little bit of an incremental bump to '18, but it's kind of a once every 5 or 10 years' thing? Or will some of that drag into either '19, '20 and beyond?","Martin Lyons","Yes. What we're seeing there is, we took on more of that this year in light of the fact that there was no Callaway refueling outage. So in terms of that type of expense, I would expect to see that drop down as you move into 2019. But as I noted in February, I wouldn't really consider those to be onetime expenses, and I don't really think that we should look at those as something that's occurring this year, but won't reoccur next year. It's something that the amount varies from year to year. And I think you'd expect that we would do more of that in a non-Callaway refueling year. So I guess, bottom line is, Michael, I would expect some further expenses of that nature next year, but, perhaps, not at the level that we're seeing this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition Fund Management.","Ashar Khan","Marty, can I just understand one thing? I know we have the, under the legislation, certain price gaps, but is it fair to say that the investments that we would make, right, as part of the legislation and as well as part of the wind investment that have to be done in -- by 2020 that we should, as a shareholder, be expecting to get a return on those investments once they're fully in by the year, I guess, 2021 as we take on the wind and all that, so we should be able to -- on the earnings, as you show them on the book, be able to get a return on those investments as they are fully completed?","Michael Moehn","This is Michael Moehn. With respect to the caps, the 2.85% that you referenced, yes, I mean, the $1 billion incremental investment we've talked about, the wind investment, we are assuming all of those that underneath the 2.85% cap. And obviously, we'll have to continue to manage things closely as we have been from a discipled cost management side. But absolutely, you should be expecting a return on those investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","A quick follow-up. You said that Illinois gas benefited from some tax timing issues. How much was that?","Warner Baxter","Yes, Paul. it's a good question. It's, honestly, about $0.01 to $0.02 in terms of the timing impact.","Paul Ridzon","And that will reverse by the end of the year, yes.","Warner Baxter","Yes, exactly. So the natural gas segment earnings were up about $0.04. And like I said, $0.01 to $0.02 of that would reverse over the remainder of the year.","Paul Ridzon","And then the fossil outages that are going to be $0.11 for the balance of the year, should we think that those are -- in the shoulder months, we should those in the 2Q and 4Q?","Warner Baxter","Yes, yes. I think that's a fair assumption in terms of those overall expenses. When we talked -- when we gave our guidance in the beginning of the year and we said higher O&M in Missouri of $0.14 and we talked about the scheduled nonnuclear outages, which you're right, would generally occur in shoulder months. Also talked about timing of vegetation and management, routine line inspections, which would be more ratable for the year. But you're absolutely right as it relates to the outage cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel.","Kevin Fallon","Just a question for you on the transmission businesses. You have a thicker equity ratio at ATXI than you do at Ameren Illinois transmission. Is there any chance that you guys could increase the equity ratio at the -- at Ameren Illinois transmission up to the 56%? And if so, how do you have to do that?","Martin Lyons","Yes, Kevin. This is Marty. At -- the Ameren Illinois would really reflect the capital structure of that legal entity, so I would say to assume that going forward. And of course, it's a holistic business, Ameren Illinois with gas, electric and transmission. As we noted earlier, both in the gas and the electric distribution businesses, we're targeting a 50% equity ratio there in keeping with the agreements we have for ratemaking under both of those 2 areas. So again, Kevin, I would look, as you look ahead of today and in the future, I'd simply look at the equity ratio for the Ameren Illinois business overall.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the timing on a CapEx refresh, assuming a legislation in Missouri gets done by the 18th, when are you guys going to be in a position to actually refresh your outlook?","Warner Baxter","I think, Kevin, given the spot, obviously, we've reported out today, both in our prepared remarks and our Q&A sort of the status for the ongoing wind negotiations, they're again looking to file CCNs some by June 30, some by later in the year. We've updated you on the situation in terms of the legislation. Look, I mean, as we look ahead, I think it'd be reasonable to assume that we might update the plans as early as the third quarter call. But then, again, as has been more typical, we've done that in conjunction with our year-end call. So I think we will -- again, we're progressing well on both of those initiatives, but I think we'll let both of those things play out a little further and be thinking again, either late this year or early next in terms of an update.","Kevin Fallon","And just to clarify, on the legislative related to CapEx, you guys already have a line of sight of what you want to do, correct, like, you know what the projects are behind the $1 billion?","Michael Moehn","Yes. I mean, we filed a filing back in 2016 that outlined $1 billion. And I would say that we continue to refine that and make sure that we got exactly the right projects. But that gives you a pretty good glimpse on where we're headed on grid modernization.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Nitty-gritty tax reform question probably for Marty. Have you all quantified what the excess or unprotected accumulated deferred federal income tax is? And what the time horizon -- either on the Missouri bill or in something in the Illinois, what the time horizon is for refunding that level back to customers?","Martin Lyons","Michael, probably in the details with the regulatory filings, those things are probably embedded. But I'll be honest with you, off the top of my head, I don't have that number. And I do think that the actual timing of the flowback is somewhat still up in the air as it relates to -- especially in Missouri where we don't yet have a definitive time line on -- or amount that would be flowing back to customers. So that's something, Michael, I just don't have at the top of my head. We can see if we can provide that to you over time. But I don't think either -- that we have it in our 10-Q that we plan to file, either. So that's maybe something we'll have to provide you over time.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Fischer for closing comments.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you. Thank you for participating in this call.

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced 2018 core earnings of $3.37 per share compared to $2.83 per share earned in 2017. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2018 results in few minutes. I'd like to highlight some key accomplishments that are indicative of our team's strong performance in 2018 and importantly that will position Ameren for success in years ahead.","As you can see from this slide, we were very busy in 2018. 2018 marked another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy across all of our businesses. Our strategy is to invest in rate-regulated energy infrastructure continuously improve operating performance and adequate responsible energy policies to deliver superior customer and shareholder value. Our customers are at the center of our strategy.","Simply put, we're focused on meeting our customer's energy needs and exceeding their expectations and in so doing, delivering superior shareholder value. With these objectives in mind, we made $2.3 billion of investments in 2018 it resulted in a more reliable, resilient and secure energy grid. As well as strong rate base growth and we were pleased to be able to pass onto customers in a very timely fashion, the savings from the lower federal income tax rate.","In 2018, we also achieved constructive outcomes in many regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional investments for the benefit of customers and shareholders. I was also pleased by the fact, that many of these constructive regulatory outcomes were supported by strong collaboration with key stakeholders which ultimately resulted in agreements on the key issues. In our Illinois businesses, we received approval from the Illinois Commerce Commission on our electric delivery and natural gas rate reviews consistent with our request.","In addition, we were pleased with the FERC's decision to allow for 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for Mark Twain due to the unique nature of the risks involved in that project. We also received approvals for several Ameren Missouri customer focus program including the third energy efficiency plan as well as renewable choice and community solar programs both of which will allow customers to work with Ameren Missouri to procure greater levels of renewable energy in a cost effective manner.","We see these achievements as a big win for our customers and the environment, yet our biggest achievements in 2018, related to the significant progress we made in advancing energy policy to support significant increment electric grid modernization investments in Missouri as well as the progress we made in responsibly transitioning to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio with the announcement of significant investments in Missouri.","The enactment of Senate Bill 564 marks a step changes in Missouri's energy policy to enable investment to modernize the energy grid and drive economic development in the state. And our planned acquisition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation consistent with Missouri's renewable energy standard will drive significant incremental investments in renewable energy. I will cover both of these important strategic opportunities in more details shortly.","The bottom line is, we now have constructive regulatory frameworks in all of our jurisdiction which allows us to allocate significant amounts of much needed investment to each of our business segments by the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. As I said a few minutes ago, we accomplished a great deal in the execution of our strategy in 2018 with regard to significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","I think it's important to note, that our team's strong execution of our strategy in 2018 was not an aberration. As you can see on Page 5 of our presentation, we have been laser focused on executing the same strategy for the last five years. Our successful execution of this strategy has transformed our business mix deliver significant value to our customers and shareholders. Position the company for success in the years ahead.","In particular, consistent with regulatory frameworks the supported investment in energy infrastructure we invested approximately $10 billion over the last five years. Slide 5, highlights some of the investments we've made during this period. Since 2013, we've improved the safety and reliability of our electric and natural gas systems, improved the efficiency of our energy centers, enhanced our environmental footprint and strengthened our cyber security posture.","At the same time our relentless focus on disciplined cost management has kept our electric rates affordable and very competitive. As they remain well below the Midwest and national average. We've also been very active and successful and working collaboratively with key stakeholders in Missouri and Illinois on implementing constructive energy policies in all of our jurisdictions to support ongoing and future investment in energy infrastructure.","And we've been capitalizing new opportunities for our investment most notably those associated with transmission projects and plan when generation in Missouri. All of these actions when taken together resulted in the successful execution of our strategy which will deliver significant value to our customers and shareholders. Our investments over the last five years have driven robust, compound annual rate base growth of approximately 8%, that growth coupled with improved earned returns drove a strong compound annual earnings per share growth of more than 7% over the same period.","We also grew our common dividend during this time period and improved our overall business risk profile. Combined these actions also resulted in strong total shareholder returns over the same five-year period. I want to be clear, we do not take these results for granted. Achieving these results require a great deal of hard work, persistence and team effort. Why I'm pleased with what we've accomplished I'm even more excited about the fact that the execution of our strategy has positioned us very well to continue to deliver superior customer and shareholder value in the future.","Which brings me to Page 6 of our presentation and discussion of our earnings growth expectations for the next five years. We expect our 2019 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. Earnings within this range will deliver strong growth again in 2019, as the midpoint of this guidance represents nearly 7% earnings per share growth compared to 2018 weather normalized core results.","Marty will provide you with more details on our 2019 guidance a bit later. [Indiscernible] our robust earnings growth over the past several years I'm also pleased to announce that we have rolled forward our long-term guidance. Last February, we guided to our 5% to 7% compound annual earnings per share growth rate for the 2017 to 2022 period. For the 2018 to 2023 period, we've increased that range and now expect strong 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth using 2018 weather normalized core earnings of $3.05 per share as base.","This base excludes Ameren Missouri's estimated favorable weather, impact of $0.32 per share from 2018 core earnings per share of $3.37. This long-term earnings growth outlook was driven by continued execution of our strategy including investing in infrastructure for the benefits of customers while keeping rates affordable. This outlook also accommodates a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments.","And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews, Callaway refueling and maintenance outages, and weather, among other factors. I would also note that Callaway refueling outage is scheduled for 2023. In contrast, we did not have a Callaway refueling outage in 2018. We believe the best way to assess our long-term earnings growth is to normalize for the timing of Callaway refueling costs as well as weather impacts. That said, our earnings guidance range accommodates the inclusion or exclusion of 2023 Callaway refueling outage cost.","Turning now to Page 7, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 8% compound annual rate for the 2018 through 2023 period. Our plan includes allocating significant capital to all four of our business segments as they now all have - operating jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks for our investments. This is reflected in the expected rate base growth for each of these businesses as noted in the graph on the right side of this page.","Importantly, our five-year earnings and rate base growth projections include significant investments to modernize the electric grid, as set forth in Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan which we follow with Missouri PSE earlier this morning. Enabled by the enactment of Senate Bill 564, the Smart Energy Plan includes $6.3 billion of investment over the next five years with a specific focus on modernizing the grid and acquiring renewable wind generation.","Specifically, it includes approximately $1 billion of Ameren Missouri's wind generation investment related to the announced bill transfer agreements for up to 557 megawatts. The incremental grid modernization and announced wind generation investments increased Ameren Missouri's compound annual rate base growth of 3.5% and last year's five-year plan to 7.8% and our five-year plan announced today. It is important to note, that any additional wind generation investments would be incremental to this capital plan. And our plan continues to call for our investment and at least 700 megawatts of wind generation.","Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable and keep earned returns close to the allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions. Moving now to Page 8, as previously noted today Ameren Missouri filed its Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission driven by the enactment of constructive legislation in 2018. This five-year plan includes significant investments to modernize the energy grid and enhance how customers receive and consume electricity, while at the same time keeping electric rate stable and predictable.","Constructive energy policies have driven similar investments and benefits and adding thousands of new jobs to the State's economy while also keeping customer rates affordable. Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan filing includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2019 and sets forth the improvements and upgrades to modernize the energy grid infrastructure to benefit customers and offer more tools to manage their energy usage.","Upgrades and reliability, resilience and service throughout Ameren Missouri's 24,000 square mile service territory are the foundation of the plan that includes more than 2,000 electric infrastructure improvements projects across the state. This plan also includes major renewable energy projects to continue the transition to a cleaner generation portfolio and a responsible fashion for our customers.","This slide highlights several key elements of the five-year Smart Energy Plan. The Smart Energy Plan meets our customer's desire for stable and predictable rates. A smarter energy grid that is even more reliable, resilient and secure. New sources of clean energy and greater tools to manage their energy usage. In addition to the 6.1% rate decrease last August for the lower federal income tax rate. Customers will also benefit from a rate freeze until April 2020 and a 2.85% compound annual cap on electric rate increases from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2023.","Several cost reductions opportunities are expected to provide headroom to stay under this rate cap including the benefit of tax reform, lower fuel and transportation cost. Refinancing long-term debt at lower rates and expected O&M savings through technological improvements and disciplined cost control. In addition, we will seek to drive greater economic development in Missouri with a meaningful incentive rate enabled by Senate Bill 564 for new or expanding large energy users.","We look forward to working the Commission and other key stakeholders to implement the benefits of the Smart Energy Plan as we transform the energy rate of today to power the quality of life and build a brighter energy future for generations to come.","Moving now to Page 9, for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. Today I'm pleased with the progress we've made to pursue ownership of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020. Specifically, Ameren Missouri has reached agreements with two developers to acquire after construction of the 557 megawatts of wind generation representing about 80% of our compliance needs.","The proposed 400-megawatt facility to be located in Northeast Missouri was approved by the Missouri PSE last October and when built, will be the largest ever in the state. The next key milestone is the MISO transmission interconnection agreement which is expected in the fall of 2019. For the proposed 157-megawatt facility to be located in Northwest Missouri, a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement was reached earlier this month with the Missouri PSU staff and other parties on our CCM request.","The Missouri PSU decision is expected by May 1 of this year representing approximately $1 billion investment and are expected to be in service by the end of 2020. Of course, we're not done. Our team continues to actively negotiate with several developers for additional win generation. And as I noted earlier, any additional investments in wind generation will be incremental to the capital and rate base growth plan I discussed previously.","We remain confident in our ability to complete these negotiations, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and have these facilities constructed in a timely fashion. We believe these investments will clear, long-term benefits to our customers, the environment and the communities we serve. Turning now to Page 10, as we look to the future the successful execution of our five-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2023 but is also designed to position Ameren for success for the next decade and beyond.","We believe that the energy grid will be increasingly important as we expect Ameren and our industry to be critical enablers of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we're making investments though positioned to meet our customer's future energy needs and rising expectations, support increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes and provide safe and reliable natural gas services.","Right side of this page, shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our energy delivery businesses to approximately three quarters of our rate base by the end of 2023. In addition to focusing on investments in the energy grid, we're also committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Ameren Missouri's pursuit of at least 700 megawatts of wind by 2020 combined with the scheduled retirement of Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022 reflects this continued commitment.","As a result, our investment in coal and gas-fired generation is expected to be a combined 11% of rate base by year end 2023. The bottom line is that we're taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2019. The next five years. The next decade and beyond. Moving to Page 11, to sum up our value proposition we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2019 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. We believe the rate base and related earnings per share growth rates I just discuss compare very favorably with those of our regulated utility peers and I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies because we now have all four of our business segments operating with constructive regulatory frameworks to support investment.","That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. Further our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren's Board of Directors express its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximately 4%, the fifth consecutive year with a dividend increase.","For 2018, our dividend payout based on weather normalized earnings was in the lower half of our expected payout range of between 55% and 70% of annualized earnings. Our strong earnings growth expectation outlined today positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook combined with our solid dividend which currently provides a yield of approximately 3% results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thanks Warren and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. Today we reported 2018 GAAP earnings of $3.32 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $2.14 per share for the prior year. As outlined in the table on this page excluding the 2018 and 2017 non-core non-cash charges for the revaluation of deferred taxes of $0.05 and $0.69 per share respectively. Ameren reported core earnings of $3.37 per share for 2018 compared to core earnings of $2.83 per share for 2017.","Turning to Page 14, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.54 per share increase in 2018 core earnings compared to 2017 results. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment and also the largest driver of the year-over-year earnings increase experienced an increase of $0.50 per share from $1.48 per share in 2017 to $1.98 per share in 2018. This earnings improvement was largely driven by higher electric retail sales which contributed approximately $0.42 per share.","The higher electric sales were primarily due to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in 2018 compared to near normal summer and milder winter temperatures in the year ago period. In addition, the earnings improvement was higher electric service rates effective April 1, 2017 as well as the absence in 2018 of a Callaway energy center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. Each contributed approximately $0.09 per share to 2018 compared to 2017.","These favorable earnings drivers were partially offset by a planned increase in other operations and maintenance expenses primarily reflecting higher than normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outages, increased routine maintenance work and additional distribution reliability projects. Turning to the other segments, earnings for Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were up $0.09 and $0.03 respectively reflecting increased infrastructure investments.","In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distributions earnings benefited from higher allowed return on equity under formally [indiscernible] making of 8.9% compared to 8.7% for the prior year. The 2018 allowed ROE was based on the 2018 average 30-year treasury yield of 3.1% up from the 2017 average of 2.9%. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.04 reflecting increased infrastructure investments and higher rates effective in early November, 2018.","Finally, Ameren parent and other results reflected higher charitable donations, lower net state and federal tax benefits and dilution. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for 2018 compared to 2017. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up 1% excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under EMEA.","Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers also increased about 1% after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude EMEA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency at half percent and kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial increased 2%. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter cost do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.","Moving to Page 15 of the presentation. Here we provide an overview of our approximately $13.3 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2019 through 2023 period by business segment that underlies the 8% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. Note, the capital expenditures and rate base shown on this include Ameren Missouri's approximately $1 billion wind generation investment for up to 557 megawatts related to its announced build-transfer agreements. And the addition of wind generation investments would be incremental to this investment plan.","Turning to Page 16, looking ahead we will remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're comfortable with the current capitalization levels at each legal entity and expect our capitalization levels over the coming five-year period to remain in line with those at the end of 2018. Consistent with that expectation, here we outline the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page.","We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals and driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflecting customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers [indiscernible]. I should note, that over the five-year time horizon of our plan we do not expect to be a material, federal or state cash tax payer.","In addition to the benefit of accelerated tax depreciation because of our expected $1 billion investment and up to 557 megawatts of wind generation we also expect to generate production tax credits beginning in the 2020 timeframe. From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt to refinance maturing obligations and to fund a portion of our cash requirements. We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the five-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually.","Our plans also include incremental common equity to fund a portion of Ameren Missouri's expected wind generation investment. We believe these action should enable us to maintain the strong balance sheet and credit ratings that we've worked hard to achieve overtime. Moving to Page 17 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2019 earnings guidance.","As Warner stated, we expect 2019 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range represents nearly 7% EPS growth versus 2018 weather normalized core results. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2019 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2018 results.","Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to be lower in 2019 largely due to an approximately $0.32 per share benefit from favorable weather in 2018. We also expect expenses for the spring 2019 scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to decrease earnings by approximately $0.09 per share. Recall that there were no refueling outage for Callaway in 2018 given that these scheduled outages occur on an 18-month cycle.","Further, higher depreciation expense will decrease earnings approximately $0.03 which reflects the full year application of Plant-In-Service Accounting or PISA to a higher level of infrastructure investments. Partially offsetting these unfavorable earnings drivers, we expect lower interest expense of approximately $0.05 per share including the PISA benefit. We also expect lower other operations and maintenance expenses to benefit 2019 earnings by approximately $0.05. This reduction is primarily driven by higher than normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outages and increased maintenance work experienced in 2018.","Finally in Ameren Missouri, we expect higher electric margins including benefits under EMEA. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2019 compared to 2018 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula rate making. Our guidance incorporates a formula based allowed ROE of 8.9% using a forecast 3.1%, 2019 average yield for the 30-year Treasury bond which is comparable to an allowed ROE of 8.9% in 2018.","We've provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE of the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment on this page. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Distribution earnings we expect to benefit from a full year of increased delivery rates as well as qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider.","Turning to Page 18, Ameren Transmission earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC's formula rated making. Our guidance assumes continuation of the current 10.82% allowed ROE for the full year of 2019 which includes 50 basis point adder from MISO participation except for the Mark Twain project which assumes allowed ROE of 11.32%.","We've provided the earning's sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE of the Ameren Transmission segment on this page. Moving now to Ameren [indiscernible] drivers and assumptions, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 19% this year a decrease from last year's core effective income tax rate of 21%. This reflects the full year impact of excess deferred tax flow back in customer rates that began during 2018.","Additionally, we expect lower donations of the parent company of about $0.03 per share. Finally, the issuance of common shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.02 per share. I would also like to take a moment to discuss our electric sales outlook. We expect weather normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be up approximately 0.5% to 1% compounded annually over the five-year plan excluding the effects of our EMEA energy efficiency plans.","We expect sales to our Missouri industrial customers to be relatively flat over our five-year plan after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. Again, we exclude EMEA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Turning to Illinois, we expect our weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers including energy efficiency to be flat over our five-year plan.","Moving now to Page 19 for a discussion of select regulatory matters. For Ameren Transmission there have been recent development that may impact the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners. In November 2018, the FERC issued an order in the MISO ROE complaint cases proposing new methodology for determining the base allowed ROE and soliciting feedback from participants. The MISO Transmission owners including Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed initial briefs yesterday regarding the MISO complaint cases.","In summary, we believe the FERC proposed methodology is an improvement over the existing approach with certain recommended modifications. We're unable to predict the timing and ultimate impact of the complaint cases at this time. Turning to Page 20, for an update on cash flow guidance. For 2019, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $950 million. On the right side of this page we provide a breakdown of our $2.4 billion of planned 2019 capital expenditures by business.","We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities primarily through a combination of short and long-term debt borrowings and issuances. As well as the previously mentioned issuances of common shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. Finally, turning to Page 21 I will summarize, we delivered solid core earnings growth in 2018 capping five years of outstanding compound annual earnings growth. We expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2019 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy.","And as we look ahead, we expect strong 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth over the 2018 to 2023 period driven by an approximately 8% compound annual rate base growth and disciplined financial management. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend.","In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to our peers. That concludes our prepared remarks, we now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Campanella","This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien.","Warner Baxter","No worries, how are you doing this morning?","Nick Campanella","Very good, congrats on the update here.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Nick Campanella","I just want to start quickly on the incremental equity funding for the wind. This is with an excess of the drift. Can you just expand at all in terms of the magnitude of the funding you did there, how we should think about quantifying that whether it's from solving for an FFO to debt metric or just in terms of how you plan to finance it?","Marty Lyons","Good morning Nick. This is Marty. I think it's probably good to step back and look at the totality of what we said, what we said on prior calls. We feel very good about the capitalization levels that we have today meaning the debt to equity ratios and that's both that parent as well as the various legal entities that we have and we're going to seek to keep levels in line with those or approximating those levels over the five-year guidance period. We believe we can do that given the retained earnings associated with our ongoing operations and some equity financing as we noted on the call.","So the equity financing comes in two parts, I mean one of it that we noted is through the dividend reinvestment employee benefit programs. There we think we can generate about $100 million a year of equity proceeds or about 500 over the period. And then we expect to issue some additional equity in amount which equates to a portion of our ultimate wind investment as we mentioned on the call, that amount being sized to achieve the capital structure objectives that we talked about earlier.","So - look I recognize you're maybe looking for a little bit more specificity, but as we think about what we said and we think about the wind. I'd also ask you to think about how Ameren Missouri is financed overall today which is about 52% equity knowing that the wind ultimately is going to end up in that legal entity.","Nick Campanella","Appreciate that. And then just like the timing of the wind CapEx, that should all be realized in one-year roughly, is that correct?","Marty Lyons","Nick, I think it's a good way to think about it. The 557 megawatts that we've announced today we're going to acquire through build-transfer agreements so there again we look for those deals to close between the middle of 2020 and end of 2020 and so I would be thinking about the cash flows occurring during that period of time.","Nick Campanella","Great and then my last question, just on sticking with Missouri. I think you had a net $1.5 billion increase in the five-year program. I saw that you filed I think grid mod plan and can you just talk about your expectations for grid mod versus the prior - your previous expectations for the $1 billion and if that has shifted it all?","Marty Lyons","Maybe I could talk a little bit about the overall investment picture, which is on the Slide 15 and then see if, you have some follow-up questions or we can elaborate in some way. In overall, we had a previously a plan of 2018 to 2022 obviously when you're rolled forward you're not only just spending within those periods but mid also, we're looking out to 2023. And so overall its $13.3 billion plan for the five-year period looking ahead. If you compare to the prior plan I think what you'd find is, as we've said we have a strong pipeline of growth in each of our segments and so as you look at the capital spend and the update four to five-year period for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Transmission. Those are all pretty consistent with the levels of investment that we made - we're planning for the prior five-year plan that we've given the real updates there. And I think, long - it should meet with generally expectations as we've added $1 billion for Ameren Missouri wind generation investment. This $1 billion is really associated with 557 megawatts that we've announced to-date.","And then getting to your point, the capital expenditure plan outside of that wind for Missouri's $5.8 billion which compares favorably to the plan we had before which was $4.3 billion over five-year so, again it is $1.5 billion over the five-year period as you mentioned of course for rolling forward to a future period and so in any event. I think you're absolutely right as you would have expected given Senate Bill 564 in the wind generation investment. The investment Missouri overall is up in the plan.","Nick Campanella","Thanks. Congrats again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robison. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","First question, I just wanted to clarify one of the remarks I think you made in your opening comments in regards to the 6% to 8% EPS CAGR that you have over the next five years. And correct me if I'm wrong, but did I hear it right the 8% CAGR would normalize for the Callaway outage and exclude that. Whereas the 6% would include that, did I hear that right? Or does the 8% also contemplate including the Callaway outage?","Marty Lyons","Good morning, this is Marty. Let me answer that. I think what we meant to say that Warner was saying is that, 6% to 8% range if you will would accommodate either inclusion or exclusion of the cost of the Callaway outage in 2023. Clearly we're planning for an outage in 2023, we had none in 2018. We think the best way to look at our earnings growth profile overtime is to normalize for things like the Callaway outage timing in weather. But we wanted folks to know that, whether you were thinking about earnings in 2023 including or excluding those costs that we believe, our earnings guidance range was such that would accommodate either.","Ali Agha","I see. Just to be clear, so including if we include those cost and keep them in there that could still get us to an 8% CAGR.","Marty Lyons","Well it would depend on other things. Again it's a range, so what I'm saying is if you could include the cost it still get you into that range. If you exclude the cost you're within the range but wasn't really commenting on whether you would get to the 8% or not. Ali, I think the way to think about is, the range accommodates a number of things meaning. It accommodates ranges of treasury rates, allowed ROEs, earned ROEs, various spending levels, regulatory decisions, sales levels, economic conditions, financing plans, all of those things so when we give out the range, the range accommodates all of those variables that may occur.","Ali Agha","Okay and second clarification as well Marty, so I think as you mentioned for the wind investments you're looking at completing those acquisitions mid-to-late 2020. And I'm assuming that to the extent as additional wind that comes in, that's also 2020 timeframe period. So when we think about additional equity should we think all of that, if required will be a 2020 event and all the other years we should model out $100 million a year or should we think differently. And also, for modeling purposes should we assume wind will be an earnings contributor and the incremental wind will be an earnings contributor in 2020.","Marty Lyons","Sure, Ali. Let me take those, I may take those little bit in reverse order. In terms of the wind as I mentioned one of things we want to get done as to get wind [ph] in 2020 working with the developers to make sure we take maximum advantage of the production tax credit. So with respect to the projects that we've announced to-date, the 557 megawatts as well as additional wind investments that we're pursuing that are not embedded in the current plans. In both cases, we're seeking to work with the developers to acquire projects that will get completed as I mentioned earlier in the second half of 2020.","So as you think about that, there would be some earnings impact in 2020 but it really would depend on when those projects went into service or when they get into rate base in 2020. And you really get to I think a more full annualized benefit of the wind when you get into 2021 and as you get through the rate cases associated with those even into 2022, but you're really going to get to a more full annualized benefit again in that 2021 timeframe.","Now as it relates to the equity, we talked about today we do expect incremental equity to fund a portion of the wind investment and so again those cash flows. You're right, occur in the 2020 timeframe so that's a consideration and then I would also say that, again we have not announced the - we aspire to acquire additional wind beyond the 557 and so as we complete those negotiations we'll be certainly thinking about financing that, in addition to what we've talked about, the wind we've announced to-date and will be thinking about the sizing in the way, that's consistent with what we discussed today and on prior calls.","Ali Agha","Okay and last question. I know in the past when you talked about the SB 564 related CapEx you had mentioned at a minimum $1 billion over five years and I guess based on your commentary today it looks like it's more than a $1 billion at least embedded in this five-year plan. Does that still leave you room for even additional upside to that CapEx as we think about this five years or do you think this is pretty much what you expect to spend now going forward?","Warner Baxter","Ali, this is Warner. Thanks for the question, I'll let Michael comment a little bit further because he filed the Smart Energy Plan. I'll just start with this saying that, the robust infrastructure plan that we talked about over five years and 10 years in Missouri as I sit here today. It still remains robust beyond just the five years and frankly it continues to grow with various needs. Michael, you can talk a little bit about what you've incorporated in the five-year plan and certainly some opportunities that you continue to see from Missouri.","Michael Moehn","Well I mean, I think Warner just adding a little bit to that I mean obviously we have the $5.3 billion that we filed today on the electric side. As we get in and develop those plan and be able to show all the customer benefits. It's obvious that we're finding just more opportunities. I think you described as a robust plan. I would say that is absolutely the case. And we look forward to continue to work through time and looking for projects that are going to provide meaningful benefit to customers.","Warner Baxter","So the bottom line, when you look back three years ago when we talked about the plan that was filed. We look at the grid modernization opportunities every bit as robust today as we looked at them back then three years ago.","Ali Agha","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Starting on the wind side, just to clarify by 2020 the 700 megawatts that you guys are targeting or at least 700 megawatts that implies I guess versus the current plan that you have today you'll have another around 150 megawatts at least announced in build-in transfer by 2020 or are you - when you're talking about negotiating with multiple developers are there opportunities beyond that 700 that you're talking about or is that largely it?","Michael Moehn","This is Michael Moehn, as we think about it today we're obviously very focused on that 700 megawatts for the Missouri renewable standard having that 15% by 2021. Obviously we're keeping our mind and options open as we move through time in terms of other offerings that we out there, but we're really focused on filling out, that 700 megawatts at this point.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And then on the cost side, I think in the past you've targeted not making formal guidance but I was trying to [indiscernible] growth slight on a year-over-year basis, is that still part of your plan?","Warner Baxter","Go on Marty, please.","Marty Lyons","Yes, Insoo this is Marty. As we look ahead I mean that continues to be our goal. I mean we recognize that one of our objectives is to make sure that we can carry out this $13.3 billion infrastructure plan for the benefit of our customers and keep rates affordable along the way. So we will look to keep tight control on our O&M cost as we look ahead.","Insoo Kim","Understood and then maybe just one more if I could. The recent electric vehicle decision, I know it's a fairly small part of your investment opportunity. But that decision for the five-year $4 million or so does that basically cap how much you're going to be spend in that arena at least for the medium term.","Michael Moehn","Again this is Michael, I would say it's a start with respect to what we're trying to do from a transportation perspective. We're excited about having the opportunity to build out this corridor. I think we'll continue to evaluate overtime. The commission has actually opened up a workshop to have some further conversations beyond just the charging corridor they approved, so that could all planned up including other types of charging as well. So we look forward to engaging in a discussion, see if we can move this discussion forward.","Warner Baxter","Mike, I'll just add. I think this is clearly a step forward and importantly I think what Mike and his team have been able to do is just raise the level of awareness and the conversation in the State of Missouri on this. And so this is what we have today, but dialog it will be ongoing here in the relative near future and we look forward to continue to lean further forward in the electrification because we think there are real opportunities and benefits for our customers in the State of Missouri and we will be looking at similar types of things frankly in the State of Illinois too because we see similar benefits over there as well.","Insoo Kim","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrd","Congratulations on a constructive update.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Stephen Byrd","So I just wanted to discuss the Smart Energy Plan filed in Missouri and just better understand the regulatory process and just how we think about where procedurally it goes from here. It's obviously great that, the customer bills [ph] are, the bill impact is capped. It seems to all makes sense but I just wanted to understand a little bit more about what we should be looking for, now that you've made that filing.","Warner Baxter","Sure, Michael why don't you talk about that? Because I know it's some of this is embedded in Senate Bill 564, so why don't you give an update there.","Michael Moehn","Perfect. Thanks for the question. Obviously it's an important filing that we did today with the commission. We're required to layout and quite a bit of detail for 2019 where our investments are going to go and then little less detail for the next four years through 2023. What else is contemplated, is public meeting that's scheduled for March 4 will again layout the customer benefits associated with this, where our investments are going etc and get some feedback from that.","And then obviously Senate Bill 564 didn't change the Commissions' authority anyway, so they'll have a chance to weigh in this as we go through regular rate reviews and have an opportunity to look at where we're making investments etc. so we look forward to engaging with them around this, getting feedback along the way.","Warner Baxter","Let me just add Stephen. When you look at the details of the plan. I think these are things that we've been talking about is needed in the State of Missouri frankly for many years and so I think what we've now provided is just greater levels of detail and as we referred to little bit earlier. Michael and his team have put together a plan three years ago almost now, that highlighted some of these things. So lot of dialog and conversations around these have been discussed before now we're giving a lot more detail, which I think is certainly appropriate at this time.","Michael Moehn","Yes that's right. I mean the other thing just to note is, we have been operating under this Senate Bill 564 really since September 1 and next thing you noted, the 6% rate reduction that occurred is part of the tax refund. We obviously had some solar rebates that we were required to do, all of that has been taken care of. We recently economic development rider approved. So I give you that, just because there are number of aspects that we have been executing underneath Senate Bill 564 for some time.","Stephen Byrd","And that all makes sense, it does seem consistent what you've talked about before. And just shifting over to Illinois, I guess there is some discussion of potential movement towards greater levels of clean energy in this state. I'm curios from your system perspective or just more broadly investment opportunities, changes to grid. Anything else that you foresee, if the state did in fact move towards greater levels of clean energy.","Warner Baxter","Sorry, Stephen it is Warner. And then Richard feel free to jump in. Big picture when you think about renewable generation we're not allowed to own renewable generation in State of Illinois. So we stay very mindful of the activities there because certainly since we purchased energy on behalf of our customers we want to make sure that rates continue to be good, as well as making sure that the reliability is spot through.","Having said that, Richard was at the table with key stakeholders during the Governor's transition period and they talked about transition plan around energy policy. One of things that we pointed out very clearly is that, the energy policy in the State of Illinois is working quite well and the formulate rates is working quite well and so, we see that there are investments opportunities associated with that and for our distribution business to make sure we can continue to deliver the safe reliable service for our customers, we will do so.","If we become more broadly in terms of renewable generation, certainly we will be thoughtful about transmission opportunities because we've said this before and we'll say it again when you look at the MISO footprint. There are lot of wind and solar projects going on in the MISO footprint and we stand ready and are able to help implement those, with not just in a connection agreements, but perhaps sometime down the road. There'll be an opportunity for multi-value projects. Early innings, but we could see that as a potential opportunity and so Richard, I know that you've been working with your team over there, anything that you would add to what I said.","Richard Mark","You covered it perfectly. I think that's really good observation of how it's going work.","Stephen Byrd","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from Kevin [indiscernible] with Citadel. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Just to clarify, is the implied cost for KW on the 557 megawatts wind, do you guys right now a reasonable proxy for what would cost you to get you up to the 700?","Michael Moehn","This is Michael Moehn, I think it's difficult, you got to be a little careful with it just because so many different factors apply here in terms of there's some benefits associated with doing projects in State. There's 1.25% credit versus outstay there's capacity factor issue, so you can probably draw some conclusions, we got to be a little careful with it, just in terms of some of the specifics.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. But the actual target amount is the 700 megawatts, correct?","Michael Moehn","That is what we're focused on.","Marty Lyons","Kevin, maybe I'll add to that though and build off of what Michael said into earlier. I mean hitting 700 neatly is a difficult thing to do. These projects vary in sizes. One of things we said, if you look closely at the wording we used, we said at least 700. It could be that the ultimate project that selected and picked would actually be, get us to a number that was above 700 because again it's difficult to find a site that neatly gets you to 700. So we think it's going to be at least 700. But the target again is to fulfil the requirements under the renewable energy standard, which we believe is would approximate about 700.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful. And the other thing is, I think a securitization build has been introduced in the Missouri legislature. I know you guys have said in the past, you have very low dispatch cost on your coal fleet. But if the securitization was past, would that change the dynamic there and kind of still for fuel type of outlook?","Michael Moehn","You're right, there are couple of securitization builds fooling [ph] around. Look I would just say, at a very high level and Marty can certainly add to this. I mean we're having some conversations with the stakeholders and none of those bills have been assigned to committee yet. So they had a hearing at this point, we look forward to continue to have some conversations around the details of these bills and what benefit there may or may not be there for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Are these bills being? Are you guys sponsoring these bills or supporting these bills? Or is that all just to be determined?","Michael Moehn","Yes that is all to be determined.","Unidentified Analyst","That's great. Well thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we reached the end of question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Andrew Kirk for closing comments.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you for participating in this call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Douglas Fischer, Director of IR for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may now begin.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m Doug Fischer, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Voss; our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Marty Lyons; and other members of Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet and the webcast will be available for one year on our website at www.ameren.com. Further, this call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast.

Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and financial performance.","We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in the forward-looking statements. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statement section in the news release we issued today, and the forward-looking statements and risk factors section in our filing with the SEC.","Tom will begin this call with an overview of 2011 earnings and 2012 guidance, followed by a discussion of recent business and regulatory developments. Marty will follow with more detailed discussions of 2011 financial results, our 2012 guidance and regulatory and other financial matters. We will then open the call for questions.","Here\u2019s Tom, who will start on page three of the presentation.","Tom Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Core earnings for 2011 were $2.56 per share in line with the increased guidance range we provided in November of last year. As expected, these 2011 results were below the $2.75 of core earnings per share achieved in 2010. This reflected lower electric sales to native load utility customers due in part to summer temperatures that while warmer than normal were below those very hot 2010.","In addition, merchant generation margins decline as a result of lower realized power and capacity prices, as well as higher fuel and transportation related expenses. These factors were offset in part by increased electric utility rates in Missouri and Illinois.","Further, core non-fuel operations and maintenances expenses were lower, reflecting continued disciplined cost management, and interest cost fell as we used our free cash flow over the last two years to reduce outstanding debt.","Beginning on page four you will find a list of our key accomplishments in 2011. These accomplishments are clear evidence of our commitment to providing customers with safe, reliable, environmentally responsible, and reasonably priced energy while at the same time enhancing value for our shareholders. To put these accomplishments into context it is important to summarize some of our key financial objectives.","At our regulated utilities, we seek to earn fair returns on our investments, which allow us to attract on competitive terms the capital we need to provide the level of service our customers expect. We are working around fair returns by maintaining solid operating performance while improving our regulatory frameworks and seeking rate release as needed.","Further we are committed to allocating capital to those projects on which we expect to earn fair returns and aligning our spending with regulatory outcomes and economic conditions. At our merchant generation business we seek to protect and enhance shareholder value by minimizing operating and capital spending during the current period of low power prices while advocating for regulatory policies and power market improvements that will lead to improved economics.","While I\u2019ll not touch on each of the 2011 accomplishments listed on pages four and five, I would like to summarize and highlight a few of our successes. At Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, we posted another year of solid distribution system reliability. At Ameren Missouri and our merchant generation business availability of our energy centers remained high.","Our restoration efforts following severe storms in both Missouri and Illinois won praise from government officials. In addition, in 2011, we actively pursued legislative and regulatory agendas that we expect will improve predictability and level of earned returns at our regulated utilities. The most notable development on this front was the enactment by the State of Illinois of legislation established on performance based formula ratemaking for electric delivery service. Further, we thought and obtained electric and gas rate increases in Missouri and a gas rate increase in Illinois, the latter of which was authorized in January of 2012.","Continuing on page five, at our merchant generation business we updated our environmental compliance strategy during 2011, leading to reductions in capital spending plans and expected future operating costs compared to our prior plans. Ameren Transmission Company also notched important successes allowing us to move forward with our plans to improve the region\u2019s electric transmission system and also create jobs. In May, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC approved requested constructive rate treatment for two transmission projects. And in December, the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO approved three major transmission projects.","On the financial front, we concluded another year of successful cost management with a decline in core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. In addition, we generated enough cash flow from operations to fund more than $1 billion of investments. And the common dividend while also reducing outstanding borrowings and more than 85% of these investments were for infrastructure at our regulated utilities.","Finally, in October of 2011, Ameren\u2019s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common dividend by3.9% per share.","Moving now to page six in a forward focus, today we announced 2012 GAAP and core earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. The projected decline in 2012 core earnings per share compared to 2011 is primarily due to expected lower margins at our merchant generation business and an assumed return to normal temperatures. These factors are expected to be partly offset by increased utility rates as well as reduced non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses in Missouri.","Turning to page seven on pending regulatory matters, in January of 2012, Ameren Illinois elected to participate in Illinois\u2019 new performance based formula ratemaking process for electric delivery service by making an initial filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. As a result, we expect Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric delivery earnings in 2012 and beyond to reflect formula ratemaking, which will enable us to invest in a state improving infrastructure and creating jobs. The improved infrastructure will enhance reliability and provide customers with the energy usage options made possible by smart meters.","Turning to Missouri, we are focused on modernizing the existing regulatory framework. Our modern regulatory framework that allows us to recover and earn fair returns on our investments on a timely basis, will improve our ability to bring aging infrastructure up to 21st standards, allowing us to meet customer expectations and create jobs.","Earlier this month, Ameren Missouri filed an electric rate case with the Missouri Public Service Commission seeking to recover its operating and capital costs and to earn a fair return on investments it has made to serve its customers. Marty will provide details of the filings in a few minutes.","However, I would like to highlight two proposals we have made in this case to enhance the existing regulatory framework. First, we are seeking approval of a storm cost tracking mechanism that wd provide the opportunity to recover costs to restore service after major storms in a manner that is fair to both our customers and our investors. Second, we are seeking approval of a new plant-in-service accounting proposal. This proposal is designed to reduce the impact of regulatory lag on earnings and future cash flows related to assets placed in service between rate cases.","In addition to the pending electric rate case, in January 2012 Ameren and Missouri filed its first request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for approval of new and expanded energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Our proposed energy efficiency programs are expected to provide significant long-term benefits to our customers. The energy efficiency legislation was designed to enable utilities to pursue cost effective energy efficiency programs by requiring that the regulatory framework properly align the utility\u2019s financial incentives with those of customers. Ameren Missouri\u2019s ability to move forward with these proposed energy efficiency programs will require a regulatory frame work consistent with this legislation. And our energy efficiency proposal is consistent with the legislation and industry best practices.","Before I conclude my comments on pending regulatory matters, I want to mention that we support the MISO\u2019s filing at the FERC for an annual capacity construct, as a first step although we continue to advocate for a multi-year capacity construct to ensure properly functioning power markets. Further, we strongly support MISO\u2019s effort at FERC to increase the amount of capacity that can be shared across the MISO, PJM seen. Constructive action on these matters is the right thing for FERC to do because it\u2019d lead to prices that more accurately reflect the value of capacity, improve efficiency and reliability, and benefit customers over the long-term.","Turning to page eight. Our merchant generation business has produced positive free cash flows in recent years including over $200 million in 2011. This reflects the benefit of our forward power sales in hedging programs and actions we have taken to control spending. For 2012, we\u2019ve again sold forward or hedged nearly all of our expected 2012 merchant generation output at prices above current market levels.","As a result, we expect our merchant generation segment to be free cash flow positive in 2012 and for Genco with the benefit of existing money pool receivables to provide for its own cash needs.","As we look beyond 2012, we cannot ignore the potential negative impact of lower prices on our cash flows. As most of you are aware, since late 2011, there has been a sharp decline in forward power prices. We attribute this most recent price decline to the U.S. Court of appeals order staying the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR, as well as the recent decline in natural gas prices.","It is unclear to us exactly when legal and regulatory uncertainties related to CSAPR will be resolved and when natural gas and power prices will recover. This decline has prompted us to again revise capital spending plans for our merchant generation business. As a result, we have decided to immediately decelerate construction of the Newton scrubber project postponing installation until such time as the incremental investment necessary for completion is justified by the visible market conditions.","In addition, we are moving from our forward five-year expenditure plans to previously planned Edwards 3 helper electrostatic precipitator. We believe that these actions are the best path to ensuring appropriate returns on incremental environmental investments and achieving continued positive free cash flow at our merchant generation business segment during this period of low power prices.","We estimate that these actions will reduce 2012 through 2014 capital needs by a total of approximately $270 million compared to prior plans. As we work to ramp down the Newton Scrubber Project, we will do so in a manner that preserves the value of work commissioned to-date. We plan to take delivery and place the various completed components and materials into a safe store condition over the remainder of this year.","Thereafter, we\u2019ll perform minimal amounts of ongoing construction activity, such that when the economics merit completing the Newton Scrubber Project in earnest, we\u2019ll able to do so in an orderly and cost effective manner. We have already initiated discussions with our partners and vendors on the task, timelines, and cost, associated with decelerating the project.","Based on these discussions we have removed the vast majority of capital spending related to the Newton Scrubber Project from our 2013 and 2014 plans and we have reduced our expected 2012 spending level on the Newton Scrubbers to approximately $150 million reflecting work commissioned to-date. These developments highlight the critical need for a viable multiyear capacity market in the MISO region, as well as a need for portability of capacity between MISO and PJM.","The current state of uncertainty arising from low power prices and uncertain environmental rules has a potential in my view to negatively impact electric reliability within MISO and elsewhere in the nation.","Moving now to page nine, we remain very excited about our plans to symmetrically grow our investments in FERC regulated electric transmission projects. In fact, Ameren expects to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in such projects over the five-year period ending in 2016. Customer should benefit from improved reliability in a more efficient electric system. Our investors should benefit because we expect to earn fair returns on such investments.","At this time, we are investing in FERC regulated transmission through two different entities, Ameren Illinois Company and ATX. Ameren Illinois has significant opportunities to invest in projects that are focused on local load growth and reliability needs. This business expects to invest nearly $900 million in such projects over the five-year period. ATX plans to build Greenfield regional transmission projects initially within Illinois and Missouri and to invest approximately $750 million in such projects over the next five years.","In December of 2011, MISO\u2019s Board of Directors approved three of ATX projects as multi-value projects. These projects represent more than $1.2 billion of ATX investments over eight years and we are moving ahead with development of these projects. In fact, for the largest of these the $800 plus million Illinois Rivers project we are moving forward with the line routing and siting process.","I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Lyons","Thanks Tom. Turning to page 10 of the presentation, today we reported 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $2.15 per share compared to 2010 GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share. Excluding certain items in each year Ameren recorded 2011 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared with 2010 core earnings of $2.75 per share.","2011 core earnings exclude three items that are included in GAAP earnings. The first of these non-core items is employee separation charges related to the 2011 voluntary retirement offer, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share.","The second non-core item is $0.02 per share loss from the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market activity. The third of these full year 2011 non-core items is goodwill, impairment and other charges, taken into the third quarter of $0.32 per share. These charges were the results of Missouri Public Service Commission\u2019s disallowance of cost of enhancements related to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk Pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center as well as our decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville merchant generation energy centers.","Turning to page 11, here we highlight key factors driving the variance between core earnings per share for 2011 and 2010. Key factors adversely affecting the comparison include a decline in margins at our regulated utilities of $0.30 per share after excluding rate changes. We estimate that $0.13 of this decline was due to lower weather-normalized loads and $0.10 was primarily the result of temperatures that were below those \u2013 very hot 2010.","Another $0.05 of the decline was due to a second quarter 2011 charge, related to Missouri public service commission requirement that certain revenues be flow-through the fuel adjustment clause. A decline in margins at the merchant generation business reduced 2011 earnings by $0.21 per share. The reduced margins reflected lower realized power and capacity prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs.","Several severe storms in the first half of 2011 reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, with $0.06 of this related to Ameren Missouri and $0.03 related to Ameren Illinois. Key factors favorably impacting the comparison of 2011 core earnings to 2010 core earnings, included electric rate increases in Missouri and Illinois. Changes in electric and gas rates net of certain related expenses increased earnings by $0.23 per share. These rate changes included higher electric rates in Illinois effective in 2010, and an electric rate increase in Missouri effective in late July 2011.","The other key factor positively impacting earnings was lower core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which benefited 2011 earnings by $0.20 per share excluding the previously discussed storm restoration costs.","Turning to page 12, I would now like to discuss the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2012 earnings guidance for our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses of $2.20 to $2.40 per share.","In 2012, we expect to achieve an earned return on equity of approximately 9% to 9.6% on average regulated utility common equity of approximately $6 billion. This guidance assumes a return to normal weather reducing earnings by an estimated $0.16 per share compared to 2011 results. While 2011 summer temperatures were milder than those experienced in 2010, 2011 summer temperatures were much hotter than normal. Weather normalized margins are expected to increase as a result of the 2011 Missouri electric rate increase and the 2012 Illinois natural gas delivery rate increase.","Our guidance also reflects the implementation of the new formula ratemaking process for our Illinois Electric delivery business. Our earnings expectations for this business assume a formulaic midpoint allowed return on equity of 9.2%, which incorporates a forecasted 2012 average 30-year treasury yield of 3.3%. This treasury yield forecast is based on the blue chip consensus estimate as of February 1st, 2012.","Finally, our outlook for regulated margins assumes little growth in weather normalized electricity sales. Regulated utility earnings guidance for 2012 incorporates increased non-fuel O&M spending at our Illinois utility as we begin to implement our electric delivery modernization action plan. At our Missouri utility, we expect 2012 non-fuel O&M spending to be lower than that experienced in 2011.","Headcount in Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services declined by approximately 340 at the end of 2011 as a result of the voluntary retirement program. In addition, the absence of a scheduled refueling and maintenance average at the Callaway Nuclear Energy Center in 2012, is expected to lower O&M expenses by $0.10 per share. Callaway is refueled approximately every 18 months. Finally, we expect 2012 regulated earnings to be impacted by increased depreciation and amortization expenses.","Moving to page 13, let\u2019s now shift to a discussion of the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2012 earnings guidance for our merchant generation business. We expect this segment to post earnings of zero to $0.10 per share this year. The most significant driver of the expected earnings decline in 2012 compared to 2011, is a decrease in margins of $0.20 to $0.30 per share due to lower realized power and capacity prices and higher fuel and transportation related costs.","We expect our Merchant plans to generate approximately 27 million megawatt hours in 2012 with approximately 25 million megawatt hours of this sold or hedged at an average of $44 per megawatt hour. Our guidance assumes that un-hedged expected generation is sold at current market prices.","In 2012, we anticipate having available generation of up to 32.5 million megawatt hours from our coal-fired merchant generation energy centers in the event power prices rise and support higher generation levels. Our base load fuel and transportation related costs are about 93% hedged at approximately $24 per megawatt hour.","Finally, we project 2012 merchant generation non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses will be essentially flat with those of 2011 or approximately $290 million.","Regarding key Ameren wide assumptions, our earnings guidance reflects an effective consolidated income tax rate of approximately 36% and the number of common shares outstanding in 2012 is expected to average $242.6 million. In 2012, we plan to purchase shares on the open market for a dividend reinvestment in 401-K plans. During the past several years, we have issued new shares to fund these plans.","As I close our discussion of 2012 earnings guidance, I\u2019ll remind you that any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings, but are excluded from our GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.","Core non-GAAP earnings and guidance also exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Further, earnings guidance are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in the forward-looking statements section of today\u2019s press release.","Turning then to page 14, we provide both our actual 2011 and projected 2012 cash flow information. As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our cash flows from operating activities and subtracting from it our capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends and net advances for construction.","In 2011, free cash flow reached $381 million, $56 million more than our November guidance. For 2012, we anticipate free cash flow will be negative by approximately $230 million. The decline in free cash flow primarily reflects lower cash flow from operations and higher capital spending plans. Cash flow from operations is expected to decline in 2012 compared to 2011, as a result of lower projected core earnings at our merchant generation segment, reduce tax refunds and greater utility spending subject to deferred rate recovery amongst other matters.","The higher 2012 capital expenditures reflect increased expected spending primarily at our regulated utilities. We anticipate that our merchant generation business will be free cash flow positive in 2012 despite expected lower earnings and higher capital expenditures. Our only material long-term debt maturity in 2012 is $173 million senior secured note at Ameren Missouri.","Moving now to page 15, impending rate cases. As Tom mentioned, in January Ameren Illinois made its initial filing under the new performance based formula rate making framework for its electric delivery business. This initial filing is for a $19 million annual rate decrease because it is based on 2010 cost. This rate change is to be effective in late October 2012. However, 2012 electric delivery service earnings will reflect a true-up for 2012 year-end rate base and 2012 actual cost of service, and include historical ICC rate making adjustments. The allowed return on equity will be based on the prescribed formula I discussed earlier.","Moving to page 16, in Missouri, in February we filed for $376 million increase in annual electric rates with the Missouri PSC. The filing incorporates a 10.75% return on equity, a 52% equity ratio and rate base of $6.8 billion. $103 million of this request is related to higher net fuel cost. Note that 95% of these higher net fuel cost would be reflected in fuel adjustment clause or FAC rate adjustments absent this filing.","The request also includes $81 million to recover the annual cost including revenues to offset throughput disincentives of the three-year energy efficiency programs, Ameren Missouri proposed in its MEEIA filing which Tom mentioned earlier. As he stated, our ability to move forward with our proposed energy efficiency programs will require a regulatory framework consistent with the energy efficiency legislation.","In addition to recovery of higher fuel cost and cost associated with our proposed energy efficiency programs, the rate request includes recovery of investments made to improve the reliability of our aging infrastructure and to comply with renewable energy regulations as well as other cost increases. A PSC order is expected in December of 2012 with new rates expected to be effective in January of 2013.","On page 17 we detail our new five-year regulated utility capital expenditure outlook. In 2012, we plan to invest approximately $1.2 billion and over the four-year period, from 2013 through 2016 the midpoint of aggregate capital spending is projected to be approximately $5.7 million with an annual target range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","The environmental expenditures embedded in this outlook are those required to meet current environmental rules and regulations including the State CSAPR and the recently issued MATS as well as our assessment of the likely impact of the coal combustion by product rules.","The pie chart on the right side of this page breaks down our five-year regulated capital spending plan by business segment and activity. A little less than half is for Missouri with almost 30% targeted for our Illinois electric and gas delivery businesses, and almost a quarter slated for FERC regulated transmission projects. The Illinois regulated capital spending numbers reflect additional investments to modernize its electric distribution system as required by our participation in Illinois performance based formula rate program.","Moving now to page 18, here we provide an update on our 2012 and 2013 forward power sales and hedges and introduce our 2014 hedge data for our merchant generation business. As you can see we have significant hedges in place at power prices greater than current market levels.","We already discussed our 2012 power hedges. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 14 million megawatt hours at an average price of $40 per megawatt hour, further for 2014, we have hedged approximately 7 million megawatt hours at an average price of $44 per megawatt hour. To assist you and understanding our merchant generation business segment\u2019s margin drivers, we have provided a pie chart that breaks down our 2012, expected revenue by type.","Turning to page 19, here we update our merchant generation segment\u2019s fuel and related transportation hedges. We previously discussed our 2012 fuel hedges. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 12 million megawatt hours at about $25.50 per megawatt hour. For 2014, we have hedged approximately 5 million megawatt hours, also at about $25.50 per megawatt hour. Similar to our previous slide detailing merchant generation revenues, we\u2019ve included a pie chart that breaks down forecasted 2012 all in fuel cost to provide a perspective on how each component contributes to our overall cost.","On our final page, number 20, we outlined capital expenditures for our merchant generation business for each of the next five years, showing the breakdown between expenditures for maintenance and for environmental compliance.","As Tom mentioned, in light of current forward power and capacity prices as well as uncertain environmental regulations, we are decelerating construction of our Newton Scrubber project and removing the Edwards Helper Electrostatic Precipitator from our five-year spending forecast.","The estimated environmental expenditures in 2012 include approximately $150 million of spending on the Newton Scrubber project. And capital expenditures in 2013 through 2016 assume approximately $20 million per year of ongoing external construction costs for this project. Newton Scrubber project related capitalized interest and overheads are not included in the 2013 through 2016 numbers.","As you can see on this page, projected environmental expenditures are quite limited over the 2013 through 2016 period. Of course, we will continue to review and adjust our merchant generation spending plans in light of evolving outlooks for power and capacity prices delivered fuel cost, environmental standards and compliance technologies among other factors.","This completes our prepared remarks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Thank you our first question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning, can you hear me?","Martin Lyons","Yeah, Paul. This is Marty Lyons. Yes, we can hear you now.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Listen I want to ask you...","Martin Lyons","I apologize.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","That\u2019s fine. I just want to ask about these the delay in these merchant generation CapEx projects one in Newton and the precipitator. Is there a operating earnings impact that\u2019s associated with any of these MEEIAs which do you have to buy emissions or anything, I mean is there any operational issue we should be thinking about in terms of this significant change in CapEx.","Martin Lyons","Right Paul. I understand. It\u2019s Marty still. No, not in the near-term, these projects really design to help with compliance really when you get out into the 2015 timeframe so, in the near-term really no impact on operating earnings or cash flows as a result of decelerating the projects.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay and then with respect to just the capital expense itself delaying this and what have you, is there any change in terms of the total capital expense that you would be expecting?","Martin Lyons","Well I guess that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s teasing to tell I guess whether the ultimate cost of the project will change but just to give you a sense, so with respect to the Newton Scrubber project through the end of 2011, we had invested about $100 million roughly in that project.","As we said on the call this coming year as we decelerate the project, we do plan to take materials that have been built or material that have been commissioned a lot of those to be completed take those to the site, put them in a safe store condition. So we expect to incur about another $150 million this year in doing that. At that point we\u2019ll be taking the capital expenditures down to more of the minimum levels that we described in the call and continued to monitor changes in power market conditions, capacity markets, changes environmental rules and the like. And certainly asses how we might absence reacceleration of that project go about complying with environmental rules out in that 2015 timeframe.","But I think Paul when you look back to the guidance we gave last fall, I think the total project cost that was sort have embedded in the guidance was somewhere around $490 million for the Newton Scrubber project. If we move to reaccelerating it some point in the future, we\u2019ll certainly provide an update on what we think the costs are that time to complete the project. We are estimating as we sit here today if we were to reaccelerate the project at some point in the future, it would probably take in the range of say 20 months to 24 months to complete the project.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Martin Lyons","You are welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Martin Lyons","Yes, we can. Julien, this is Marty. Thanks for joining.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Yes, of course. I just wanted to clarify a little bit more on the Merchant CapEx front, just what you\u2019re thinking about compliance with MATS and your own Illinois State specific standards, 2015 and beyond, I mean, status quo I would imagine that it would result in some sort of operational impairment of the assets rate without putting in the CapEx, I mean there is some sort of reaction in your ability to dispatch some certain units? Is that the right way to think about that?","Martin Lyons","Yeah Julien. This is Martin again. That\u2019s a fair assessment. I think without the Newton Scrubbers being reaccelerate out in 2015 timeframe, it\u2019s frankly, it\u2019s really the Illinois multi-polluting standard that becomes the challenging standard for us to comply with. As you know out in that timeframe in our fleet wide SO2 emissions need to be reduced down in the 2015 timeframe. Between now and then, we really don\u2019t expect that we would have any forced reductions in generation levels as a result of CSAPR or multi-polluting standard or other rules.","When you get onto 2015, as it relates to MATS compliance, absent the Newton Scrubber we think we have other ways to comply activated carbon and precipitators, low sulfur coal and the like compliance there. And as it turns out with the CSAPR rules obviously they\u2019re uncertain right now because they\u2019ve been stayed. But based on the allowances that came out in the final rules, based on our decision to shutdown Meredosia and Hutsonville, the CSAPR rules really aren\u2019t seen as a significant limitation either.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. So if I were to kind of hit between lines here, frankly from a compliance perspective, a couple of years, you could decide, let\u2019s say, a couple of years down the road and still they\u2019ll move forward. You said 20 to 24 months there to complete the Newton Scrubber, so there is still a couple of years latitude all in give or take, is that kind of the right way to think about that in order to...","Martin Lyons","Yeah. That\u2019s fare. We feel like, as we decelerate today that we\u2019ve got some optionality for a while before what actually impact future general levels and in the meantime we can also look at how we might go about alternatively complying with some of those rules and again assess whether a reacceleration is appropriate.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent and then just a final question here on the Genco, a guidance the breakeven cash flow for this year. Are there any exceptional items there to bear in mind as we\u2019re looking at your EPS guidance translating then to free cash flow guidance anything notable to take note of?","Martin Lyons","I don\u2019t know that there is anything notable to take note of in the \u2013 in that regard as you reconcile.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Okay. So EPS guidance should equate to positive free cash flow?","Martin Lyons","Yeah. I think so. I mean nothing has come into mind off hand. We\u2019re certainly, as we mentioned in the call, we\u2019re expecting positive free cash flow overall at the Merchant business. And I guess one think of note early in this first quarter we did sell one of our assets with Medina Valley co-gen facility, a fairly small facility. I think about $17 million and cash flow coming from that. So, that may factor into our net CapEx for this year, but other than that earnings should translate into cash flow.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great and then just tiny clarification here in terms of your guidance that for coal. It seems like that came down a buck a megawatt hour in 2013, just wanted to clarify is that basically a lower PRB price or lower transport price.","Martin Lyons","Well, it\u2019s really a little off each Julien, so the price dropped I guess from about $26.50 to $25.50. We did increase the amount of transportation that we have hedged. We also increased the amount of coal we have hedged and as you saw a little bit of fuel surcharge, so frankly all three of those things would have gone into the mix.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Rebinoff with Fore Research and Management. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research and Management","Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me.","Martin Lyons","Yeah, we are little bit flank, but we think we can hear you okay. This is Marty.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research and Management","Great. Hey, Marty. So I had a question on your cash flow going forward basically it sounds like that you have indicated that basically in 2012, you Merchant business would cash flow positive, and I think you have mentioned that you\u2019re going to get the benefit of the money pool receivables there to kind of help you with that. So I\u2019m kind of curious as to what that number is that that\u2019s going to become from the Manipur receivables. But really more interested in 2013, when obviously you\u2019ve kind of given where the current strip is and where prices are today, that Merchant business will burning, I\u2019ll call it a $100 million plus of cash. So are you going to explicitly support that business going forward and you\u2019ll kind of bridge that shortfall or like what\u2019s the thinking in terms of actually helping with the casual situation post 2012.","Martin Lyons","Sure. So let me start with the 2012, so when we talked about the Merchant business overall being cash flow positive in 2012, I\u2019m talking about Ameren Energy Resources overall, which has Genco subsidiary as well as the eight AERG subsidy area assets and overall that would be cash flow positive. And then as you point out we said Genco which is a subsidiary of the Merchant Segment would utilize some of its Manipur receivables. As of yearend, it had about $74 million of Manipur receivables. And we project some more in the neighborhood of around half of that might be utilized this year by Genco.","As you look out in 2014 and beyond we certainly haven\u2019t given any cash flow guidance. We have said before and we\u2019ve repeated that and our goal is for the Merchant segment as well as for Genco to be able to support their cash flow needs. And we feel like the decisions we have made here with respect to decelerating the Newton Scrubber project and deferring the precipitator at Edwards are certainly very helpful to us in achieving that goal.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research and Management","Got it. So maybe then the question really is \u2013 I mean at the end of the day I am kind of running my own math and I am sure you guys have your own projections, but maybe the right question then to ask is assuming that the business is cash flow negative in 2013. Then how would you think about the Merchant business at that point in time, like you know just help us kind of think through the various options.","Martin Lyons","Well, I think in the various options first of all have to do with the segment and with the way the segment operates its business. So, we are certainly going to be looking for further opportunities to reduce operating expenses, to carefully and continually examine even the capital expenditures that we still have in the forecast and we\u2019re continuously seeking opportunities to market the power that we have at above market prices. So, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to be look into that segment to provide for its own needs And like I said I do think that these capital expenditure reductions that we\u2019ve made go a long way to helping that business cover its own cash needs over at least the next couple of years.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research and Management","Got it. Got it. And then what about my another question as in terms of coal to gas switching, Calpine last week obviously said that they were definitely seeing that in PJM, are you guys seeing something similar in MISO at this point?","Martin Lyons","No. I think within MISO at least within certainly our part of MISO gas prices being as low as they are we\u2019re seeing maybe a little bit of gas fire generation coming into the mix. Certainly as we look ahead ourselves to this coming year, we\u2019ve talked about having about 25 million megawatt hours that we\u2019re going to generate. I think our coal-fired plants are going to produce about 26.5 million megawatt hours and maybe 0.5 million megawatt hours coming from our gas assets, so we\u2019re expecting a little bit more contribution this year from our gas assets.","Overall though within MISO, in our part of MISO, the low cost delivered PRB coal is still pretty competitive with the gas assets that exist in our part of the country. So, certainly will \u2013 with these low gas prices, there will be more gas generation, but I think to a lesser extent than you may be seeing in other parts of the country.","Tom Rebinoff \u2013 Fore Research and Management","Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Paz with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David Paz \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on the parent level note, the $425 million note, are there any covenants in there that prevent you from divesting any of your segments particularly in your Merchant segment.","Martin Lyons","David, it\u2019s Marty. I am certainly not aware of any covenants in that indenture.","David Paz \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Great. And then on the Merchant power hedges and forgive me if you went through this earlier, I might have missed this, but just was trying to get a feel for the three to four terawatt hours that you added in your hedges in 2012 and 2013 as well as your 2014 hedges, particularly 2014, was the 7 terawatt hours at the average price of $44 entered into last year or are these part of like a multiyear contracts that predate post September 30, 2011.","Martin Lyons","Yeah. David, I think look we\u2019ve been entering into those over all those periods of time, so some of the contracts date back to probably pre 2012. I don\u2019t have the exact date, but other hedges that are embedded in that mix have been entered in 2010, 2011. We have been building that hedge block and that hedge piece up over time.","David Paz \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, can you give me a percentage [indiscernible].","Martin Lyons","No. I don\u2019t have it, I don\u2019t have a percentage breakdown.","David Paz \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And on the capacity-only hedges that just closed, I\u2019m sorry, did you say why that is not in the current presentation.","Martin Lyons","No, I didn\u2019t, but, yeah, you did notice change. Frankly, we took it out. I mean capacity revenues as you can see from the revenue breakdown at this point are unfortunately only about 1% of our overall revenue. So breaking that out didn\u2019t seem all that necessary at this point in time. Certainly as those capacity revenues improve over time. We certainly maybe break it out again. I mean I think it\u2019s safe David to be thinking about $15 million to $30 million of capacity only kind of revenues over the next couple of years given current prices. As you can see it from the pie chart, the majority of the capacity that we fell is embedded in some of our four requirements contact. So the capacity only sales like, I said about, $15 million to $30 million, is probably a safe number to put in your model.","David Paz \u2013 BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Senshak with Decade Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade Capital","Thank you. It\u2019s actually Reza Hatefi. Just I guess given your pretty solid CapEx program over the next few years, could you talk about need for trip or dribble or equity, how should we think about that over the next few years?","Martin Lyons","Good question. As you may you have picked up in our talking points, we \u2013 our stop in this year issuing shares for those programs, so you shouldn\u2019t expect to see any dilution from those program this year. However, moving forward in time, we will assess that on a year-to-year basis as we look at our cash flow needs to in particular finance the regulated CapEx plans that we have. I think that to the extent that we can support these capital expenditures through reinvestment of earnings that we make in our regulated business we\u2019ll certainly seek to do that, but also at all times thinking about maintaining sort of the financial strength that we have today.","Certainly, we\u2019d like to have the equity content and our cap structure somewhere between, I\u2019d say 50% to 53% equity range. And so our goals as we move through time are to keep that equity content solid in their balance sheet, keep our credit profile strong and stable and fund these capital expenditures in a prudent way. Hopefully, you can see through time we are trying to be very careful and thoughtful about our allocation to capital and the returns we\u2019re earnings on those capital investments.","Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade Capital","And just a follow-up on an earlier question, I guess the cash flow question on the Merchant segment, a lot of things can change going forward but is it in your tool box to use any cash from the corporate segment to fund any shortfalls at the Merchant segment, is that part of the potential equation?","Martin Lyons","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s in the toolbox. It\u2019s something that we could use to do. But as we\u2019ve said repeatedly our goal is for the Merchant segment and for Genco to work to provide for their own cash need. So that remains our focus.","Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade Capital","Great, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. Actually a couple of questions of the regulated side of the house. First, in the transmission spending guidance that you give five year look, how backend or frontend loaded is that, and if you could touch on both AIC and at ATX. And follow up to that, in Missouri you talked about trying to get a clause in this rate case that reduces lag on kind of plant being put in service. Do you need legislative relief to actually get that done? I thought there was an used and useful clause in state regulation in Missouri.","Martin Lyons","Michael, this is Marty again. I\u2019ll try to take both of those questions. With respect to the transmission spend what you really ought to see with respect to the Ameren Illinois utility spend with respect to transmission it\u2019s being more ratable over the five year period. So you see in the pie chart that we\u2019ve got $900 million of spend over the 2012 through 2016 period. And as we\u2019ve said in the call I think it\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of $180 million or so that we\u2019re spending this year so in 2012. So you should see kind of a stable run rate over that period of time.","With respect to the transmission company spend, however, that $750 million, that is more backend loaded. We\u2019re going to be working through the routing process, the siding, we\u2019re working on getting an ICC certificate in place and then moving forward and so that capital spending really starts to ramp up in 2014 and more so in 2015 and then 2016.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. The Missouri regulation legislated question.","Martin Lyons","Yeah. Your Missouri question. What we\u2019re proposing and I would say in this current rate case is, Michael somewhat similar to the accounting treatment that we got relative to scrubber investment that we had between the time that asset went to into service and the time we got into rates. You may recall that in that particular case we were allowed after it went into service to differ depreciation as well as caring cost on that asset from the time it went in service to the time rates became effective and what we are seeking here is something similar, but allowing us to have that kind of construction accounting on a broader basis with respect to plant put in service.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thanks guys and congrats on both a good quarter.","Martin Lyons","Thank you Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Reiss with Catapult. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Reiss \u2013 Catapult","Hi guys, my questions have actually been answered already thanks.","Martin Lyons","Okay Greg, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Howard with Prospector Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Howard \u2013 Prospector Partners","Hi, good morning. Wondering about just the latest decline in prices, is that kind of changed your hedging strategy at all for the Merchant business?","Martin Lyons","Yeah, Robert this is Marty. No, I wouldn\u2019t say it really is affecting our hedging practices. What we\u2019ve really tried to focus on over the past few years \u2013 several years is working to market our power to higher margin customers and when we hedge also looking at how we get the best location if you will to minimize basis risks. So we are still looking at putting on hedges as sales opportunities come along. We\u2019re still pursuing those and certainly focusing on the more higher margin opportunities that we get, but we are continuing to put hedges on. I\u2019d say for the past year or so we\u2019ve been putting the hedges on and operating to sort of the lower end of our hedge policy parameters, but sitting here today certainly feel happy that that we did that that we\u2019ve locked in some power prices in our hedge portfolio that are above current market prices.","Robert Howard \u2013 Prospector Partners","Yeah. Okay. And then I think it was kind of related to Julien\u2019s question earlier, slightly different though. Is there kind of a time limit that just delayed construction must be completed, I mean, if you don\u2019t have it done by 16 or 17, some rule kick in that okay the plant can\u2019t run or is there anything like that at all or can you just kind of delay indefinitely?","Tom Voss","You can\u2019t. This is Martin again. You can delay in definitely, but the Julien\u2019s question and hopefully I was responsive, but where you would start to see some reduction in terms of generation capability is out in the 2015 timeframe when the Illinois multi-pollutant standard has another ratchet down in terms of SO2 emission rates for the fleet. So out in that period, we absent other ways to comply might need to or would need to ratchet down to generation from our uncontrolled generating plants. Which plants would do that, how that might take place, that\u2019s all something that we have to asses and examined here over the coming months in terms of again absent the Newton scrubbers, how we would best go about complying.","Robert Howard \u2013 Prospector Partners","Okay. And that delay that \u2013 when you made the decision to delay, was that really driven by this latest decline in prices since your last call or was it kind of where you sort of on the track to come up to this decision anyways even with power prices being a little bit higher from like last fall\u2019s levels.","Tom Voss","Well, I would say that the power prices that we\u2019ve seen here in the first quarter to us don\u2019t look supportive of continuing with the investment at the space we were making at. So the prices did have a significant impact on the decision. But also the continued low capacity prices certainly about a capacity program within MISO. The other things though that also effected the decision where the stay of the CSAPR rules and the final match rule that came out as well as our decision last year to shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville. Those things \u2013 shut down of Meredosia and Hutsonville changed our emissions profile for a fleet, so that impacted our outlook. The stay of CSAPR affected our outlook, but again getting to your question, certainly the power prices were a very factor in the decision.","Robert Howard \u2013 Prospector Partners","There hasn\u2019t been, there\u2019s been enough other things going on that is power prices were to certainly jump to where they were in October. So is it necessarily enough for you to say hey we\u2019re going to put this back on schedule?","Martin Lyons","Right. So that\u2019s a good point. I think that look we\u2019re going to take the time that we\u2019ve bought through this deceleration to really access the power markets, capacity markets, change in environmental rules and like I said, but very closely at how we might alternatively comply with the rules that exist and make a reassessment at some point in the future.","Robert Howard \u2013 Prospector Partners","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Martin Lyons","You are welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Green Arrow. Please proceed with the question.","John Murphy \u2013 Green Arrow","","Hi guys, can you just give an update on what you\u2019re seeing in the Illinois\u2019 government aggregation market and what kind of opportunity that could be for you?","Martin Lyons","Yes, so that\u2019s \u2013 good you broke up a little bit for folks that maybe couldn\u2019t hear, I think the question was about municipal aggregation in Illinois and we do see that as an opportunity frankly for the Merchant business. We certainly as part for that business \u2013 we certainly have been very active as I said a little while ago offering our product to industrial customers, large commercial and municipal customers. And we certainly see this is an opportunity to some more generation to these aggregated municipal buyers through there are fee processes. So when you see there is an opportunity on the Merchant side of our business. And again we are very much focused on seeking opportunities to market and sell our power at prices that offer attractive margins about relative to say in the hub spot price.","John Murphy \u2013 Green Arrow","Great. Excellent.","Douglas Fischer","","This is Doug Fischer, operator we have time for just one more question.","Operator","","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Alex Tai with Standard General. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Martin Lyons","Good. Thank you.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","I just want to clarify a little bit on the timing of any decisions that\u2019s going to be made on the CapEx spend. You had previously said that 2015 is sort of the timeframe that you sort of have to \u2013 you have that something in place and you also said that it would take about 20 month to 24 months to complete that project, if you were to reaccelerate the new scrubbers. Just rough math, at least maybe 12 months with which to decide whether or not to resume the project, is that correct, am I sort of thinking about this the right way?","Martin Lyons","Yeah. That\u2019s right. I think, so as we will continue to asses I\u2019d say that the timeframe to if we were to reaccelerate, reaccelerate the project, what the exact timeframe would be. But like I said sitting here today we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s 20 month to 24 months, so I\u2019d say certainly sometime next year we\u2019ll be at a point in time where we\u2019ll be making some decision as it relates to compliance with those 2015 targets.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Got it. And in terms of the some of the other options you had mentioned activated carbon or \u2013 I don\u2019t specifically remember if you\u2019ve mentioned this, but dry sorbent injections, what\u2019s the lead time for converting to an alternative system for environmental combines.","Martin Lyons","I think one thing about Illinois as it relates to Mercury is we\u2019re already are using a lot of activated carbon for compliance there already, so you know that sort of underway. In terms of DSI, I can\u2019t really, sitting here today, give you a timeline on what it would take to put that in place. I think that is probably a shorter timeframe than the one we\u2019re talking about in terms of the scrubber project.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Got it and so I guess to get a little bit more clarification, if you decide to not resume the scrubber, what, I mean, can you sort of just layout I guess a roadmap of what the other options look like?","Martin Lyons","Not at this time. I think it\u2019s really too soon and premature to say. I think that we\u2019ll asses all alternatives we have with respect to compliance and look we\u2019re talking about 2015 and certainly a lot can change in terms of forward power prices and capacity prices. And so we\u2019ll be assessing all of those compliance options at the same time as we\u2019re really watching how the power markets and environmental standards unfold.","Alex Tai \u2013 Standard General","Okay. All right.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Fischer. You may begin.","Doug Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com website homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.","As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-looking Statements section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC. Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today\u2019s presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now, here\u2019s Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our coworkers who volunteered to leave their families work weeks to support Puerto Rico in this hurricane restoration efforts as well as offer best wishes to a second group of coworkers who are heading to the island to continue this important work. It\u2019s been a historic year for restoration efforts following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which impacted so many in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. I\u2019m so proud of all of our coworkers who volunteered to support this important restoration efforts as well as those who stayed behind and handled extra duties while they were gone. These efforts displayed incredible teamwork and commitment to our mission to power the quality of life.","Now moving to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced 2017 core earnings of $2.83 per share compared to $2.68 per share earned in 2016. This marks another year of strong growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy across our businesses. While Marty will discuss the drivers of these results in a few minutes, I\u2019d like to highlight some areas of our team\u2019s strong performance in 2017.","Last year, we continue to exercise discipline, cost management and strategically allocated capital to our businesses that were supported by constructive regulatory frameworks. We also effectively managed capital projects across all of our businesses, which ultimately delivered value to our customers. ATXI\u2019s three major transmission projects proceeded very well, as noted on this page. We continue to make significant good modernization investments in our Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses, including the continued deployment of smart electric meters and gas modules, which combined, are now about two-thirds complete.","In addition, Callaway safely concluded its major refueling and maintenance outage in December. Another key 2017 accomplishment was the constructive outcome achieved by Ameren Missouri in its electric rate review. As a result, new electric rates will need to effect in April, heavily impacting our results and supporting Ameren Missouri\u2019s efforts to earn a fair return on the electric utility infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers. Further, last fall, Ameren Missouri filed a new Integrated Resource Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which meaningfully advances the transition of our power generation to a cleaner, more diverse energy portfolio.","And finally, working together with many of our nation\u2019s investor-owned utilities, we successfully advocated for key income tax provisions in the recently enacted federal income tax reform law that would change important tax benefits for both customers and shareholders. As you can see, we successfully executed our strategy in 2017, which delivered significant value for our customers and shareholders.","Turning now to Page 5, in earnings guidance. First, we expect our 2018 earnings per share to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.15 per share. Earnings within this range will deliver strong growth again in 2018. As the midpoint, this guidance represents nearly 8% earnings per share growth compared to 2017 core results. Marty will provide you with more details on our 2018 guidance a bit later.","Building on a robust earnings growth over the past several years, I am also pleased to announce that we have rolled forward our long-term guidance, and we expect strong 5% to 7% compound annual earnings growth for the 2017 through 2022 period, using 2017 core earnings as a base. This long-term earnings growth outlook is driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of customers. And, as I would discuss further in a moment, this guidance does not reflect significant incremental infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri.","Turning to Page 6. We expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 7% compound annual rate over 2017 through 2022 period. Our plan again includes strategically allocating capital to those businesses that operate in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. This is reflected in the expected rate base growth for each of these businesses as noted in the graph on the right side of this page. I would also note that lowered deferred tax balances related to federal tax reform is driving faster rate base growth in each of our jurisdictions.","For example, Missouri\u2019s rate base growth would\u2019ve been in the range of 2% to 2.5%, not for the positive impacts of federal tax reform on rate base. Marty will discuss tax reform impacts in greater detail later in the call. Importantly, our five year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include the incremental investment opportunity of approximately $1 billion of wind generation by 2020, proposed in Ameren Missouri\u2019s Integrated Resource Plan that I discussed earlier. We expect to add these investments to our multiyear rate base outlook as we finalize pending negotiations with wind developers and move further into the regulatory approval process in Missouri, which I will cover in a few moments.","In addition, a five year earnings and rate base growth plan does not include approximately $1 billion of potential incremental capital expenditures for 2023, that we would expect to execute if legislation is enacted to support grid modernization and infrastructure investment.","Speaking of this important legislation, I now direct you to Page 7 of the presentation. As you know, for several years, we, along with our investor-owned electric industry colleagues in Missouri, have been focused on enhancing the state\u2019s regulatory framework to support critical energy infrastructure investment. Consistent with the benefits we\u2019ve seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers energy needs and rising expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri.","With these benefits in mind, I am pleased to report that the Senate passed Senate Bill 564 yesterday by a strong bipartisan vote. In the passage of this bill is a result of hard work, collaboration and compromise by many parties. The Bill now head to the House of Representatives. Key provisions of Senate Bill 564 for electric utility service are outlined on this page. If enacted, as currently written, this legislation will support our ability to invest an incremental $1 billion in infrastructure through 2023 that would drive significant long-term benefits to customers, and create good paying jobs as well as earn fair returns on those investments.","The legislation will also benefit customers that provide in the Missouri Public Service Commission onetime authority to pass on savings stemming from the lower federal corporate income tax rate in a very timely fashion. The legislation also provide economic development raise for certain incremental electric sales. Further, one of the most significant customer benefits is the rates certainty this legislation will provide. Base rates would be frozen through March 31, 2020. The average overall rate increases will be capped at 2.85% compounded annually to 2023. The provisions of Senate Bill 564 can be extended through 2028 if requested by the Electric Utility and approved by the Missouri PSC. Finally, this bill would maintain continued strong Missouri PSC oversight. The legislative session ends on May 2018.","Moving now to Page 8 for an update on our wind generation investment plans that I referenced earlier. We\u2019re in advanced negotiations with multiple wind developers for the development, construction and purchase of at least 700 megawatts of generation to achieve compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. Upon reaching agreements with wind developers, we will file requests for certificates of convenience and necessity for each project with the Missouri PSC, which we expect will be made in the first half of 2018. We plan to include in our certificate filings request for authorization to use Missouri\u2019s Renewable Energy Standard rate adjustment mechanism. This mechanism provides timely rate recovery of renewable energy costs related to the compliance with the State\u2019s Renewable Energy Standard.","And finally, Regional Transmission Organization interconnection studies are already underway for these projects. We look forward to executing this important component of the Integrated Resource Plan because we believe it will deliver clear benefits to our customers, the environment and the communities we serve.","Turning now to Page 9. As we look to the future, successful execution of our five year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results for 2022, it\u2019s also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that the energy grid will be increasingly important as we expect Ameren and our industry to be critical enablers of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers\u2019 future energy needs and rising expectations. This will also put increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes.","In addition to focusing on investment in the energy grid, we are also committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri\u2019s generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Ameren Missouri\u2019s IRP issued last September, included targets for reducing carbon emissions, included an 80% reduction by 2050 from 2005 levels. We\u2019re also actively engaged in and continue to support regulatory proceedings in both Illinois and Missouri that are looking at emerging industry issues, including grid modernization and increasing electrification. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across-the-board to position Ameren for success in 2018, the next five years, the next decade and beyond.","Moving to Page 10. I am firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2018 and beyond would deliver superior value to our customers and our shareholders. We believe that earnings and rate base growth rates I just discussed compare favorably with those by our regulated utility peers. And, as I noted previously, these estimates do not include significant incremental investment opportunities in wind generation and energy grid monetization.","Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. And in the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren\u2019s Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, escrows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings outlook, combined with our solid dividend, which currently provides a yield of approximately 3.3%, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers.","Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?","Martin Lyons","Thanks, Warner, and good morning everyone. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2017 GAAP earnings of $2.14 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $2.68 per share for the prior year. As you can see in the table on this page, the 2017 GAAP earnings included two noncash charges, primarily at the parent company, that decreased earnings by a combined $168 million or $0.69 per diluted share, reflecting the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of changes in Illinois and federal income tax rates. Excluding these charges, Ameren recorded 2017 core earnings of $691 million or $2.83 per diluted share, which compared favorably to our last guidance range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share. There were no differences between GAAP and core earnings for 2016.","Turning to Page 13. We highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.15 per share increase in 2017 core earnings compared to 2016 results. Starting with Ameren Transmission, here, the earnings per share contribution increased $0.10 per share from $0.48 in 2016 to $0.58 in 2017. This 21% growth was primarily driven by earnings on increased infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity of 10.82% for 2017 compared to an average of approximately 11.3% for the prior year. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE that extended from mid-May to late September 2016 when the FERC adjusted MISOs based ROE to its current level.","Turning to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Earnings for this segment grew from $0.52 per share in 2016 to $0.54 per share in 2017, reflecting increasing infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 8.7% compared to 8.4% for the prior year. The 2017 allowed ROE was based on a 2017 average 30- year Treasury yield of 2.9%, up from the 2016 average of 2.6%.","Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution earnings were up slightly due to infrastructure investment. Moving to Ameren Missouri, our largest segment. Here, earnings increased from $1.47 per share in 2016 to $1.48 per share in 2017. The earnings benefit from new electric service rates was largely offset by the unfavorable impacts of lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures, higher depreciation and transmission expenses and the absence of the 2016 performance incentive award related to the 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan.","Finally, the Ameren parent and other results comparison was positively impacted by a lower core effective income tax rate, which was largely offset by lower tax benefits associated with share- based compensation.","Before moving, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for 2017 compared to 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt- hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the 2016 leap day sales benefit and the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under MEEIA. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased 1.5%, excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016 and excluding leap day and MEEIA effects.","Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency, while kilowatt-hour sales to sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 3%, due to lower sales to a large low- margin processor of agricultural products. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning in 2017.","Turning now to Page 14. Before I discuss our new five-year capital investment plans and 2018 earnings and cash flow outlook, I would like to discuss the impacts of federal income tax reform. Working together with many of our nation\u2019s investor-owned utilities, we were able to retain important tax benefits for both customers and shareholders as outlined on the top portion of this page. In terms of impacts for Ameren, as noted at the bottom of the page, we expect that the combination of the lower tax rate on new deferred taxes, the end-of-bonus depreciation and the flowback of excess deferred taxes will decrease cash flow from operations and increase rate base by approximately $1 billion over the 2018 through 2022 period. In addition, we expect our parent company interest expense to be deductible. However, the lower federal rate reduced the tax benefits associated with parent company and other unrecoverable costs.","Finally, the change in the federal tax rate resulted in a noncash, non-core charge to 2017 earnings that I discussed earlier. Overall, federal corporate income tax reform delivers significant benefits to customers and supports our strong earnings growth outlook, as Warner mentioned.","Moving to Page 15 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our approximately $11 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2018 through 2022 period by business segment that supports the rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. Note, the capital expenditures and rate base shown on this page exclude Ameren Missouri\u2019s proposed wind generation and incremental grid modernization investments related to pending Missouri legislation.","Turning to Page 16. Here, we outlined the expected funding sources, including significant income tax deferrals and substantial tax assets, for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers, which was retained in the new federal tax law. The tax assets include approximately $250 million at the parent company that are not currently earning a return.","Given our expected cash flows from operations, including the cash flow impact of tax reform that I just discussed, as well as our capital expenditures and other cash requirements, we are now using newly issued, rather than market-purchased, shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, and we expect to continue to do so over the five year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $80 million annually. This action will enable us to maintain strong credit metrics and a capitalization target of approximately 50% equity.","Moving to Page 17 of our presentation. I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2018 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2018 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.15 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2018 earnings guidance, broken down by segment as compared to 2017 results. The difference between current EPS variances noted and comparable variances provided to you on our 2017 quarterly earnings calls reflect the change in the federal income tax rate.","Beginning with Ameren Transmission, earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC\u2019s formula ratemaking. Our guidance assumes continuation of the current 10.82% allowed ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder from MISO membership. The second MISO ROE complaint case remains pending at the FERC, and we don\u2019t know when the case will be decided. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking.","Our guidance incorporates a formula-based allowed ROE of 8.9% using a forecasted 3.1% 2018 average yield for the 30- year Treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.7% in 2017. Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state\u2019s gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROEs for the Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segments on this page.","Turning to Page 18. Our Ameren Missouri earnings are expected to rise in 2018. Earnings are expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1, 2017. In addition, there is no scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center this year since these outages are on an 18-month cycle. The absence of these expenses is expected to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2017.","The next Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is scheduled for the spring of 2019. Further, a return-to-normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017, and we expect lower interest expense driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers, we expect higher other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily the result of higher-than-normal scheduled nonnuclear plant outages. In addition, we expect Ameren Missouri\u2019s 2018 results to reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation expenses.","Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 22% this year, a decrease from last year\u2019s core tax rate of 37%, reflecting the substantially lower federal corporate rate and flowback of excess deferred taxes. I would note that our 2018 guidance excludes any possible temporary retention of cash flow or earnings benefits from this lower federal tax rate. The benefits of lower tax rates will be reflected in Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution service rate reviews as of the beginning of the year as a result of formula ratemaking. While the timing of reflecting these benefits in our Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Ameren Missouri customer rate reviews has not been determined, we do expect customer rates to be adjusted in 2018 for the lower federal tax rate. Further, we expect the comparison of earnings to last year to be unfavorably impacted by $0.03 per share for the reduced tax benefit associated with parent company and other unrecoverable costs.","Finally, we expect the use of newly issued shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.01 per share. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2018 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers as well as to our industrial customers to be flat to up slightly compared to last year, excluding the effects of our MEEIA energy efficiency programs.","Turning to Illinois, we expect our weather- normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers in that state to be roughly flat and sales to industrial customers to decline about 2% this year compared to last. Again, I would remind you that changes in electric sales in Illinois do not impact our earnings due to revenue decoupling.","Turning then to Page 19. For 2018, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $900 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2018 capital expenditures by business. We expect to fund this year\u2019s negative free cash flow and debt maturities primarily through a combination of short-and long-term debt issuances and borrowings as well as the previously mentioned issuance of common shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans.","Moving now to Page 20 for a discussion of select regulatory matters. For Ameren Transmission, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce they base-allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners remains pending at the FERC as previously mentioned. We expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling in the New England ROE case as well as the MISO transmission owners\u2019 recent motion to dismiss the second MISO ROE complaint case as both may influence the FERC.","Moving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. In December, the ICC approved a rate change consistent with our filing in the annual rate update proceeding with new rates effective at the beginning of this year. This outcome is assigned that Illinois formula electric distribution ratemaking continues to work as intended.","Moving to Page 21 and Ameren Natural Gas regulatory matters. Last month, we filed a request for a $49 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2019 future test year with the ICC. This $49 million includes an estimated $42 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2019 under Ameren Illinois qualifying infrastructure plant, or QIP, rider. Particulars of this gas rate case filing are noted on this page. An ICC decision is required by December of 2018 with new rates expected to be effective in January 2019.","Turning to Missouri regulatory matters. Earlier this week, the commission staff issued its report recommending the Missouri PSE open a proceeding for each utility to pursue rate reductions to pass savings from the lower federal income tax rate on to customers. Of course, if Senate Bill 564 is enacted, as currently written, Ameren Missouri would pass savings from the lower federal income tax rate on to electric customers in a timely fashion, pursuant to its provisions.","Finally, turning to Page 22, I will summarize. We delivered strong core earnings growth in 2017 and expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2018 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares favorably to our peers.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning. Congratulations.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Julien. How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Thank you. So I wanted to first ask real quickly on the legislation and the previously contemplated $1 billion program. How much inflation in bills does that $1 billion contemplate? How much latitude does that give you when you kind of hash that out against the tax reform, et cetera, against these new rates that they\u2019re putting in there?","Michael Moehn","Julien, this is Michael Moehn. I don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t really said. I mean, what we\u2019ve been clear about is that we think as this legislation is written, 564, it certainly would support that incremental $1 billion of investment, and we think that we could do it underneath that prescribed cap.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then clearly, there\u2019s a multitude of factors that would drive your financing needs higher to your tax reform and incremental spend, if successful, on either front, how are you thinking about your debt commitments? Clearly, I hear you saying you\u2019re committed to your existing strong credit metrics, but how committed? Perhaps can you elaborate a little bit on the equity financing needs if you get either of the two incremental projects?","Martin Lyons","Julien, this is Marty. Yes. When you look at the credit metrics and the credit ratings that we have today, we are very happy with the credit ratings that we have today. Our issue of ratings today for Ameren at S&P are BBB+, as shown in the materials; and with Moody\u2019s, Baa1. To give you a sense, I mean, our FFO-to-debt metric, the threshold that S&P has for us out there, that BBB+, is 13%. And at Moody\u2019s, the threshold for the Baa1 for FFO to debt is 20%. So look, as we go through time, and you can see this in the materials we provided today, we\u2019ve always looked to maintain a strong balance sheet, strong credit metrics.","We\u2019ve worked hard over the past several years to improve, I\u2019d say, the business risk profile of the company, and we\u2019re going to continue to work on both of those fronts as we move forward. As we looked at the capital investment plan that we laid out today, the rate base growth plans and we looked at our cash flows, including the impacts of tax reform, we ended up thinking it was certainly prudent that we go ahead and issue some equity under the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit programs, again with the goal of keeping the balance sheet strong and keeping strong credit metrics.","As we look ahead and as we update the capital expenditure plans, looking ahead the rate base growth plans, we\u2019ll step back and assess the overall capital plan and the funding needs but again with that backdrop of wanting to keep a balance sheet, strong credit metrics, and importantly, make sure we\u2019re positioning those investments for success in the regulatory environment as we seek to earn a fair equity returns on those investments.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","just a further nuance on this, if you can. What\u2019s the timing of the commencement expense, specifically, and the legislation is contemplated? When could you actually start spending? And over what period of time, at present, do you intent to spend that $1 billion under your earlier program or proposal?","Warner Baxter","Julien, this is Warner. I think what we said is we would spend these expenditures through 2023. That\u2019s what it would be. And a lot of this would be predicated when the legislation is ultimately passed, but we\u2019ve been clear. We had a plan out there. That\u2019s a five-year plan for $1 billion. And so through 2023 is what we\u2019ve been talking about.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And so fairly ratable.","Warner Baxter","I\u2019m sorry?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Fairly ratable.","Warner Baxter","Yes, yes. Relatively speaking, I think fairly ratable is a good way to think about it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","That all. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Sure. Thank you Julien.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning and congratulations on everything.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Paul. How are you doing?","Paul Patterson","I\u2019m doing great. Just with respect to the 3.5% rate base growth in your slides for Missouri, does that include pretty much what you see happening in \u2013 this long-term rate base growth, does that include the legislative impact?","Martin Lyons","Paul, this is Marty. No, it does not. So when you look at that slide, it includes the $4.3 billion of expenditures that are shown in the table to the left. And then as Warner pointed out on the conference call, it includes the impacts of tax reform and the impacts on rate base we see from, I\u2019d say, the changes in deferred taxes versus what we otherwise would have expected.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So to Julien\u2019s point, I guess, there\u2019s additional upside that we could see in this? Is that a good way to think about it?","Martin Lyons","Yes. Yes.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then when we look at this 7% growth rate and we look at your previous credit rate and rate base and what have you, I know that you guys have a higher base and what have you, but the lower sales growth \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the lower earnings \u2013 long-term earnings growth on the top end of the range you\u2019ve lowered it a little bit. Is that just simply a function of the change? And could you just walk through that a little bit compared to now that you\u2019ve got a higher growth in rate base? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s not completely intuitive maybe why the top end of the earnings growth rate has gone down.","Martin Lyons","Yes. Well, look, I think we have a very strong rate base growth plan at 7%. And I think our EPS growth that goes along with it, a 5% to 7% compound annual, is also very strong, especially coming off of the strong 2017 earning base that we have of $2.83. So that is the base for that. And I would say that, Paul, as you think about it, it includes also all of our assumptions about funding that I just laid out, including the use of equity from those dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plan. Again, that should produce about $80 million of equity annually. And I think the 5% to 7%, which is, again, we think very strong, incorporates a variety of assumptions in terms of Treasury rate assumptions, spending levels, rate case outcomes, economic conditions and the like. But it does \u2013 it\u2019s what we believe is certainly the right growth given the rate base and funding plans that we\u2019ve laid out.","Paul Patterson","Okay, fine. And this is \u2013 there was some discussion yesterday at the Missouri PSE among the commissioners regarding another utility, and it looks like a majority of them don\u2019t \u2013 or basically are not necessarily supportive of a consolidated cap structure. And I\u2019m just wondering, now you guys made comments about your commitment to obviously the credit ratings and what have you. But just in general, I\u2019m just wondering is there any perhaps \u2013 have you guys been thinking perhaps that there could be additional sort of opportunity on double leverage or anything like that? ","Martin Lyons","Paul, I think if you look through time, I mean, we\u2019ve always worked to maintain strong balance sheets and credit metrics at all of our legal entities, both the parent company as well as our subsidiaries. We laid out on the slides that our target capitalization over time is around 50-50. And I would say, as it relates to Ameren Missouri, for a third time, we have had ratemaking in Missouri for our Ameren Missouri utility that is based on the utility\u2019s capital structure. And we would expect that to be the case through time.","Paul Patterson","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman","So just when you first talked about doing the wind projects, you suggested then that we could see some modification of the base plan as part of it. At this point now, should we assume this is the base plan? And then if you do the wind and if you do the \u2013 if the legislation passes, those are just additive, not likely to be any meaningful adjustment to this base?","Warner Baxter ","Steven, this is Warner. I think clearly we\u2019d pointed out opportunities for additions, both for the wind as well as for grid modernization. We presented our base plan, and we have two meaningful opportunities that we\u2019ll continue to work very hard to execute on. And so it\u2019d be premature to say exactly what we\u2019ll do with the overall plan. But the bottom line, we\u2019re not saying we\u2019re going to make any changes to the plan as we see it today.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just on the wind projects, could you just be a little more explicit on how the CCN process works? So you\u2019ll file \u2013 once we have winners, you\u2019ll file CCN. The renewable rider is kind of part of that filing, so kind of both the project and the rate treatment would all be approved in one proceeding.","Michael Moehn","Yes. Steve, this is Michael Moehn. Yes, you got it right. And so I think what we have been telling folks as we wrap up the conclusion of these contracts that we\u2019ll be filing for the CCN in the first half of 2018. And you\u2019re correct, I mean, as part of that filing, we would make the request to use what\u2019s called the RESRAM, the regulatory recovery mechanism for these renewable projects. And that process, I think, we\u2019ve been saying could take anywhere from six to 10 months to complete.","Steve Fleishman","Good. I think that\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Michael Moehn","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Levi","Hi guys. Andrew Levi ","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Andy. How are you?","Andrew Levi","It\u2019s Andrew Levi. Just one or maybe two questions. But on the $0.14 of Missouri incremental O&M relating to plants, can you just kind of go more into that of exactly what\u2019s going on there because that was not part of your EEI disclosures and where that came from and whether that goes away in 2019?","Martin Lyons","Andy, this is Marty. Yes. When you look at it overall, especially in a non-Callaway outage year, we thought it was certainly prudent this particular year to have a little bit of a higher or higher-than-normal schedule for our nonnuclear outage costs. And that\u2019s the primary driver of that number as well as some \u2013 I\u2019d just say some other O&M that we have in Missouri this year. I would not necessarily expect that to be a recurring number year-over-year. And look, I think when you step back overall, as you know, we\u2019ve been improving our earn return as a company and each of our jurisdictions through time on a consolidated basis. And in Missouri, it\u2019s our goal to continue to earn very close to our allowed returns.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So out of the $0.14, how much is kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say onetime in nature, but was put there because of the Callaway \u2013 back at the Callaway outage?","Martin Lyons","I guess I don\u2019t have a breakdown on exactly that number for you, Andy, other than to say I wouldn\u2019t call them necessarily onetime. These kinds of outages do occur through time, just a higher concentration of them this year than in some other years.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Got that. And then on the 2.85% increase that\u2019s capped in Missouri? Does that include fuel or not?","Martin Lyons","That\u2019s an all-in cap, Andy","Andrew Levi","So that does include fuel. So if fuel would go up, that would be part of the 2.85% cap?","Martin Lyons","That\u2019s correct.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And on the wind project, is that part \u2013 is that something to the cap as well?","Martin Lyons","It is. Yes, it is.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Martin Lyons","Thank you Andy. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","Good morning. Congratulations.","Warner Baxter","Hi, Ashar. How are you?","Ashar Khan","Could you just describe the timing of the wind RFP, you said, kind of approvals by the first half of this year? Could you just tell us how we should look at that \u2013 the timing of some kind of an announcement as we look in the next, two, four months?","Warner Baxter","Michael, you want to address that, please?","Michael Moehn","Yes. Again, as we\u2019ve talked a couple of times, we have been going through this RFP process and now are in the middle of serious contract negotiations, which we hope to be wrapping up soon. And we just were committed to filing the CCN in the first half of 2018.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then once you file it, how should \u2013 what approval time frame should we look at?","Michael Moehn","The CCN process, we\u2019ve been saying that it typically follows about a six- to 10-month kind of approval process.","Ashar Khan","Six months to 10 months. Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Just because there\u2019s been so much focus on the Senate and clearly you\u2019ve cleared that hurdle, but can you give a sense of the tone in the House?","Warner Baxter","Yes. Paul, this is Warner, and I\u2019ll ask Michael to comment. Look, I think that the bottom line is, as we\u2019ve said, the passage of this bill in the Senate is a positive step forward, but now we\u2019re going to turn our attention to the House of Representatives. And what we do is we\u2019re going to look forward to discussing the real significant benefits of Senate Bill 564 with all the members of the House. You have to keep in mind that the Senate just passed this bill so that it\u2019s now moved on over to the House, and so we\u2019re looking forward to having those conversations.","Michael Moehn","I Yes. I would just add, look, this bill is the result of a lot hard work and compromise. I mean, it\u2019s an excellent bill. I think that, as Warner said, we\u2019re going to demonstrate the benefits to our customers, so obviously the benefits to us and benefits to the state of Missouri. So we look forward to engaging with the House.","Warner Baxter","And, Michael, just to add a little bit to that and I guess a little maybe to what Steve\u2019s question was before. When we look at this bill, and we\u2019ve been clear that if Senate Bill 564 is passed, I mean, we will spend significantly more investments or make significantly more investment in the state of Missouri. $1 billion, this is what we\u2019re talking about. And so that is absolutely our plan. And so with that comes significant benefits to our customers in terms of, not just modernizing the grid, but also giving them the tools that they want to manage our energy usage. Michael talked about this compromise. This compromise took what was already a bill that have robust consumer protection and made them even more robust. So these are the types of things that we\u2019re going to talk about the with House of Representatives, including a significant number of jobs that will be driven by this bill.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you. That\u2019s good color.","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Kalton","Hi, guys, how are you?","Warner Baxter","Good morning Neil, how are you?","Neil Kalton","Good, thanks. Just a question on wind in Missouri. I think Empire sequenced maybe a little bit before you guys. Is that proposal a good proxy for your project? Or would you advise us not to sort of look too closely to that, that the proposals between you and Empire are unique?","Michael Moehn","Which assets, Neil, are you referring to? I mean, in terms of their\u2026","Neil Kalton","What I\u2019m getting to is simply depending on how that process goes, is that \u2013 if there\u2019s something that\u2019s negative that kind of comes out, would that be a good readthrough to your proposal? Or would you advise us that your proposal is unique versus the Empire proposal? ","Michael Moehn","Yes. I think, our proposal, yes. Again, if you just step back and you think about why we\u2019re doing this, I mean, you have the renewable standard that\u2019s out there that requires us to have the renewables in place by 2021. I mean, that\u2019s really the driver behind this. We went through a robust RFP process, which we\u2019re in the process of bringing to a conclusion. We\u2019re working through all the transmission issues that come along with that, and then we\u2019re going to file the CCN. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s the process that I think you typically file with the commission here in the state of Missouri. So I think we feel very, very good about our overall process. I can\u2019t really comment about Empire\u2019s but feel strong about ours.","Neil Kalton","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a follow-up on the capital plan. So \u2013 and I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces here, but if some of the incremental spend comes through in Missouri, should we think of the base plan as being the base plan? And then everything else would be additive? Or could the base plan be somewhat fluid and there might be some capital there that would be sequenced that way?","Martin Lyons","Yes. Neil, this is Marty again. As we\u2019ve said before, to the extent we have additional capital expenditures, and in this case, whether they\u2019d be related to the wind, whether they\u2019d be related to the Senate Bill 564, we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ll stop \u2013 step back and we\u2019ll reassess the overall capital plan and funding plans. But as Warner said, it\u2019s premature to discuss whether we would make any changes to the base plan that we have today. We have said repeatedly that we are certain that if we get Senate Bill 564 across the finish line that we will put significantly more capital to work in the state of Missouri. And so I\u2019d say that those are sort of our thoughts as we look ahead and think about the possibility of those incremental expenditures.","Warner Baxter","Well said, Marty. And I would just add similarly with wind, right. That\u2019s the bottom line. We have a very constructive regulatory mechanism that is contained and then the renewable energy standard. Both of those things will drive important than investments in the state of Missouri.","Neil Kalton","That makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Levi","It\u2019s me again. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I mean, this is just me because I\u2019m reading Slide 7, where you described the legislation and but still having read parts of the legislation, why would the wind be subject to the cap? It\u2019s not part of the infrastructure spending.","Warner Baxter","So Andy, I\u2019m sorry, if you don\u2019t mind, could you maybe repeat your question? It\u2019s a little bit loud \u2013 it\u2019s hard to hear you.","Andrew Levi","I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to take the headset off, so \u2013 battery is going down. Okay. So if you look on Page 7 of your slide deck, and obviously you\u2019ve \u2013 I mean, obviously you know the legislation better than I do. But my understanding was, based on your slide and reading parts of the legislation, that your wind investment would be not \u2013 would not be subject to the cap. Am I wrong on that or\u2026","Michael Moehn","So the wind does fall underneath the cap. I think what the slide is potentially trying to explain is that if these riders cause you to exceed the cap, either the FAC, the RESRAM, et cetera, you\u2019re able to defer that for a future rate case as long as you\u2019re, again, underneath that 2.85% and get that recovered.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So it\u2019s like in FRP like it is in Arkansas where it\u2019s capped to a certain amount, but then you defer it and you recover it in the next rate case. If the rate case or rate case or true-up, so let\u2019s just say, I don\u2019t know, like in 2019, you max out at 2.85, but there\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just say, another $50 million left over. But in 2020 you\u2019re at 1%, that $50 million would be on \u2013 would be added to the 2020 number, so the 1% plus that $50 million. Is that kind of what you\u2019re saying?","Warner Baxter","Yes. That\u2019s great. That clarifies much better. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Doug Fischer for any closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating on this call. Let me remind you again.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of first quarter results and an update on financial and regulatory matters. We will then open the call for questions. Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a continuing operations and diluted share basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner L. Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced first quarter 2015 earnings of $0.45 per share compared with $0.40 per share in last year's first quarter. This earnings advance reflected increased electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois and the formula ratemaking for the benefit of customers.","Our first quarter results also benefited from reduced parent company interest charges. However, the earnings contributions from these factors were somewhat reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs for the FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery areas of our business. Earnings were also reduced by lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, due primarily to milder winter temperatures and energy efficiency. Our solid first quarter results clearly reflect the benefits of strategically allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. These solid first quarter results also provide a good foundation for achieving our full year earnings expectations. Therefore, today, we affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance, which is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Marty will discuss first quarter earnings in more detail in a few minutes, including comments on additional factors contributing to the higher results.","Turning to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy, which we strongly believe will deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses where investment is supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery, as well as long-term benefits to our customers.","In particular, we invested approximately $270 million during the first quarter on FERC-regulated electric transmission projects and Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure. Work on the $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project is advancing as planned. Line construction is expected to begin on the first line segment this month, with completion planned for next year. And we have begun foundation construction on the second line segment. Further, Ameren Illinois' modernization action plan is on track to meet its reliability, advanced metering and job creation goals for this year related to the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. Also, Ameren remains actively engaged in advocating for responsible energy policies.","In Illinois, policymakers continue to be forward-thinking in implementing constructive frameworks to support modernization of the state's aging energy infrastructure. In particular, I am very pleased to know that legislation extending constructive electric formula ratemaking through 2019 was passed by a wide margin in the General Assembly is now law. This enables Ameren Illinois' modernization of the electric grid to continue with the regulatory and financial certainty needed to replace aging infrastructure, make investments in new technology, upgrade equipment, hire and train new Illinois coworkers, all in an effort to deliver higher-quality service to our customers. Further, the extension of constructive formula ratemaking was cited by Moody's and Fitch in their recent reports upgrading certain of Ameren Illinois' credit ratings. I believe these actions reinforce that good energy policy leads to benefits for customers and investors.","On the federal level, we continue to collaborate with industry leaders, stakeholders and policymakers across the country to aggressively advocate for constructive and responsible improvements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan. Simply put, we have serious concerns with the EPA's current proposed rules. Aside from the legal challenges that the Clean Power Plan will face in the future, we believe that many of the underlying assumptions that are the foundation of these proposed rules were unreasonable. Most important, we, along with experts across the country, have stated that implementation of these rules in their current form will meaningfully raise reliability risks for the grid, and electricity costs for our customers are projected to rise significantly under the current proposed rules.","While we have serious concerns with these rules, we are not just saying no. Instead, we have proposed several commonsense solutions, including eliminating unrealistic interim targets and allowing the states to determine the best path to address the EPA's final targets. Also, we are strongly advocating that the rules include protections to ensure that our nation's grid is able to operate in a reliable fashion. Our plan will materially reduce greenhouse gas emissions while saving customers billions of dollars and preserving the reliable service U.S. citizens have enjoyed for decades. In summary, we believe our constructive alternative is the right thing for our customers, our country and the environment.","Our clean energy plan also includes continued reliance on dependable and carbon-free nuclear generation from the Callaway Energy Center. Recently, we achieved a major milestone in this regard. In March, we obtained Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for extending the operating license for Callaway by 20 years to 2044. In addition to prudently investing in our utilities and advocating for responsible energy policies, we remain relentlessly focused on achieving operational improvements and efficiencies across all of our businesses, including the continuation of our lean management efforts throughout our organization. We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and aligning our overall spending with regulatory frameworks and outcome as well as economic conditions. And we remain committed to our goal of closing gaps between earned and allowed returns on equity.","Turning now to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on some other legislative and regulatory matters related to our businesses. Beginning with Missouri, that state's Public Service Commission approved a $122 million increase in Ameren Missouri's electric service rates in a decision issued last week. As you know, the primary drivers of this rate case were significant investments made over the past couple of years to improve the quality of service we provide to our customers in terms of safety, reliability and environmental stewardship, as well as accelerated recovery of our aging Meramec Energy Center investment and rising net energy costs for our energy centers.","While we are pleased that the Public Service Commission's order allows for the recovery of these important infrastructure investments and increased net energy costs, other aspects of the decision are disappointing. This includes the 9.53% allowed ROE, which is a decrease from the current allowed ROE of 9.8% authorized back in December 2012. In addition, the Public Service Commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses with a fuel adjustment clause and discontinued tracking mechanisms for vegetation management and storm cost recovery. Lastly, the commission is revenue neutral to Ameren Missouri and will be subsidized by our other customers. We have consistently stated that this is an economic development matter which should have been addressed by the Missouri legislature. Marty will provide further details on this rate order in a few minutes.","While we are disappointed with the commission's decision, we are already moving forward with action plans to address the outcome of this rate case. We will request a rehearing on several aspects of this order, including the allowed ROE and the elimination of recovery of changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. As we have done in the past, we will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this regulatory outcome while maintaining our goal of earning at or very close to our new allowed ROE. And finally, we will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of modernizing the regulatory framework in Missouri in order to support investment to upgrade the state's aging electric utility infrastructure and to reduce regulatory lag.","The Missouri General Assembly is not expected to advance legislation to modernize the state's regulatory framework this year. As we have stated in the past, the execution of our near-term rate base and earnings growth plans are not contingent on enhancement of the Missouri framework. As the energy industry continues to change and advance, we remain committed to educating stakeholders in our effort to help Missouri remain competitive and build the grid of the future. We are convinced such an enhancement is in the best long-term interest of our customers and the state. As a result, we will continue to work with the commission, legislators and others and aggressively advocate for improvement of the Missouri regulatory framework.","Last, with regard to the complaint cases pending at the FERC challenging MISO's base allowed ROE of 12.38% for transmission services, we and other MISO transmission owners are strongly advocating for an ROE level that is fair and that will continue to incentivize the transmission investment needed to ensure a robust grid for our nation. To that end, we and others filed testimony in April. I strongly believe that the FERC supports additional investment in our nation's transmission infrastructure and will continue to provide a regulatory framework including an ROE that will incentivize that investment. FERC's review of this matter is expected to continue over the next year.","Turning now to Page 7 and our long-term growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 to 2019 period. We have a strong pipeline of investments that we expect to bring superior value to our customers and shareholders over the next 5 years and beyond. As shown on this page, the growth rates of our jurisdictional investments are aligned with the perspectives I just shared on our regulatory frameworks. We are executing on numerous FERC-regulated electric transmission projects, including multi-value projects such as Illinois Rivers, as well as an extensive list of local reliability projects.","Further, we are making investments to strengthen our electric delivery system and install electric smart meters consistent with the Ameren Illinois' 10-year Modernization Action Plan. And we are making meaningful investments in our Illinois gas delivery system to upgrade metering equipment, while also replacing and modernizing certain mains, lines and controls to ensure safety and reliability. To earn a timely return on incremental Illinois gas delivery investments, we began using the state's gas infrastructure rider in the first quarter of this year.","Last, in Missouri, we are focused on providing safe and reliable energy to our customers as we seek to align our overall spending with the recent rate case outcome. We expect our solid base growth to be the primary driver of superior earnings growth for our shareholders. Further, looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize the importance of dividends to our shareholders. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. In closing, we are committed to executing our strategy, and we expect this focus to deliver superior value to both our customers and our shareholders.","Again, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. And I'll now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone.","Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, today, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share for the year-ago period Key drivers of this earnings increase are listed on this page. Higher electric transmission and delivery infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois under formula ratemaking increased earnings by $0.05 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The earnings comparison also benefited by $0.05 per share from reduced operations and maintenance expenses for those businesses not operating under formula rates.","In addition, the January 2015 Illinois Commerce Commission order approving recovery of Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage costs increased earnings by $0.04 per share compared with the first quarter of last year. Earnings also benefited by $0.03 per share from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower cost short-term debt.","Moving now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. Lower electric and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.03 per share of this decline and the balance due to energy efficiency and other drivers. First quarter 2015 temperatures were milder than those experienced during the polar vortex in the year-ago quarter, but were still colder than normal. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers across our systems decreased by approximately 1%, with about 1\/2 of this decrease due to energy efficiency programs.","In Missouri, the effect of declines in electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs is offset by revenue recovery authorized under the state's Energy Efficiency Investment Act. Kilowatt hour sales to industrial customers in Illinois increased 2%. However, sales to industrial customers in Missouri declined 4%, primarily due to lower sales to Noranda Aluminum, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Sales to Noranda declined because of sustained operational issues at their plant.","Next, the earnings contribution from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which I noted a moment ago, was reduced by lower recognized allowed ROEs. Transmission earnings for the year-ago quarter incorporated the current MISO base allowed ROE of 12.38%. However, this year's first quarter results were reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower ROE from the pending complaint cases at the FERC. The net ROE recognized in our transmission earnings is consistent with the level incorporated into our 2015 earnings guidance as discussed on our February 25 call.","Regarding first quarter 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings, these incorporated an 8.6% allowed ROE compared with 9.7% in the year-ago period. This decline was due to a decrease in the assumed annual average 30-year Treasury rate from 3.9% to 2.8%. Of course, this year's Illinois electric delivery earnings will incorporate the actual 2015 average 30-year treasury rate, which I would note that interest rates have recently been rising. Other factors weighing on the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased Ameren Missouri financing cost as noted on this page. These reflected in part the impact of capital projects placed in service by Ameren Missouri over the last 12 months.","Turning now to Page 10. First, I would like to remind you that today, we have affirmed our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Moving to the details on this page. Here, we list select items for you to consider as you update your 2015 earnings models. These include the effect on earnings that a return to normal temperatures would have on this year's remaining quarters compared with those of last year. Over the balance of this year, we expect increased earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric delivery services as we continue to make significant infrastructure investments under formula ratemaking.","In addition, capitalized financing costs are expected to decline this year, reflecting the significant Ameren Missouri capital projects that were in process and ultimately placed into service late last year. Earnings for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from a lower effective income tax rate. Our forecasted 2015 effective income tax rate is approximately 38%, a decrease from the 2014 effective rate which was approximately 39%. In addition, I want to remind you of factors that will affect the fourth quarter comparison. The absence of a Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage this year is expected to boost fourth quarter 2015 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared with the year-ago quarter. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2016.","Finally, this year's fourth quarter will reflect the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption costs of $0.03 per share. Of course, these are only some of the factors that will have an effect on balance of the year 2015 earnings as compared with 2014.","Turning now to Page 11 and regulatory matters. Here, we provide details on the recent Missouri rate order. As Warner already mentioned, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a $122 million annual increase in Ameren Missouri's retail electric rates. This amount was comprised of $109 million for increased net energy costs and $13 million for other non-energy costs. The Missouri commission authorized continuation of 2 very important and constructive cost recovery mechanisms, the fuel adjustment clause and the pension and other postretirement benefit cost tracking mechanism.","However, as Warner mentioned, the commission eliminated our ability to recover changes in transmission revenues and expenses through the fuel adjustment clause. The commission also discontinued 2 other cost trackers, one for vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost and another for storm costs. The commission did state in its order that Ameren Missouri can request an accounting authority order to defer extraordinary storm costs incurred between rate cases for possible inclusion in rates in a future rate case. In years past, Ameren Missouri has been granted such storm cost accounting orders and later authorized to recover these costs in future rate cases.","Moving to Page 12 and further details of the Missouri electric rate decision. Here, we provide a breakdown of the key drivers of the $13 million authorized annual increase in other nonenergy revenue. As Warner noted, we're disappointed with this rate decision and will seek to align our overall operating and capital spending with this outcome. And as we have stated repeatedly, our objective is to earn a return on equity at or close to our allowed level. Given Missouri's use of historical test years and now more limited riders and trackers, this objective will be more challenging. However, we are clearly focused on the issue. And as we have done in the past, we'll be taking several actions to achieve this objective.","Turning now to Page 13. I will update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois, last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $110 million increase in net annual electric rates to reflect 2014 actual costs, expected 2015 infrastructure investments and prior period under-recoveries of costs. A summary of our filing is included in the appendix to this presentation.","The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing.","We also have a natural gas delivery rate case pending in Illinois. In January of this year, we requested a $53 million annual increase based on the future test year ending in December 2016. Our filing also included a proposal for a decoupling mechanism that would permit us to collect our authorized revenue requirement from residential and small nonresidential customers independent of sales volume fluctuations. We expect the ICC to issue a decision by December with new rates effective by January of next year. A summary of this filing is also included in the appendix to today's presentation.","Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. The FERC's schedule for the initial case calls for hearings to begin in mid-August with an initial order from an administrative law judge expected by the end of November of this year and a final order from the FERC expected next year.","Finally, turning to Page 14. I will summarize our comments this morning. We delivered solid first quarter earnings and affirmed earnings per share guidance range for this year of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. As Warner discussed, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We also continue to expect 6% compound annual rate base growth over the 2014 through 2019 period based on a transparent mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions.","Importantly, we are strategically allocating capital to those jurisdictions with modernized regulatory frameworks that support investment. We believe this highly visible growth is outstanding compared to our regulated utility peers and provides the foundation for superior long-term growth in earnings per share. Further, Ameren's $1.64 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with a current yield of approximately 4%, which is above average compared to our peers. Through this expected earnings growth, coupled with our dividend yield, translates into a very attractive total return proposition for investors.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Julien here. So first question, if you will, on the Missouri case and I apologize if this didn't come across. When is your next expected filing? And how are you thinking about addressing the presumably incremental lag coming from some of the changes in the latest filing? And what's the magnitude of that lag that you would anticipate having from the transmission expense, along with some of the other tweaks?","Martin J. Lyons","So there are multiple questions in there, Julien, and I'll take a stab at those and maybe others can chime in and supplement as we go. And if I miss any of your questions, we'll let you repeat it. I think your first question was about when we're going to file our next rate case. I mean, obviously, we just received this commission order. We're in the process of assessing the order and also considering what matters we may ask the commission to consider rehearing on. So I wouldn't say we're even through the full process of this one. So it's certainly premature to think about the timing of a next rate case. What goes into that obviously is assessing this order, its impact. As we mentioned on the call and as you just alluded to, we're going to be taking a number of actions to align spending with this rate case outcome. We'll be looking at our capital expenditures moving forward and the in-service dates. And all of those things are going to factor into a decision about when a next rate case may be. Probably important to note that this rate case was about 2.5 years since our last rate increase. So no telling when the next one will be, but like I said, those are the various things we'll take into consideration. You also asked, I think, about some of those actions that we may be taking to address any lag coming out of this order. And I think that whenever you go into a rate case, it's certainly expected that cost savings that you've achieved over the past couple of years, in our case, help to mitigate the rate increase for the customer. And that's certainly what's happened here. And then what you have to do going forward is, to the extent that there are nonrecovered costs for certain areas of your business that you're going to identify actions that you can take within your business to overcome those, to offset those. As I said on the call, our goal continues to be to earn at or very near to our allowed returns, and that's going to be our objective going forward. And without providing any specifics, certainly have processes underway today as part of our annual planning processes to identify and implement those actions which are needed to achieve that objective.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And could you perhaps quantify a little bit what your lag expectations are? I suppose it's a little early, right, in the context of identifying offsetting cost cuts. And then maybe just more specifically on the transmission expense side. How much of the rate lag specifically or what kind of inflation rate have you been seeing of late? I imagine that's probably the most critical item there.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Sure. That's right. Those were parts of your other question. I guess, number one, Julien, we don't think about sort of an amount of lag that we're targeting or that we expect. As I said a moment ago, I mean, our objective is to earn at or very close to our allowed return. That has been our objective, and it continues to be our objective. Now there are going to be elements that are things that would have to be overcome. Now we'll -- on this transmission piece in the FAC, there, what's happened is transmission revenues and costs are coming out of the FAC and then would go into base rates and would be handled that way subject to potential rehearing on that issue with the commission. I would tell you that today, just to give you an order of magnitude, in 2015, we expect transmission revenues and transmission expenses in Ameren Missouri to be around $35 million. However, those revenues and those expenses change over time. And one of the reasons that we view them as being appropriate for being in the FAC is that, frankly, those costs are outside of our control and they can be volatile. And to give an example, I think what was put into our base rates reflected a differential between revenues and expenses of about $6 million where revenues had exceeded expenses. So that gives you, I think, some sense of the magnitude of the numbers and the change we've seen here recently. Hard to say what the change will be prospectively. Obviously, again, as I said, those costs are outside of our control. So what that may -- if it's not in the FAC, what that may mean for us in terms of prospective lag is really uncertain at this time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. But just to be clear, though, if you may permit me. Your expectation is that you will be able to continue to earn at or around your earned or your authorized level?","Martin J. Lyons","Julien, that is our objective, and we work each year to align our costs to achieve that objective. Julien, I just would add on that, I mean, I think we have a good track record that we've shown over this past couple of years of actually achieving that objective. But thank you for your questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the long-term growth rate, which -- how should we think about that now?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, in terms of the long-term growth rate, you're speaking about the rate base or the earnings per share?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm talking about the earnings per share. That doesn't seem to be in the slide deck this time around.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Sure. That's fine, Paul. I just wanted to clarify. I mean, obviously, in the slides we talked about our 6% compound annual rate base growth from '14 to '19. I mean, you're right. What we didn't do is specifically mention the earnings per share growth. And I think going forward, the reason for that is really simply that we plan to formally update you and others on the long-term earnings growth plans on an annual basis, consistent with our annual planning cycles. But that being said, as we sit here today, we do continue to be confident in our ability to deliver within that 7% to 10% compound earnings per share growth range that we previously talked about, which is from 2013 to 2018. As you know, Paul, that growth is driven by base growth that I just mentioned. It's driven by reduction in parent and other costs that we've been achieving. It's driven by the modernization and reinvestment of tax assets that we have, about $440 million of tax assets at the parent company. And also incorporated in there is our expectation of rising interest rates in achieving that 7% to 10% growth. What we don't plan to do is provide quarterly updates on the long-term plans going forward based on, I would say, short-term movements in interest rates or changes in allowed returns. We take all of that data, of course, into consideration as we prepare our -- do our annual planning and think about where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to modify our longer-term growth plan.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Now the -- so I guess that means -- does that mean that like from quarter-to-quarter internally you guys might think that this number might be changing? Or is this more of a sort of a cosmetic thing in terms of just simply leaving it alone until the -- in a more annual basis because that would make more sense than changing it, I guess, quarterly or quarter. Is that -- how should we think about that?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure. Sure, Paul. It's a fair question. No, I mean, what we're not doing, I would say, is internally updating our 5-year earnings per share growth outlook each quarter based on changes. It's frankly a fairly comprehensive process that we and I'm sure other companies go through on an annual basis to think about changes in long-term interest rate forecast, long-term ROE forecast, changes in regulatory frameworks, changes in customer needs, changes in technology and really think about what kinds of investment should be made for the benefit of our customers, where they should be made, when they should be made. And all of those things factor into our long-term investment plans and our long-term EPS growth. So we do, do those comprehensive planning processes on an annual basis. And we'll be planning then to roll that out and roll it into the guidance we provide you and others on an annual basis about what our long-term growth plans are. Paul, I would just add a couple months ago, when we provided our guidance, I was asked a question about, \"Well, are you going to hit that 7% to 10% in the current ROE environment?\" And what I'd said on that call, and I certainly stand by is that, if we held the ROEs that were embedded into our guidance flat through time, we still expect to be in that 7% to 10% range, albeit potentially at the lower end. And I have to say that while we haven't completely reassessed our long-term model, I do remain confident that even with this lower Missouri ROE and holding the other ROEs embedded in our current guidance flat, we do have that flexibility within the guidance range and within our business plans to be able to achieve at least that 7% end of our growth. So and that growth, as you know, that 7% earnings per share growth is superior, I think, to the average of our regulated peers. And we fully expect that interest rates over time will rise, that ROEs will rise, and that will certainly help to drive earnings higher within that range.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just to sort of follow-up here on the regulatory environment and the legislative environment in Missouri. You guys went over the rate case. Not exactly what you guys wanted and it looks like the legislative efforts, if I understand you guys, they're dead for this year. Do you think that there's any rate case fatigue? I mean, let me put it right out there. I mean, do you think that there's maybe -- there may be a limit in terms of revenue increases in Missouri? And then just to sort of follow that through, do you have any opinion of the legislation that's happening in Illinois with respect to nuclear and the other sort of clean job stuff and what have you that's been garnering a lot of attention in Springfield?","Martin J. Lyons","Paul, we'll try -- this is Marty again. We'll try to take those in order. I think on the Missouri ones -- and maybe Michael Moehn, who's with us here who's the head of our Missouri operations could take the first part of your question.","Michael L. Moehn","Yes. Great. Thanks, Marty. With respect to the fatigue, certainly, these increases have been hard on customers. We recognize that. We try to do everything we can to mitigate the impact on customers. But at the end of the day, all of these investments that we're making are really to continue to provide safe and adequate and reliable service. And so we're going to continue to do what we think is necessary to deliver on that promise. And with respect to legislation in Missouri, we do remain very focused on trying to get something across the finish line. And we continue to talk with stakeholders, legislators about the importance of modernizing the regulations in Missouri to make sure that we're able to continue to build out the grid of the 21st century. We'll continue to remind them of the good things that are going on in Illinois, referencing what's happening in Arkansas and Wisconsin and Michigan. And so I think through a constant, relentless pursuit of it, we're going to get it across the finish line at some point. It's difficult to say exactly when it's going to be -- when that's going to happen, but we are going to continue to put every effort into making that happen.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But it won't be this year, right?","Michael L. Moehn","Yes. I think that is a fair assumption at this point in time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then if you could follow-up on Illinois. I don't want to take up any more time.","Warner L. Baxter","Yes, that's okay. Paul, this is Warner. Richard Mark is here too. So Richard, maybe you can give a little perspective on the Illinois legislation?","Richard J. Mark","Well, there's 3 bills pending in Illinois. We're just continuing to monitor those bills to see which one of them will -- which of them will be called for hearings in the near future. The session in Illinois ends May 31. So we're going to continue to monitor those to see which ones -- how they affect our customers through improvements and value, as well as the impact that would have on increased cost to our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","You guys have answered a lot of my questions. I was looking back at the disclosures from the end of the year call. And I can't remember, did you disclose explicitly what ROE you're reserving to or was it just that you're making assumptions that are less explicit?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Greg. This is Marty. What we had talked about on that call and repeat here, I mean, obviously, we've got active litigation and we don't want to get into specifics. But what we did say then is our guidance reflected approximately the outcome of the ISO New England order last year, plus a 50 basis point adder. And that kind of an ROE was embedded into our guidance, and that's what we continue to reflect in our ongoing results. And it's also reflected in our current guidance for 2015.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quick, I want to make sure I understand some things. In the quarter, O&M was down a lot this quarter and came in a good bit better. Can you just talk about whether that's seasonality, whether there were some things that will put upwards pressure on O&M towards the back half of the year or is this a kind of a new run rate?","Martin J. Lyons","Michael, I'll try to answer as best I can. This is Marty again, obviously. But yes, the O&M was down. The O&M was down principally at Missouri. When you see the 10-Q, you'll get some further detailed breakdown, I suppose, by legal entity. But I'll tell you that Illinois was about flat and the real driver was lower Missouri. And I would say that, that's just, in general, just efforts to contain cost. There were some specific costs that we had last year at our Callaway plant that did not recur in the current period. But I would say, overall, our focus is to continue to work to improve the productivity of our operations, to find ways to control cost. And I can't really be specific with you in terms of trends for the remainder of the year in O&M. But I will tell you that just in general and especially in light of the rate case outcome that we had, we're going to continue to be very cost conscious and manage O&M very carefully.","Warner L. Baxter","Michael, I'd just add, this is Warner. This is not something new. This is not something new. We have been very disciplined in managing our costs. And as Marty rightfully said a moment ago is, we manage those costs between rate cases. It helps address regulatory lag. And then as we have the rate cases, it certainly provides a significant benefit to customers. And we're not done. We're going to continue to do that, both in Missouri and across our enterprise because it's the right thing to do. And so I know others have raised the questions on regulatory lag. We cite that, obviously, the regulatory lag may become more challenging. At the same time, we're geared up to address those issues internally and are still very focused and confident that the execution of our plan is going to deliver superior value to -- not just to our shareholders, but also to our customers.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And want to a circle back on the transmission ROE. Your guidance assumed a lower ROE. Is there any change in the guidance level, the ROE? I know this is piggybacking off of Greg's question a little bit. But want to just make sure I understand kind of the puts and takes versus original guidance and what you're saying today.","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Michael. I'll reiterate. Basically, what's in our new guidance, our current updated guidance reflects exactly what we had in our guidance in the beginning of the year. So we said then and we say now what it reflects is basically the outcome of the ISO New England order, plus 50 basis points. And so that gives you an approximation of where we're booking a reserve to, what the effective earned ROE is that we're reflecting in our financial statement this year. Obviously, we don't know where those cases will come out. We certainly think that the testimony that was filed by the MISO TOs and our own witnesses speak for itself. And we'll let that play out here over the remainder of the year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. One last item. Thinking about Illinois and MISO transmission opportunities. I mean, you've got a very healthy rate base growth opportunity there over the next 4 or 5 years. But trying to think about what could be incremental to what's already in your plan. Can you talk a little bit about the Order 1000 process on the MISO and whether projects are soon to be put out to bid or whether there's another round of potential Order 1000-related projects that you could potentially be a participant in an RFP on or updates on the MTEP process as well?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Michael. I think the best person to speak to that is Maureen Borkowski, who's the head of our transmission business. Maureen, do you want to comment on this question?","Maureen A. Borkowski","Sure. MISO is in the process of getting some Order 1000 things started. They're a little behind the curve relative to the other RTOs. And just to clarify, at the present time, our business development folks are active not only in the MISO Order 1000 process, but also in PJM and Southwest Power Pool. We actually have some proposals active in some of the PJM solicitation windows right now. And as you've mentioned correctly, any kind of success in that venue, in any of those MISO, PJM, SPP, is all incremental to the rate base growth and investment that we've already talked about today. But we're not necessarily relying on that to provide our future growth pipeline. We have a great deal of investment opportunity remaining in our utility systems, both for reliability needs, aging infrastructure replacement and modernization of the grid. We also expect the Clean Power Plan will likely have some impact on the generation fleet in our service territory, which will also drive local transmission projects. And all of those opportunities that I mentioned are really ours to deliver on. They're not subject to any of the competitive process in MISO. So we certainly are active in the competitive space, but we're not relying on that to provide our pipeline. We have lots of other opportunities as well.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. I just wanted to kind of tail on to that only because yesterday on an earnings call, one of the Kansas utilities talked about the SPP and just mentioned that they had only put out one small Order 1000 project bid, no others for RFP. Do you know the number of potential projects that the MISO is likely to put out to bid and when those RFPs would come out?","Maureen A. Borkowski","I really couldn't speculate on that. It is supposed to be in the MTEP 2016 process, I guess, which begins effectively in August of this year. So sometime late next year.","Martin J. Lyons","Michael, it's Marty. Just a couple of things. I think it was implied in your question, but obviously, our rate base growth plans that we put out there today and in prior call, 6% doesn't include any kind of expectation for any kind of FERC Order 1000 competitive wins. So if anything was achieved there, it'd certainly be incremental. As Maureen described, we've got a good pipeline of local reliability projects. That goes on beyond the 5-year period. Certainly, there could be some incremental for our current 5-year plan. But I'd also mention that as we discussed last time, I think you asked a question in the last call and I responded, I mean, certainly, there could be of an incremental investment in other areas of our business, particularly in the gas area, where there's the possibility that new federal rules will come into play that will actually cause us to increase the amount of investment that we need to make for replacement of aging infrastructure. So there are number of things, including transmission on top of transmission that present additional rate base growth opportunity. Appreciate the question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session.

(Operator Instructions)","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Fischer, you may now begin.","Doug Fischer","","Thank you and good morning. I am Doug Fischer, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Tom Voss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Marty Lyons, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Ameren management team. ","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call is being broadcast live on the internet, and the webcast will be available for one year on our website at Ameren.com. Further, this call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast. Redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on our website that will be referenced during this call. To access this presentation, please look in the investor section of our website under webcasts and presentations, and follow the appropriate link. ","Turning to page two of the presentation, I need to inform you that comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in the forward-looking statement. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statement section in the news release we issued today, and the forward-looking statements and risk factor sections in our filings with the SEC. ","Tom will begin this call with an overview of second quarter 2012 earnings and 2012 guidance, followed by a discussion of recent regulatory and business developments. Marty will follow with more detailed discussions of second quarter 2012 financial results, and regulatory and other financial matters. We will then open the call for questions. Here\u2019s Tom, who will start on page three of the presentation. ","Thomas Voss","","Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m pleased to report that today we released second quarter 2012 core earnings of $.73 per share, compared to $.59 per share of core earnings in the second quarter of 2011. This improvement reflected increased earnings from our regulated utility operations, partially offset by decreased earnings from our merchant generation operations. ","Key drivers of the higher regulated utility earnings were a favorable federal energy regulatory commission order related to a disputed Ameren Missouri power purchase agreement that expired in 2009, the absence in 2012 of a 2011 Ameren Missouri charge to earnings related to the fuel adjustment clause and 2011 Missouri electric and 2012 Illinois gas rate adjustments. ","Other factors having a favorable effect on second quarter 2012 regulated utility earnings compared to second quarter 2011 regulated utility earnings included reduced storm-related costs and increased electric sales to native load customers resulting from warmer temperatures. ","Merchant generation earnings were negatively impacted by lower prices for electricity. Marty will provide more details on our second quarter earnings in a few minutes. ","Turning to page four, based on second quarter results, today we are raising our 2012 core earnings guidance range to $2.25 to $2.55 per share, from a prior range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Our core earnings guidance range for our merchant generation business segment remains $.05 to $.15 per share. The favorable earnings impact of warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures, and the previously mentioned FERC order on the disputed power purchase agreement, have led us to raise core guidance for our regulated utility businesses by $.05 per share, at both the low and high ends of the range, to a new range of $2.20 to $2.40 per share. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of the year, and so far third quarter temperatures have been much warmer than normal, and I am very pleased to note that during the current extended period of very warm weather, which began with record temperatures in May, our utility systems have performed well, demonstrating the value of the significant reliability investments we have made in recent years. ","Extreme weather puts strains not only on our system, but also on our customers we serve and our employees. We continue to provide a range of assistance to help low-income customers cope with the impacts of warm weather. These include promoting and contributing to programs that assist low-income customers with their bills, and annual donations of residential air conditioning units to local charities for distribution. ","I also want to commend our employees, especially our generating center, substation mechanics and line workers, for their dedication and focus on safety. They work hard in the heat, so that our customers can stay cool. ","Moving to page five, we have significant electric rate cases pending in both Missouri and Illinois, with decisions from utility regulators in these states expected later this year. While Marty will update you on other details of these proceedings, I want to touch on some policy issues. We continue to believe that modern, constructive regulatory frameworks, which provide timely cash flows and a reasonable opportunity to earn fair return on investments, are clearly in the best long-term interest of our customers and the states in which we operate. These frameworks support our ability to attract capital on terms which facilitate the timely investment needed to modernize our regulated utilities companies\u2019 aging infrastructure and meet customers\u2019 expectations for safe, reliable and clean energy. Constructive regulatory framework and the investment they facilitate, also help create good-paying jobs. ","In our pending electric rate case in Missouri, we are seeking recovery of costs and investments we have already made to serve customers. Further, we are seeking to enhance the existing regulatory framework in the state. As a result, we have made several new proposals in this case. First, we are requesting approval of a storm cost-tracking mechanism that will provide the opportunity to recover costs, to restore service after major storms in a manner that is fair to both our customers and our investors. Second, we are requesting approval of a new plant in service accounting proposal. This proposal is designed to reduce the impact of regulatory lag on earnings and future cash flows related to assets placed in service between rate cases. ","In a related regulatory matter, early this year, Ameren Missouri filed the request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for approval of new and expanded energy efficiency programs for the three-year period beginning in January, 2013. This was the utility\u2019s first request under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEEIA. Last month all of the parties to the energy efficiency proceeding filed a stipulation in agreement with the Missouri Public Service Commission, resolving all related issues, and yesterday the PSC unanimously approved this agreement. This agreement aligns the utility\u2019s financial incentives with those of customers, consistent with the MEEIA legislation, that provides timely recovery of the expected costs of the energy efficiency programs we will implement beginning in January of 2013, and the revenue requirement for these program costs will be included in our pending electric rate case, with true-ups to actual costs in future rate cases. ","And also for the first time, we will receive timely recovery through rates that is designed to offset revenue losses of fixed costs occurring as a result of implementing our energy efficiency programs. Further, the calculation for such recovery will be based on predetermined values for specific energy efficiency actions, rather than difficult and often contentious after-the-fact measurement. Here also, the associated revenue requirement will be included in the pending rate case, with true-ups in future rate cases. ","Finally, the energy efficiency agreement will provide an opportunity for us to earn a performance incentive to reflect the rate base growth foregone as a result of our energy efficiency programs. Any earned performance incentive will be calculated and collected after 2015, with any earnings benefit expected to be recognized in 2016. ","Moving now to Illinois, constructive formula ratemaking is in place for our state-regulated electric delivery service, and as Marty will discuss, our initial and first annual uptake formula rate cases are pending before the ICC. Given the constructive formula ratemaking framework, we are moving forward with plans to invest meaningful incremental capital in this business. Over the next 10 years, our Illinois electric delivery business is required to invest $625 million over and above levels we have been spending in recent years, and create 450 jobs during the peak program year. The improved infrastructure resulting from these investments will enhance reliability and provide customers with the energy usage options made possible by smart meters. ","Turning now to page six, I would like to update you on progress on growing our investments in FERC-regulated transmission projects at the Ameren Illinois and Ameren Transmission companies. Such projects benefit from constructive FERC formula ratemaking. Ameren Illinois is moving forward with its plans to invest approximately $900 million across some 300 projects over the five years ending in 2016, which are focused on reliability and local load growth needs. As shown in the pie chart, three-quarters of the planned $900 million investment is in projects that do not require regulatory approval because they are improving or rebuilding existing lines. The remaining investments, which are for five Greenfield projects, do require regulatory approval, and as noted on the slide, two of these projects have already been granted such certificates. ","On page seven, we provide an update on Ameren Transmission Company, our ATX projects. ATX is moving forward with its plans to invest approximately $750 million in Greenfield regional projects within Illinois and Missouri over the five years ending in 2016. The bulk of ATX\u2019s investment over this period will be in the $800 million+ Illinois Rivers project, a MISO-approved regional multi-value project to build a transmission line across the state of Illinois. We are currently holding public meetings on route design for this project. Later this year, we plan to file for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and an ICC decision will be issued by July of 2013. Once we receive the certificate, we will begin to acquire right of way. Preliminary construction may start as early as 2013, with a full range of construction activities in 2014. ","Meanwhile, we recently filed with the FERC requesting the same constructive rate treatment that we\u2019ve already received for the Illinois Rivers Project for ATX\u2019s two other MISO-approved regional multi-value projects. ","Turning now to page eight, I would like to comment on our merchant generation business. We continue to act to adjust this business to weak power prices and an uncertain timeline for their recovery. As we discussed in our first quarter call, our merchant generation business filed a request for a variance within the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard, or MPS, with the Illinois Pollution Control Board in May. In our petition, we outlined our need for additional time to comply with SO2 emission levels, currently set to become effective January 1st, 2015. In exchange for delaying compliance with these levels through 2020, we have proposed a compliance plan that restricts our SO2 emissions through 2014 to levels lower than those required by the existing MPS, thereby offsetting the environmental impact of granting the variance relief. ","Further, our variance compliance plan will also comply with federal emission rules that are currently stayed, but are under review by the federal courts. There has been significant public interest in our variance request with various citizens\u2019 groups and the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s office, opposing, and labor and local community interests supporting the variance request. Only the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and our merchant business are parties to proceedings. The Illinois EPA has filed a neutral recommendation, but has noted that our compliance plan results in a net environmental benefit. ","If we are not granted the variance or power prices do not materially increase, there is a significant risk that we\u2019ll have to mothball two of our three unscrubbed merchant generation coal-fired energy centers beginning in 2015. The Pollution Control Board held a hearing on our variance request just yesterday, and must decide the matter by September 20th of this year. ","I want to conclude my prepared remarks by noting that the focus of our dedicated employees on maintaining solid operating performance and improving customer service, our active management of our merchant generation business and our disciplined cost management and capital allocation, all reinforce my optimism as to the future prospects of Ameren. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty. ","Martin Lyons","","Thanks, Tom. Turning to page nine in the presentation. Today we reported second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $.87 per share, compared to second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $.57 per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded second quarter 2012 core earnings of $.73 per share, compared to second quarter 2011 core earnings of $.59 per share. ","Our second quarter 2012 core earnings excluded two items that are included in GAAP earnings. The largest of these non-core items was the increase in income tax benefit as a result of the first quarter 2012 non-cash asset impairment charge at our merchant generation business, and the GAAP requirement to recognize quarterly income tax expense using the annual estimated effective income tax rate. This item increased net income by $.18 per share in the second quarter of 2012, partially reversing the $.36 per share first quarter 2012 charge. We expect the remaining $.18 per share of this year-to-date expense to be fully reversed by the end of the year. The second non-core item is a $.04 per share loss from the net effect of unrealized mark-to-market activity. ","On page 10, we highlight key factors that drove the $.14 per share improvement in second quarter 2012 core earnings compared to second quarter 2011 core earnings. These key factors included electric and gas rate adjustments, net of certain related expenses, which increased earnings by $.09 per share. Electric rates changed in Missouri in late July of last year, and gas delivery rates changed in Illinois in January of this year. ","A second factor favorably impacting the comparison was the previously discussed favorable FERC order regarding a disputed power purchase agreement. This added $.07 per share to second quarter 2012 earnings. The earnings comparison also benefited from the absence of the previously discussed second quarter 2011 FAC-related charge of $.05 per share. In addition, lower storm-related costs benefited second quarter 2012 earnings by $.04 per share. You\u2019ll recall that we experienced severe storms in the second quarter of last year, resulting in high storm restoration expenses. Further, warmer-than-normal temperatures boosted earnings by an estimated $.03 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2011, a period that was also warmer than normal. We estimate that the warm second quarter 2012 temperatures increased earnings by $.07 per share compared to normal, offsetting a significant part of the estimated $.10 per share negative impact compared to normal experienced in the first quarter of this year due to mild winter temperatures. ","Second quarter 2012 cooling degree days were 30% greater than normal and 15% greater than those experienced in the second quarter of 2011. Reflecting this, second quarter 2012 KWh sales of electricity to weather-sensitive residential and commercial utility customers rose 2% compared to the second quarter of 2011. ","Excluding the impacts of weather, we estimate the second quarter and first half 2012 KWh sales for residential and commercial customers were flat with those of the second quarter and first half of 2011. A decline in margins at the merchant generation business reduced earnings by $.10 per share, primarily a result of lower power prices. ","Turning now to page 11. We have raised our 2012 cash flow projection. We now expect 2012 negative free cash flow of approximately $190 million, an improvement of 40 million from our prior projection. The improved cash flow outlook reflects higher expected cash flows from operations as a result of the previously-discussed favorable FERC order and our increased earnings expectations. As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our projected cash flows from operating activities, and subtracting from it expected capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends and net advances for construction. While we anticipate that free cash flow will be negative for Ameren as a whole, we expect our merchant generation business will cover its own cash needs. ","Moving to page 12 of our presentation, I would like to update you on selected recent regulatory developments impacting our various business segments. Beginning with Ameren Missouri, as I mentioned earlier, the FERC has issued a favorable order in a longstanding case involving the disputed power purchase agreement that expired in 2009. The FERC\u2019s May 2012 order confirmed its 2010 ruling that Entergy Arkansas should not have included additional charges to Ameren Missouri under the power purchase agreement, and required Entergy to refund the improper charges with interest. Ameren Missouri received cash reimbursement from Entergy in June. The portion of the reimbursement related to power purchased before implementation of the Missouri Fuel Adjustment clause in February of 2009, an amount that was never included in customers\u2019 rates, was reflected in second quarter 2012 earnings. Meanwhile, Entergy has appealed the FERC order in the U.S. Court of Appeals. ","In a second recent regulatory development involving our Missouri Utility, the state circuit court has reversed the Missouri Public Service Commission\u2019s 2011 order requiring that $18 million related to sales ending in September of 2009 under certain wholesale contracts be flowed to customers through the FAC. As a result of that 2011 PSC order, we took a charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2011, and have completed flowing these funds to customers through the FAC. In response to the favorable circuit court ruling, the PSC recently appealed the matter to the Missouri Court of Appeals, and a decision is not expected until 2013. As a result, we have not reversed the charge we took in 2011. The PSC has reviewed the final $26 million relating to these same wholesale contracts for the period ending in May, 2011, and is expected to issue a decision later this year as to whether this additional amount should be flowed to customers through the FAC. A negative PSC decision on this matter would result in a charge to earnings. ","At the top of page 13, we list a recent positive development impacting our Ameren Illinois electric delivery business. Last month, the ICC decided to consider Ameren Illinois\u2019 modified Smart Grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure, or AMI, deployment plan. Installing Smart Grid equipment and advanced two-way electric meters is critical to meeting the infrastructure enhancements required under the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act that authorized formula rates, and such expenditures comprise about half of the increase in capital spending required by the act. ","In March, 2012, Ameren Illinois submitted its original Smart Grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure deployment plan to the ICC, and the ICC subsequently denied that plan in May of 2012. The ICC ruled that Ameren Illinois\u2019 original plan did not provide enough support to prove that it was cost-beneficial for electric customers. Ameren Illinois asked for a  rehearing and filed the modified deployment plan designed to address the ICC\u2019s concerns about cost justification. Our rehearing filling demonstrated a positive net present value for a plan which provides for the installation of advanced electric meters for 62% of electric customers within 10 years. The ICC is scheduled to rule on our modified plan in November of 2012, and we are optimistic about a positive outcome. Assuming ICC approval, we would begin our construction of infrastructure in the third quarter of 2013, with the first meters to be installed in the second quarter of 2014. ","And finally, I would like to update you on a recent FERC regulatory development. In June, the FERC issued an order in the electric capacity construct filing of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, or MISO. The FERC approved MISO\u2019s request to change the capacity construct to an annual, from a monthly capacity construct, beginning with the 2013-2014 planning year. We are disappointed with the FERC\u2019s order and continue to maintain that a multi-year or forward capacity construct is necessary to provide the transparent price signals needed to ensure electric reliability over the long term. However, in an encouraging aspect of the order, the FERC directed staff to solicit comments in a separate proceeding on the issue of capacity portability between MISO and PJM. This includes an examination of administrative rules that may act as barriers to capacity transfers across the MISO-PJM scene, and potential solutions. We continue to support the removal of unnecessary barriers to capacity portability across the scene, as a means of improving market efficiency. ","Moving to page 14, I would like to update you on the first of our two pending Illinois electric delivery formula rate case. While the outcome of the initial case filed in January of this year will establish the level of rates charged to customers from October through the end of this year, it is important to emphasized that full-year 2012 electric delivery earnings will reflect a true-up for 2012 rate base, actual cost of service and the formula-based return on equity, as well as historical ICC ratemaking adjustments. To assist you in thinking about the expected 2012 earnings power of our Illinois electric delivery business, we have provided estimates of several of the key inputs into the rate formula. ","Moving to a discussion of the pending initial formula rate case, this filing, as we updated it in July, called for a $20 million annual rate decrease compared to current rates. In July, the ICC staff filed their most recent testimony in this case. The ICC staff recommended that rates be decreased by 29 million annually, more than the Ameren Illinois\u2019 updated proposal. The ICC staff\u2019s recommended revenue requirement reflects $20 million of lower rate base, with $14 million of this $20 million the result of downward rate base adjustments for estimated, accumulated, deferred income taxes. We have listed several of the other staff-recommended adjustments to the revenue requirement on this page. ","On page 15, we have summarized the positions of the other major interveners in this case. The revenue requirement recommended by these parties range from $33 to 37 million lower than our updated request, and many of their positions on the issues are similar to those of the staff. We, and the other parties to this case, have different views on another issue related to the rate base and capitalization amounts to be used for both ratemaking and the eventual earnings true-up calculation. We argue that the legislation specifies that rate base and capitalization for a given year should be based on year-end values. The ICC staff and other interveners recommended that the ICC use average values for a given year. In fact, the ICC adopted average values in a recent Commonwealth Edison order. However, in late June, the ICC voted unanimously to rehear certain parts of its May Commonwealth Edison order, including the use of average as compared to year-end rate base and the method for calculating interest on the revenue requirement reconciliation. ","In addition to these issues, the Attorney General has recommended an additional $7 million revenue reduction by crediting Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric delivery cost of service with the benefit of the full amount of electric late payment revenue, including the over half related to power supply, rather than just the portion related to delivery service. ","Finally, the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers recommended limiting the common equity ratio of 50%, rather than the higher amount in our filling. We strongly believe that this proposed adjustment is unjustified. The ICC administrative law judges are expected to issue their proposed order in this case in August, with an ICC decision expected in late September and new rates to be effective in October, 2012. ","Turning now to page 16, in April, Ameren Illinois made its first annual electric delivery formula rate update filling. Again, while the outcome of this update case will establish the level of rates charged to customers beginning in January, 2013, full-year 2013 electric delivery earnings will reflect a true-up for 2013 rate base, actual cost of service and formula return on equity, as well as historical ICC ratemaking adjustment. As updated in July, this filing calls for an incremental $16 million annual rate decrease in addition to our updated request in the initial formula rate case that I just discussed. The reduction in rates beyond those filed in the initial case primarily reflects lower rate base and return on equity. The lower rate base in this filing, compared to the amount we supported in the initial case, primarily reflects the incorporation of 2011 accumulated deferred income taxes including bonus depreciation. ","The ICC staff and other interveners have filed their initial recommendations in the update case. Details of their positions are outlined at the bottom of page 16 and on page 17. The advocated incremental rate decreases that range from $12 to 23 million more than our proposed $16 million rate reduction. Their arguments were along the same lines they put forward in the initial formula rate case. Further, the ICC staff argued that the equity ratio should be limited to 51%, which reduced the revenue requirement by 4 million. In addition, the Attorney General of the Citizens Utility Board argued that the revenue requirements should be reduced by 5 million and 3 million respectively, to reflect the impact on deferred taxes of the 2011 change to the Illinois corporate income tax rate. ","The ICC administrative law judges are expected to issue their proposed order in this case by early November, with an ICC decision expected in December and new rates to be effective in January, 2013. ","Moving now to page 18, in an update on our pending Missouri electric rate case. We have requested a $376 million increase, with 273 million of this related to non-fuel costs. In addition, we are seeking approval of a new two-way storm cost tracking mechanism, and a new plant-in-service accounting proposal, as Tom has already discussed. ","Finally, the pending rate request includes the revenue requirement of Ameren Missouri\u2019s new and expanded energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act, or MEEIA. On page 19, we summarize the Missouri PSC staff\u2019s recent recommendations in the pending electric rate case based on our calculation. The staff recommended a $210 million increase, which included $121 million for higher net base fuel costs. The staff\u2019s net base fuel costs were $18 million more than Ameren Missouri\u2019s request, reflecting updated costs since our initial filing in February. The staff\u2019s recommended a non-fuel revenue increase of 89 million, which was $184 million less than our request. The primary driver of this $184 million difference was the staff\u2019s recommendation of a 9% return on equity, versus our 10.75% request, which accounted for $98 million. ","On this page, we list other key drivers of this difference, such as the exclusion of property tax increases for 2012 over the actual amount paid in 2011, the staff\u2019s recommendation that all of the Entergy purchase power refund be credited back to customers over three years, the rejection of a weather normalization adjustment, a lower rate base number primarily due to lower working capital and a recommendation that we not recover 2011 voluntary separation costs, as well as a number of other adjustments. ","Turning now to page 20, in other rate case issues, the staff\u2019s revenue recommendation incorporated $80 million related to the energy efficiency settlement that was ruled on by the MPSC yesterday. Also, the staff supported continuation of the pension\/OPEB vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism. However, the staff called for changing the FAC sharing mechanism to an 85\/15 split rather than the 95\/5 split currently in effect. This change in the sharing percentages is similar to what the staff has recommended in past rate cases. Finally, the staff recommended that the Missouri PSC reject our storm cost tracking mechanism and plant in-service accounting proposal. ","On page 21, we outline the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumer group\u2019s recommended reductions to our rate request. As you can see, their positions are similar to those of the Missouri PSC staff, though they recommend adoption of a slightly higher return on equity than the staff, at 9.3%. ","Page 22 completes our discussion of the pending electric rate case in Missouri. The Office of Public Counsel made several recommendations in the case, and we note them on this page. Missouri PSC is scheduled to hold a hearing in the case beginning in late September, and continuing through mid-October, with a decision expected in December, 2012, and new rates to be effective in January, 2013. ","Moving now to page 23, here we provide an update on our 2012 through 2014 [inaudible] power sales and hedges for our merchant generation business. Before we move to the updated hedge numbers, at the top of the page we indicate that expected 2012 merchant generation is now expected to be approximately 26.5 million MWh as of mid-2012. This is up approximately 1 million MWh from the estimate we shared with you on our May call, and it reflects increased generation due to the warmer-than-normal summer weather, driving higher spot power prices and increased utilization of gas-fired generation assets. You will also note that for 2012, we have hedged an amount greater than our expected generation, approximately 28 million MWh, and this amount is hedged at an average price of $43 per MWh. The approximately 1.5 million MWh of hedging in excess of expected generation, we expect it to be settled on a profitable basis using purchase power or additional generation to the extent power prices improve. ","Moving to 2013, we have now hedged approximately 22.5 million MWh at an average price of $37 per MWh. Further, for 2014, we have now hedged approximately 12.5 MWh at an average price of $38 per MWh. ","Finally, turning to page 24, here we update our merchant generation segment\u2019s fuel and related transportation hedges. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 25 million MWh at $24 per MWh, unchanged from what we communicated to you on the May call. For 2013, we have now hedged approximately 22 million MWh at about $23.50 per MWh, approximately $1 per MWh less than the number we provided in May. For 2014, we have now hedged approximately 14 million MWh at about $23.50 per MWh, also approximately $1 per MWh less than the number we shared with you in May. ","This completes our prepared remarks. ","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  ","Our first question is from the line of Steven Berg \u2013 Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Berg \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Good Morning.  Just wanted to touch on the FERC quarter, regarding the distributed power purchase agreement.  Are there any ongoing impacts to earnings that we should be thinking about, or this more of a onetime item for this quarter?","Thomas Voss","","Yes Steven, no there aren\u2019t any ongoing impacts associated with that. You know the $0.07 gain we had, is their reversal of some negative impacts that we had in prior years as a result of the (inaudible) charges.  Those negative impacts had been included in quarter earnings in the past, which is why we reflected this gain in quarter earnings.  That said, we now have a fuel adjustment clause in place in Missouri, and there\u2019re not ongoing impacts from this settlement.","Steven Berg \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. And then switching gears to MISO capacity. What are the next steps that we should be thinking about, or further steps to come post the third quarter?","Thomas Voss","I think the thing we\u2019re really focused on is this capacity portability issue.  And I think the next steps are for, you know, in accordance with the FERC ruling for MISO and PJM double discussion about some of the barriers to portability, as well as other issues that they have.  And then we and other parties will be filing comments with FERC regarding the portability issues.  So those are the ongoing things to watch for.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates. Please state your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good Morning, how are you?","Thomas Voss","","Good, thank you, how are you?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","All right.  The Illinois pollution deferral, you know, regulatory deferral that you\u2019re asking for in terms of implementation, how should we think about the impact of that on your plans, where they stand now I guess due to this issue.  There was a press report, I think yesterday, that there was a potential plant closures, et cetera if this wasn\u2019t deferred, and I wanted to get some census to where things stand?","Thomas Voss","Sure Paul. I think what you\u2019d be seeing in the press reports would be consistent with things we\u2019ve talked about on our past couple of calls. Obviously earlier this year as a result of the drop in power prices amongst other things, we decelerated construction of the (Newton Scrubber) Project.  We talked about the fact that, you know, one of the obstacles we had was the Illinois ","Multi Pollutant Standard and the racket down in terms of So2 emissions. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","I understand, I don\u2019t mean to make you go over that, I apologies. What I was trying to figure out was, if you were to get this, would this make things \u2013 I mean, in other words we should be under - the guidance in your forecast and everything are under the expectation that we don\u2019t have a change, is that correct?  And if I guess you did get the change, how might that change things?  Do you follow what I\u2019m saying?  Am I understanding it correctly?","Thomas Voss","I guess so, but you know there\u2019s not, I\u2019d say an immediate near term impact.  As we look out, you know, we\u2019re concerned about that ratchet down out in 2015. And to the extent that release isn\u2019t granted by the pollution control board, you know, and the Newton Scrubber, is not reaccelerated, then we do face the prospect of plant closures as discussed in our prepared remarks. So, you know, this is really an impact when we look out to that 2015 timeframe.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","And then, with respect to guidance, I gather, if I understand this correctly, it\u2019s because of the FERC order and because of normal weather in the second quarter, that you guys are raising the guidance? Is that correct?","Thomas Voss","Yes, those were some of the things that we had. You may recall Paul that after the first quarter, we actually lowered our guidance from our regulated entities by about $0.05 on either end of the range, and that\u2019s because in the first quarter we had about $0.10 of negative impact from weather, and so we lowered the guidance $0.05.  We\u2019ve seen an improvement in the weather situation, we\u2019re still down year-to-date by about $0.03 on a net basis versus normal. But we did see some positive impact in the second quarter from weather. And we also had the, as you noted, the positive FERC ruling.  Those things allowed us to move the guidance back up $0.05 to where we started the year for the regulated entities. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Julian Dumoulin \u2013 Smith \u2013 UBS. Please state your question.","Julian Dumoulin \u2013 Smith \u2013 UBS","","Hi, Good Morning.","Thomas Voss","Good Morning, Julian.","Julian Dumoulin \u2013 Smith \u2013 UBS","","First on the treasuries and the Illinois (formulate grates).  I noticed that you mentioned 3% here. Is that still using the blue chip average?  And then secondly, did that have sort of market-to-market impact in the second quarter, and what was that?  I apologize if I missed that in your prepared remarks.","Martin Lyons","","That\u2019s fine. Julian the 3% it reflect the actual experience in terms of (inaudible) for the first half of the year, as well as, you know, blue chip forecasting as of July. So, it\u2019s really the average for the year, which is what\u2019s included in the ROE. So, that 3% is what\u2019s baked into the guidance.","In terms of a way to think about that, about every 10 basis points or so, is about a half cent per share. So about a 30 basis point move is probably a penny and a half to two cents when you\u2019re thinking about the impact of something like that overall.  I wouldn\u2019t say there was a mark-to market the regulatory asset that we recorded at the end of the first quarter, was unchanged at the end of the second quarter as it related to that business.   ","Julian Dumoulin \u2013 Smith \u2013 UBS"," ","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of John Hansen -  Prestigious Advisors.

Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hey, guys congrats on a good quarter, good first half of the year.  On Illinois, Marty, just want to make sure I followed the rate base level declined from 2012 in your filing the 2013 little bit over right around $100 to $120 somewhat million dollars.  Can you just walk us through the (Pumaton Takes) meaning net capital additions minus normal course depreciation and then minus bonus depreciation, just so we can kind of think through the give and take, and then think about how this impacts post 2013?","Martin Lyons","","Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 Michael, I don\u2019t have a full reconciliation to walk you through, maybe something you can follow up with Doug after the call.  But you highlighted one of the drivers for that decrease.  The biggest is really that bonus depreciation, which has been included.  And of course that\u2019s been reflected in the guidance. I think what you\u2019ve seen in some of these cases that we have pending, is folks arguing that the accumulated depreciation should be included in the rate base. And certainly for this year in terms of the way we\u2019ve been broadcasting out earnings and forecasting our rate base, we\u2019ve included the deferred tax update from bonus depreciation in there, so that\u2019s the big driver.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Bishop \u2013 Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Bishop \u2013 Morningstar","","Hi, Good Morning.  Actually I have a clarification question on the FAC ordered.  If I understand correctly you took $18 million charge in 2011, no charge (inaudible), and then you reversed the charge in 2013 paying (inaudible)? Is that correct?","Thomas Voss","That could be, and I don\u2019t want to speculate on the outcome in \u201913, but yes, we took a charge last year of about $0.05, as noted on the call there\u2019s still about $25 or $26 million pending before the Reserved Public Service Commission that we expect them to rule on later this year. And then we\u2019ll  see how these court appeals play out. Obviously we took a charge because of the \u2013 last year, because of the commissions decision, and of course we flowed those monies back through the FAC. If at some point that commission decision is reversed one way or another, and ultimately we\u2019re able to collect those monies, at that point, it would become a gain.","Andy Bishop \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks so much.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Fallon \u2013 SIR Capital. Please state your question.","Kevin Fallon \u2013 SIR Capital","","Good Morning. A question for you, within your 2012 earnings guidance of $225 to $255, what is the amount of parent company drag when you\u2019re not allocating, non-recourse debt, interest expense related to that?","Martin Lyons","","You know, I don\u2019t know what the parent company drag is.  Typically what we\u2019ve done with our debt for the most part is allocated those costs out.  So, you know the parent company debt that exist, you know, the $425 million of debt, you know, for the most part those interest charges actually get allocated out to the merchant segment, and (inaudible) supporting that merchant segment. So, while the $425 is an obligation of Ameren Corporation, the debt is being seen as supporting capital expenditures made at the merchant segment over time.  Primarily, I shouldn\u2019t say primarily, really a AERG, which is a non-registrant, so we allocate those interests costs out to that segment.","Kevin Fallon \u2013 SIR Capital","But there\u2019s a much larger component of non-recourse that you also book within the Merchant Generation section, that would go away if you walked away from those businesses.  I\u2019m just trying to understand, if you separated from the Merchant Generation Businesses, one of the ongoing expense that you would have at the holding company level to offset against the regulated utilities?","Thomas Voss","","In terms of the debt, there\u2019s $825 million dollars or so of debt, at Ameren Energy Generating that is non-recourse debt.  That interest expense is allocated to Ameren energy Generating and AER, and then there\u2019s the other $425 up at Ameren Corp. and again that\u2019s an Ameren Corp. obligation and the interest expense is allocated down to that segment, Ameren Energy Resources.","Kevin Fallon \u2013 SIR Capital","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from David Paz with Bank of America, please state your question.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning.","Thomas Voss"," ","Good morning, David.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","","I was just wondering, following the agreement on MEEIA, what are the prospects of settlement in your ending Missouri rate case?","Thomas Voss","","Yes, David, I think I will maybe Warner Bax to take that one.","Warner Bax","","David, how are you doing?","","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","","Good morning, how are you doing?","Warner Bax","","I\u2019m terrific, thanks.  With regards to the settlement \u2013 I mean, as you know, we\u2019ve in the last several rate cases, we have not really come together in a comprehensive basis to settle the entire rate case, and that\u2019s due to several reasons \u2013 largely due to the fact that we have several parts of those cases, and certainly several issues to resolve.  But historically, we have been able to take several issues and resolve those in a partial settlement, and then take ultimately fewer issues to the commission.  Having said all of those things, certainly, if the prospects or settlements are always there so that the discussions be fruitful, and if they are fruitful, we would be happy to engage in those discussions there, if you can find something that makes sense.  So, I can\u2019t predict the outcome, but certainly if the opportunity is right, if it make sense for us, then we will move forward with that.  ","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Great, and just one question regarding your merger statement, what price level, Marty, are you looking for that you would need to avoid mob falling, the two of the three un-scrubbed core plant?","Martin Lyons","","You know, David, there\u2019s not, I would say, a specific price level of the words that I point to that, you know, would cause us to avoid them \u2013 and I think what you\u2019re really asking is there a certain price level in which the, you know, Newton Scrubber would be, you know, we accelerated, and you know, consistent, and then what we said on prior calls, you know, I think that we \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve estimated that if we reaccelerated that we would probably need something like 20 or 24 months of construction time to have that scrubber in service.  So, we continue to have some time to watch how things develop, but it\u2019s not just power prices \u2013 certainly watch power prices \u2013 I think of power, I guess you could say I think of energy, and I think of capacity because we are watching energy prices, capacity prices, development in terms of, you know, federal and environmental regulations, in the likes of \u2013 you know, there will be host of factors, but I can\u2019t point to a specific price that would be toward the threshold.  ","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates, please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","I just wanted to follow up so I understood the guidance.  It look like there\u2019s about seven cents of extra weather in the second quarter, and seven cents associated with the \u2013 seven cents of the weather, and seven tenths of [inaudible] fourteen then, and you mentioned on how you readjusted your number previously.  Is there anything that we should be thinking about that would lower the number so that we only have the five cents increasing guidance, or is there something \u2013 or are you guys just being conservative?","Thomas Voss","","So, yes, you are right and the numbers that you gave out are right, the Q2 weather versus normal was about a plus seven cents, and then the FERC agreement was another, you know, seven cents, but you are absolutely right.  I think in terms of, again, why five cents, I think that again, we are still bond weather wise because we had about a ten cent drag in the first quarter.  We only reduce the regulated guidance by about five cents \u2013 you know, we picked up seven cents of that, yes, in the second quarter, but we are still down net three cents a-year-to-date due to weather.  If that\u2019s on a prior call, we \u2013 we\u2019ve had about three basis point drop in the ROEs in Illinois, which again, as I said earlier, there\u2019s probably a penny-and-a-half to what two cents of earnings, and then I think one other thing, Paul, that we mentioned on the call is that, you know, we strip out weather \u2013 you know, we\u2019re seeing pretty flat, low growth in terms of residential, commercial year-to-date.  We did, at the beginning of the year, and frankly, continue to expect as we look to the second half of the year to see, to see some growth in those categories, year-to-date we haven\u2019t seen any.  Now, weather normalization is obviously, say not an exact science, with that pretty good extremes in both in  terms of the winter months and the spring summer months year-to-date, and so, sometimes those can cause variations, but we are seeing things pretty flat year-to-date.  So, those are some of the factors \u2013 the other thing that I would say though, Paul, what we mentioned is that, you know, the July weather has been extremely warm, and continues to be extremely warm, even this week, and none of the impacts of that favorable weather in July have been reflected in the guidance that we have provided. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","That\u2019s great, just one other \u2013 that leads me to my second question, which is, are you guys having any new peaks?  Have you found any change in peak demand?  You mentioned the [inaudible] kind of flattish, and I think that is \u2013 well, a lot of people\u2019s, actually, are even down where they are normalized.  But just in terms of \u2013 you had measly hot weather I think in the mid-west, at least it looked like it was, for me [inaudible] \u2013 what do you guys think of in terms of peak demand?","Thomas Voss","","Yes, you know, I should have brought some exact datas, but I don\u2019t.  I can tell you that while we have, you know \u2013 you know, had some very strong demands, I think we\u2019re still down for some of the peaks that we saw a couple of years ago, but I won\u2019t \u2013 and maybe then I will ask somebody else to do it, to comment on that quickly.","Maurine Barkoski","","This is Maurine Barkoski.  Transmission system basis, we did set a new all-time peak on July the 25th, of a \u2013 I forget the exact number, but I think it was 18,588 megawatts, and based on the two individual companies, Ameren Illinois, did set a new all-time peak on that same day, Ameren Missouri has not yet exceeded it\u2019s all-time peak which was in 2007.

With the sharing that had taken place yesterday, can you \u2013 what\u2019s the next step here?  Is there another hearing date, or is the next thing we will hear is the ruling coming out of court?","Thomas Voss","","Yes, no, there \u2013 you know, there won\u2019t be another hearing set, and we, basically, will expect to see a decision by the pollution control board deadline September the 20th.","Ryan Tabio \u2013 Futcher and Company","Have they given you any \u2013 or have you gotten any guidance, or input on what their major focus is?  You\u2019ve mentioned all the major parties and their different views, but have they given you any idea what they are focused on in terms of making their decision?","Thomas Voss","","No, the \u2013 you know, yesterday, I think the public hearing was well attended, all five of the members of the pollution control board were in attendance.  I think they were \u2013 they were very attentive, and I think they heard, you know, from folks that spoke, I would say, on behalf of our competition, you know, folks that are located in our service territories that, you know, would \u2013 that spoke of the potential economic and personal impact of the variance, and of course there were a citizen\u2019s group there who spoke in opposition.  So, you know, what they \u2013 with the police and the control board there to do again is to balance both environmental concerns with economic concerns, and you know, they heard testimonies on both sides.  You know, ultimately, really the only parties to this to proceeding are ourselves and the IEPA that noted on our call, the IEPA has taken a neutral stance on this, and sees our petition as being environmentally beneficial, and that is our view as well, and so, we look to pollution control board again to balance the, you know, the economics with the environmental mandate.","Ryan Tabio \u2013 Futcher and Company","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is a follow up from Julian Dumoulin-Smith of UBS, please state your question.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, just a few follow ups on the [inaudible] side of the equation. First, as you just eluded to for the net positive benefits \u2013 I know it\u2019s IEPA here, but kind of just wanted to get a sense of how is it actually a net positive, is it just because you\u2019re accelerating some of the reductions from 2015 forward, and that sort of off net would have happened in the back half of the [inaudible] \u2013 [inaudible] what you think about it?","Ryan Tabio \u2013 Futcher and Company","","Yes, that is a good way of think about it, Julian.","","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","All right, and then secondly, on capacity affordability, what could this eventually mean, just trying to think about an ideal scenario, is this all of your capacity, partial \u2013 you know, is this just about getting some transfer right that is recognized \u2013 there are a number of different iterations that could be coming out of this, but I just wanted to get your state.","Ryan Tabio \u2013 Futcher and Company","","I think that is probably true, there probably are a number of different iterations that could come out of it, but certainly, I think that to the extent that, you know, we have capacity, and we\u2019ve got, you know, there\u2019s available transmission to get, you know, out of MISO, and into PJM \u2013 you know, we think we should be able to sell that capacity into PJM, whether that\u2019s the percentage of our fleet, ultimately it would be available to do that \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t know off hand.  I think it could be a number of, as you said, a number of outcomes there.","Doug Fischer","","Operator, this Doug Fischer, we have time for one more question.  ","Operator","","That question is coming from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hey, Marty, an easy one here, can you just walk us through in the first half of 2012, what are items that are still included in ongoing [inaudible], but may not actually happen until next year, meaning, kind of like the FERC item, the seven cent benefit from the FERC item that is ongoing EPS?  I\u2019m just trying to think about whether it\u2019s storm related, or anything else that is left for accounting lease and ongoing EPS, but may not actually be reoccurring 12 months from now.","Martin Lyons","","Yes, sure, Michael.  I think that we tried to list the major ones on, you know, slide three, and I guess those are mostly related to Q2, and maybe I should focus you back on our Q1 slide as well \u2013 we had a similar slide for Q1, but you do see, you know, the third quarter there, we had the absence of the fact charge from last year, and the storm costs from last year.  As I recall from the first quarter too though, we picked up a couple of cents of impact in Ameren Illinois because of contributions that we made at the start of the Illinois rate file.  So, again, I just want to point you back to those first quarter slides, I think we have negative in the first quarter that would not be repeating again next year.  And then, I think as you, as you look to next year, you know, I think some of the things to think about as just the \u2013 you\u2019ll have the resolution in the Missouri rate case later this year, next year we will have a calloway outage, where there was not calloway outage this year.  Those will be some of the drivers as well as what happens with 30 year treasuries, and it affects Illinois, and in our continuing to deploy capitals that we\u2019ve laid out.

","Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to earnings of $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Year-over-year increase was driven by higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales primarily due to extremely warm early summer temperatures compared to near-normal temperatures in the year-ago period. In addition, the comparison benefited from earnings on increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. ","These favorable factors were partially offset by higher Ameren Missouri other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily reflecting higher-than-normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outage. Martin will discuss and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. We continue to focus on executing our strategic plan, which includes operating our businesses safely while strategically investing capital to serve our customers, achieving constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceeding, and exercising discipline cost management. ","As a result of higher electric sales due to the extremely warm weather and solid execution of our strategy, we've raised our 2018 guidance range to $3.15 per share to $3.35, up from our prior range of $2.95 per share to $3.15 per share. ","Moving now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. That plan is expected to continue to result in strong, long-term investment and earnings growth. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The results of that strategy has been our multi-year focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in jurisdictions that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery.","I am very pleased to say that with the recent enactment of constructive legislation in Missouri through Senate Bill 564, all four of our business segments now have constructive regulatory frameworks under which we can allocate significant amounts of capital to support much-needed investment with the benefit of our customers and the communities that we serve.","I will cover the Missouri legislation in more detail in a moment. Of course, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy is achieving constructive outcomes in regulatory proceedings. As Martin will cover in more detail later, we have been very busy in Illinois in managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings. We have been making solid progress and settling important issues with key stakeholders including an agreement in late July with the ICC staff on all issues in our pending natural gas distribution rate review.","We expect final decisions from the ICC in these proceedings later this year. In Missouri, we recently reached a settlement with all parties to reduce electric rates associated with passing to customers, savings from the lower federal income tax rate and the Missouri Public Service Commission subsequently approved a settlement. Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains a relentless focus on continuous improvement, and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable and keep -- and returns closed to allow returns in all of our jurisdictions.","Turning now to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the years, we have been successful in executing this element of our strategy through extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions. I am please to report that these efforts paid off again in the second quarter when the Missouri legislature passed Senate Bill 564 with strong bipartisan support in both chambers, and which was later signed by the governor.","I view the passes of Senate Bill 564 as a win-win for our shareholders, our customers and the entire state of Missouri just as I did with the passage of grid modernization legislation in Illinois several years ago. Notably, this legislation enhances the Missouri regulatory framework to support investments in energy infrastructure, as well as cyber security and digital technologies, which benefits all stakeholders. In particular beginning later this month, Senate Bill 564 will improve our ability to earn a fair return on all qualifying capital investments made between rate cases by allowing us to defer for future recovery 85% of the depreciation expense and return on rate base later the plant placed in service between main cases.","This provision applies to all qualifying plant placed in service after August 28 including plant related to investments that we outlined during our year-end conference call in February. As a result, this change in the regulatory framework will now enable Ameren to move forward with approximately $1 billion in incremental investment through 2023 to modernize Missouri's electric grid including installation of smart meters and deployment of other advanced technologies. These investments are expected to be largely additive to the five-year capital expenditure plan we outlined in February.","For our shareholders, these incremental investments are expected to add to the already strong projected break base growth of 7% annually from 2018 to 2022 that we outlined in February. We are well under way and plan to produce significant capital projects and expect to provide an update to our capital investment, rate base and earnings growth plans either on our third quarter earnings conference call in November or during our year end conference call next February.","Senate Bill 564 will also deliver significant benefits to our customers. In fact, it already has. In particular, it is enabled Ameren to begin to flow back to customers the benefits of federal tax reform. Effective August 1st, customers received a 6.1% rate reduction due to tax reform. Customers also wanted greater rate certainty in Senate Bill 564 delivers on this as well. Under the legislation, electric rates are frozen until April 1st, 2022 and average overall rate increases are capped at 2.85% compounded annually through 2023.","We believe that we will be able to stay under this rate cap as we work to effectively manage costs throughout our business, including those associated with coal and related transportation costs, operations and maintenance, taxes and financing costs. Importantly, customers want an electric grid that is more reliable and secure, and they want to have a greater ability to manage their energy costs. The incremental $1 billion of investment I described earlier is targeted at projects that will deliver on all these fronts. Of course, Senate Bill 564 maintains continued strong Missouri PSC oversight and consumer protections.","For the State of Missouri, this in criminal investment will clearly create good-paying jobs just as our incremental investment in Illinois has. In addition, this legislation includes new and meaningful economic development incentives for certain incremental electric sales to large energy users. These tools will help attract new companies to the state, as well as enable existing companies to expand ,all of which will drive economic growth and give us the ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger sales base over time. Bottom line is that Senate Bill 564 is a win-win for all stakeholders.","Moving now to Page 7 for an update on our wind generation investment plans, which is directly tied to the third pillar of our strategy, grading and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders? We continue to make progress on Ameren Missouri's proposed investment and at least 700 megawatts or approximately $1 billion of wind generation to achieve compliance with Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. We entered into an agreement with Terra- Gen to acquire after construction a 400 megawatt wind farm to be located in Northeast Missouri, the largest ever in the state. ","Subsequently in late May, we filed for certificate of convenience and necessity with the Missouri PSC. This filing included a request to use the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism. The rider that provides cost recovery between late cases. A decision on this CCN request is expected by January 2019. Further, we continue to hold discussions with other wind developers and expect to file for certificates of convenience and necessity for ownership of the balance of our wind generation needs later this year. And finally Regional Transmission Organization Interconnection studies are underway for all sites under consideration.","We look forward to execute in this important component of Ameren Missouri's integrated resource plan because we believe that will deliver clear benefits to our customers, the environment and the communities we serve. ","Turning now to Page 8. In February, we roll forward a five-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 5% to 7% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2017 through 2022 period, using 2017 core earnings per share as a base. This earnings growth outlook was primarily driven by expected 7% compound annual rate base growth over the same period. Importantly, our five-year rate based growth projections do not include approximately $ 1 billion of incremental annual Missouri capital expenditures through 2023 associated with the enactment of Senate Bill 564, or the potential incremental Ameren Missouri investment of approximately $1 billion of wind generation by 2020.","These incremental investments are expected to be largely additive to Ameren's overall five-year plan outlined in February.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter. Our operations were solid, was contributed to improved reliability and customer satisfaction. Our earnings were strong, and we increased our 2018 earnings guidance. We entered into an agreement to acquire after construction a 400 megawatt wind farm which is the largest in the State of Missouri and will help us continue to diversify our generation portfolio. Further, we achieved a major strategic milestone with the passage of Constructive Legislation in Missouri, which we expect will strengthen our already strong infrastructure investment plans, and rate based growth outlook.","Simply put, we're doing what we said we would do. We are executing on our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which is driving our strong, long-term earnings growth outlook. And when combined with our solid dividend yield which is currently about 3%, we believe results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. The bottom line is that we are delivering superior long-term benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Lyons","Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, today we reported second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to earnings of $0.79 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase are highlighted by segments on this page. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment and also the largest driver of year-over-year earnings improvement reported an increase of $0.20 per share, up from $0.49 per share in 2017 to $0.69 per share in 2018.","As Warner mentioned, this improvement was driven by higher electric retail sales primarily due to near record temperatures compared to near normal temperatures experienced in the year ago period. For additional perspective, based on data for St. Louis going back to the late 1800s, April was the fourth coldest, May the hottest in June, the eighth hottest on record. Bottom line, this was quite an unusual quarter for weather. This favorable impact of higher sales was partially offset by an expected increase in other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily reflecting higher than normal scheduled non nuclear plant outages.","Turning to the other segments. Earnings for Ameren Transmission were up slightly reflecting increased infrastructure investments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were comparable as increased investment qualifying for the infrastructure rider was offset by a partial reversal of the first quarter 2018 federal income tax rate benefit. Finally, earnings for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were also comparable as increased investments in infrastructure contributed about $0.01 per share but this was offset by higher than normal non recoverable costs.","In summary, we had a strong second quarter that contributed to increased first-half earnings across each of our four operating segments. Details on the year-to-date results are provided in the appendix of this presentation. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first six months of this year, compared to the first six months of last year. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased 2% excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under MEEIA. We exclude MEEIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.","Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased 1%. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter the cause do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.","Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2018 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we raised our 2018 guidance range to $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share, up from our prior range of $2.95 per share to $3.15 per share. This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page. These considerations are largely self explanatory and consistent with the 2018 earnings drivers and assumptions initially discussed on our February earnings call.","I would like to note the last item on this page. As we pass to customers the benefit of the lower federal tax rate, we expect a difference between the recognition of revenue and income tax expense to cause quarterly variations for the balance of this year. However, this was not expected to impact full-year results. ","Moving now to page 12 for discussion of select regulatory matters. For Ameren Transmission, there has been no change in the status of the second complaint case pending at the FERC that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO Transmission owners. We continue to expect that the FERC commissioners will consider the court ruling in the New England ROE case, as well as the MISO Transmission owners' motion to dismiss the second MISO ROE complaint case, as both may influence the future MISO allowed ROE.","Moving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois's formula rate making, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In late June, the IC staff issued its recommendation and it was comparable to Ameren Illinois request. A decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2019.","Moving to page 13 and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas regulatory matters. Earlier this year, we filed with the ICC for an annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2019 future test year. In late July, we updated our request to incorporate an agreement with the ICC staff on all issues including a 9.87 % ROE and 50% equity ratio and $1.6 billion of rate base. A decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2019.","Turning now to Missouri regulatory matters. As Warner mentioned, in July pursuant to Senate bill 564, the Missouri PSC approved passing the savings from the lower federal income tax rate to customers effective August 1st. This reduced customer rates 6.1% or $167 million annually and includes the flow back of excess deferred income taxes. In addition, consistent with the Missouri PSC order, we have accrued $47 million as of June 30th, 2018 representing tax benefits realized year-to-date, which will be flowed to customers following our next rate review.","Recall that our earnings guidance for 2018 assumed the benefits of federal tax reform would be fully passed on to customers. ","Finally, turning to page 14, I'll summarize. We are on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2018 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look over the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by a rate based growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. The combination of our growth outlook and attractive dividend yield provides total shareholder return potential that we believe compares very favorably to our peers.","Finally, I'd like to share one last point of recognition. After a 37-year career both covering Ameren and other utilities as an Investment Analyst or as our Senior Director of Investor Relations, Doug Fisher is retiring effective mid-august. I know Doug has many friends in the investment community as he does here at Ameren as a result of his hard work, knowledge, dedication and personality. I know that I am going to personally miss working closely with Doug, which I've enjoyed for these past 10 years. I would like to thank him and wish him, Cindy and his family well in the next chapter of his life. Thanks Doug.","With that I'd like to let you know that Andrew Kirk, our new Director of Investor Relations will be leading our efforts in this important area going forward. Andrew has been with Ameren for 17 years including over four years in Investor Relations, and he'll be a great asset along with our newest IR team member Megan McPhail. Megan has been with Ameren for 10 years supporting our corporate modeling and treasury groups.","I will now turn it back over to Warner for some closing remarks.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Marty. Look, I simply want to echo Marty's comments about Doug. As many of you know for decades, literally decades that was a respected industry analyst. He was always thoughtful, always prepared and certainly always steady. And that we're very fortunate that Doug join the Ameren team some 10 years ago. Now and he continued to be that thoughtful and respected voice to me, Marty and certainly to those in the investor community. And frankly in so doing meaningfully enhanced our investor relations program.","So, Doug, thank you for your contributions to our company and our industry. You will certainly be missed. So in closing, I wish you Doug and your family the very best in health and happiness in your retirement. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will not invite questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Smith","Hey, good morning, everyone. Good. Well I want to echo the last two comments here, and I want to also send my congratulations to Doug. Andrew you guys have been great. Thank you very much and all the best. So and perhaps just to kick it off with a quick question here if I can. In terms of the legislation and what it means in Missouri just talking about sort of the meat and potatoes of lag expectations. Can you talk about the depreciation and deferral accounting and just to what extent, a; this could eventually change your capital budget spending sort of independent of the two factors that are out there that are not reflected. And then secondly, just as you think about sort of structural expectations particularly given a longer period in between the next rate case, how do you think about ROE lag over the next few years as well in Missouri? ","Warner Baxter","Thanks. Martin Lyons, you perhaps take that talk about some of the structural things around SB564 and then perhaps Michael Moehn, the president of our Missouri operations can sort of chime in. Marty?","Martin Lyons","Yes, sure, Julien. Appreciate the question. The biggest impact I would say of Senate Bill 564 over the next several years is going to be our expectation of deploying about a $1 billion of additional capital in a relative to the capital expenditure plan we put forward in December, and \/or Fed announced in February. The driver of that really is the ability to defer depreciation and return on those projects that go into service in between rate cases.","When I say defer, it's more specifically about 85% is 85% of those impacts on depreciation and return over time. So that should really help us to mitigate the impact we've had on regulatory lag of capital expenditures. As Warner mentioned in his talking points that accounting in that regulatory treatment applies to the vast majority of our capital expenditures not just the incremental billion as we move forward. So look, we're not-- giving specific guidance here today on the future as we roll those capital expenditures, and additional capital expenditures associated with wind into our longer-term capital expenditure plans, or rate based plans.","We'll update our overall earnings growth guidance. I will tell you that key part of our strategy is to continuously improve our operating performance, and earn close to our allowed returns that will continue to be sort of a hallmark of our plans going forward is to work to be able to deploy the incremental capital while still earning close to our allowed returns. In terms of rate cases, we do have a moratorium for some time and then we'll begin to have the opportunity to have rate reviews going forward. ","The earliest we can file our next rate case is in May of 2019, with rates going into effect in April of 2020. And the latest we can file our next rate review is May of 2020, with rates then going into effect after an 11 month review process, and approximately April of 2021. So those are the next sort of the goalposts, if you will, for the timing of our next rate case.","Julien Smith","It just sounds -- just to clarify that, it sounds if you can earn your allowed returns through that perhaps extended period.","Martin Lyons","That's going to be our goal is turn very close to our allowed in the next period. Look, Senate Bill 564 to be clear is not formulaic rate making. There is still the impacts of things like O&M expense or variations in interest or other factors that could move earning up or down relative to the allowed return coming out of a rate review. So but as we've said many times, the things that 564 addressed, the depreciation, the return on investment. Those were the things that were a significant driver of regulatory lag as we deployed incremental capital.","So 564 is on point to address those things, and is going to allow us to deploy that incremental billion, but we'll still have to have financial discipline, strong financial management in order to continue to earn close to our allowed.","Warner Baxter","Which is certainly a key part of our strategy not a new one. It's one that we've been executing on. Michael, any final comments.","Michael Moehn","The only thing I was going to mention is I think we've said previously with respect to that $1 billion as a capital. If you think about it ratably over the next five years, and there going to be some variability in it but we're busy working to flush out what those plans are going to be over the next one in five years, and put that in front of the Commission.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. How are you? So congratulations, Doug. You must be excited. But, so I wanted to just follow-up on a few things. One was with respect to the Noranda start up, it's not Noranda anymore but the smelter, I think it's back to start up now again, is that correct?","Michael Moehn","It is. I think they're scheduled to start I believe two of the three pot lines and we are not really involved in that at this point. They've entered into an agreement with the municipal co-op down there to supply that power at this point.","Paul Patterson","Okay, fair enough. And then just sort of just a follow-up on all the activity that you mentioned and you mentioned of course that the $1 billion associated with the wind and the $1 billion associated with the wind the $1 billion associated with -- the other -- the grid mod is not in there. I was just wondering, are you thinking about -- are there any other opportunities that you guys are seeing, maybe, that we should maybe be thinking about? I know you guys are going to be updating the capital expense maybe the third or perhaps fourth quarter, but just sort of wondering if there's anything more we should be thinking about their?","Warner Baxter","So, Paul, this is Warner. As you step back I think our rate base growth is not just a five-year plan. We have a robust demand in the past, -- me to say, infrastructure plan beyond really through 2022 and it isn't just in Missouri. We've talked about good modernization there which is meaningful. We talked about renewable energy investments which too are meaningful, and it could be more in the future, but when you look at the investments that we still have in Illinois, now we're executing the grid modernization plan there, but we've talked in the past about the potential incremental investments we had to do in the gas business.","We continue to deploy capital there because there's need but also because there's a great regulatory framework over there. And of course in transmission, we look at not just the multi-value projects which we're executing very well, but look there are a number of projects that we have to continue to execute there in terms of just system expansion. You think about NERC requirements. So we look at our overall infrastructure pipeline. It's robust across all of our businesses, and so our objective is to not only execute on the projects that we have in front of us over the next five years, but also to create and capitalize and infrastructure pipeline opportunities in the future. That has been our focus and will continue to be.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just a clarification, I apologize, I didn't get it completely. The sales growth numbers, I think you said, in Missouri, weather-adjusted was 2% before the MEEIA. Can you just clarify a little bit of that? I apologize. I 'm just not picking up quick enough.","Martin Lyons","That's okay. Paul this is Marty. We talked about is in Missouri, the residential and commercial we're up about 2% excluding the energy efficiency programs under MEEIA. Industrial was also up about1.2%, and this is in the second quarter. Illinois residential and commercial customers were -- there sales were up about 1%. Industrial was up about 3% there. And we reminded folks in the prepared remarks of course in Illinois we have decoupling. So while sales were up and that's great it, there's no effect on earnings in Illinois because of the decoupling. So those are the statistics that we provided overall for the second quarter.","Paul Patterson","What do you make of the 2% though? I mean is that before energy efficiency? I am just wondering your energy efficiency efforts, I realize you can collect them or what have you but what would the impact be without it, I guess? Do you follow? What was the impact of it? Do you follow me in other words --? ","Martin Lyons ","We have to look back; my recollection is we're up maybe 0.5% or so excluding the MEEIA impact. So it's still up even including I should say the MEEIA impacts. And I think overall what I make of it is its good trends. We've been seeing on --those are all actually the numbers I gave I think Q2 those were all year-to-date numbers that I gave you. And if you look across all of that we were up for residential, commercial industrial in both states. And I think it reflects them of the good underlined data too. ","We've seen good growth in terms of residential and customer counts year-over-year in Missouri. Those are up about 0.8%. They're a little more flattish in Illinois, but seem good growth in those customer accounts in Missouri. Our unemployment it's been tracking well. We've seen job growth over the past year in both states. In Missouri --in our area in Missouri, the unemployment is around 3.6% versus nationally around 4% and in our service territory in Illinois its right about that national average, where we're sitting at about 4.1%. So I think the trend data and customer counts looks good and weather normalized sales looks good.","And I'd say overall, we feel like the economic conditions in both states are stable. I think going forward, Paul, we're still thinking more about flat in terms of the sales growth. These are nice trends year-to-date, but we'll continue to monitor things long-term. Our --for our longer-term planning purposes, we've been thinking more about flattish in terms of the sales growth because while we are seeing positive underlying economic data, we do have these energy efficiency plans and therefore net we expect about flat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with Exoduspoint Capital Management. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Levi","Hey, guys, good morning. I am doing well, congrats, another good quarter is racking it up, becoming like CMS and --, very impressive. And then, Doug, for you we spoke already so no other state, did a great job as always for 25 years, actually I know you can hit 25 years. ","Warner Baxter","Pretty amazing, it is pretty amazing.","Andrew Levi","Pretty scary, actually for all of us. ","Warner Baxter","We won't go into storytelling about Doug. Let us move on.","Andrew Levi","Yes. Anyway so back to the Q&A. Can we just timing-wise just to understand as far as the wind and as far as the grid mod relative to Missouri, new disclosures CapEx, growth rate guidance all that. When will that all be disclosed? Is that can be at EI or how should we think about that?","Warner Baxter","Marty, you want you to touch -- you hit on some of this in our talking points, but might you touch on some of the things we're thinking about either the third quarter or early next year. And then Michael perhaps you briefly touch on some of the things you're doing to prepare to move forward on those projects. So Marty?","Martin Lyons","Sure. As Warner just said, that we're thinking either at the earliest on our third quarter conference call which would obviously lead in the EI as you mentioned, or as we have done more traditionally on our year-end call which is in February. So that's the way to think about it. In terms of the spend in Missouri, the incremental $ 1billion for grid modernization that it would be expected to kick in beginning in 2019, and be fairly ratable but I'd say build some over the five-year period.","And so that's how we see that laying out as we mentioned on the call in terms of the wind, while we have filed a certificate of convenience and need request with the Commission for the first 400, we're still working with developers on the remainder. We expect to have those done and filed by the end of the year. And all of that planning and execution work will factor into our thoughts in terms of when we update our longer-term guidance. Michael any additional thoughts?","Michael Moehn","Yes. I think the only thing to add that in addition to what you said about the wind would just be around the grid modernization. So we have some filings that we are going to will put in front of the Commission early in 2019 that will lay out the $ 1 billion has to be in a great deal of detail for one year out, a little less detail for the subsequent four years, but we're very focused on that today and being able to tell the story and the benefits for our customers.","Warner Baxter","So Andy all those factors as Marty said will go into the overall timing, and so this is why we haven't made a specific choice, if we're ready to do it in November, we will do so, if not we will provide the update during our February conference call.","Andrew Levi","Okay and just to make sure that I understand what you were saying that your current kind of forecast the five to seven and everything that's in the handout doesn't -- doesn't include any of that\/","Warner Baxter","That's correct it. It does not include the $1 billion associated with grid modernization but a potential $ billion associated with the wind generation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Doug, I think obviously it goes without saying, you've been fantastic. You've been a great peer as well as superbly professional, and we'll miss you and I'll be jealous of all the free time you're going to have. My question is with regard to --well I --presumption that when you give us the updated capital expenditure forecast, you're also going to tell us how you're going to need to finance that spending, right. So is it right to assume a base case of sort of $0.50 of every dollar of incremental capital is funded -- needs to be funded with equity and the rest can be funded with utility subsidiary debt which is roughly equivalent to the cap structure or can you walk us through either credit metric, current credit metrics where they stand and how that will frame up the use of the balance sheet to fund the growth?","Martin Lyons","Yes, Greg, yes, this is Marty. As it relates to the credit metrics and where we stand there with S&P right now of course we're the BBB plus. They've set an FFO to debt threshold of 13%. They've got a positive outlook there. At Moody's, we've got BAA1 at Ameren overall and at Missouri, Illinois A3 FFO to debt threshold there for all of those entities at 19%. And we don't typically disclose our exact metrics in terms of where we're at, but it feel comfortable as we sit here today with our current plan that we'd be able to achieve metrics at or above those levels.","And we like the ratings we have today. As you know, we've worked hard to improve our business risk profile over time, and to maintain good credit metrics. And so we do like where they sit today. And as you also know when we updated our guidance at February which we had not a lot of capital expenditure plans but the incremental cash flows and rate base impacts of tax reform. We did decide at that time to begin to issue some equity under the dividend reinvestment, and employee benefit plans.","Really with the goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, 0maintaining good financial flexibility and good credit metrics. And those dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans are expected to generate anywhere from to $75 million to $100 million a year in equity proceeds. As you mentioned, when we update our capital expenditure outlook or rate based growth plans for the incremental grid modernization, and wind investments, at that point we will step back and take a look at our overall plans with respect to financing that and will be taken into account the things I just talked about.","Maintaining the strong balance sheet, credit metrics, credit ratings all of that. Thinking about what's prudent in terms of financing relative to those things. And then also making sure we think through how best to maximize shareholder value as we pursue putting those investments in to rate base and earning good returns for the shareholders.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So I should think about it more around --if I could theoretically come up with reasonably good estimate of what I think your current FFO to debt metrics are and assuming that they're at or above the targets that I put myself in your --put my Treasury hat on that I would look to manage to maintain those metrics whilst just trying to maximize the value for shareholders and build a financing plan that way.","Martin Lyons","I think you've exactly got it right. I mean I think from a finance treasury perspective we're balancing all of those things, making sure we've got good balance, good strong balance sheet, solid credit metrics relative to our existing ratings, and being thoughtful about how to position these things as we move through the regulatory process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning. I mostly just wanted to congratulate Doug and Andrew. Doug, I wish you many, many happy years of retirement. And Andrew very well-deserved promotion. I did have a couple questions though. I just --this is stepping I guess way back and just building a little bit on Greg's and Andy's question. I mean that the regulatory and legislative wins that you've had you clearly provides some incremental opportunities and I guess that could be thought of as tactically beneficial sort of a tactical win or it could be thought more of as a structural movement upward in your ability to grow your earnings power, grow your investment.","And with that a proportionate increase in kind of longer-term growth expectations. So I guess philosophically when you think about where you are now in terms of looking at your growth potential, do you think this is heading towards a structural shift upwards in your longer term growth potential? And is that something that you can address when you do give us that update?","Warner Baxter","So, Steven, this is Warner. Look, I don't know if you can call it -- whatever you want to call it, I called a significant strategic way, and it's a strategic win for shareholders, our customers and in the states that we operate in. So when I step back and I look at where we're at today we now have all four of the operating segments that we operate in with constructive regulatory frameworks. That support investment, important investment for the benefit of our customers, the communities that we serve and certainly our shareholders. And so as a result, we have said and we will put more capital to work in the state of Missouri just like we did in Illinois when they passed constructive legislation, and just like we had been in our transmission business when they have constructive jurisdictions there.","And just like we did in our Illinois Natural Gas Distribution businesses. So where you call that a structural up lifts or not I call it an uplift period and I think it's strategic. And I think it's a win-win as I said during my talking points really for all stakeholders. ","Stephen Byrd","Thanks. And then I'm thinking about your insulation against rising interest rates or ways to address that. Illinois's got a very efficient mechanism. Let's just assume for the moment that interest rates did rise significantly, did you just talk to potential ways to enhance the allowed return on equity outside of Illinois in terms of mechanisms? I know there's extended transmission process, but I'm trying to kind of think through other ways that could be sort of you could use that an offensive way in terms of readjusting upward the allowed ROE.","Warner Baxter","Steven, this is Warner. I'll start and then maybe Marty you can add. Certainly you point out rightfully so Illinois has a very unique and constructive mechanism to address a rising interest rate environment. It's one of the few like it in the country, and when they put that together it was to mitigate this risk but obviously these low interest rate environment customers in Illinois have benefited immensely. But it is a mechanism that obviously adjusts immediately which we think is terrific, it should the need arise. And of course, you think about the other jurisdictions where we have the ability to go in for rate cases, when we deem it appropriate.","And so while in Missouri we have a rate freeze through April of 2020, obviously, we respect that --will have to come in by 2021 and we have the ability to file rate cases when we believe it's appropriate. Just as we do in Illinois for our natural gas business to file rate cases. We have a forward test year there and so we can be mindful of those types of things to try and make sure that we match our cost of capital with changes in the interest rate environment. Transmission, a little bit different mechanism to get that, but we think too should the need arise we could go in there if interest rates rise sharply.","We can get there in a timely fashion to address those types of issues. So I think under our existing frameworks we have the ability to address that potential risk, and then as I said before with Illinois we have really a unique mechanism to do even better. Marty anything else to comment on.","Martin Lyons","No. I think I just note that as it relates to update in the rate cases, as we talked on the call about a settlement in our gas case in Illinois where we've agreed with the staff in terms of a settlement moving the ROE there up from 9.6 to 9.87. So there is that opportunity as we go through these regulatory rate reviews. I had also mentioned more on the cost side too. We've done a lot over the past several years to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment to refinance debt. And as we've been doing that it have been really pushing out the maturity terms and the average tenor of our financings to provide some assurance there in terms of the interest cost we see over time.","So I know that wasn't the exact point of your question. I think Warner answered your question head-on, but I thought I would add that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","Good morning. Congrats on good results and I just wanted to also add, thank you, Doug, for all your work and help during this time period. Marty can I just ask as you review your stuff for the update on the CapEx plan and can we expect that right now if I'm right the base of the CAGR is based on from 2017 to 2022, well now you have raised the guidance for I guess weather purposes but can we assume that you would update the base also when you provide --as we look forward or I'm just trying to better understand the parameter -- to change.","Martin Lyons","Sure, Ashar. No, yes, I think we would logically update the base and we'll decide what that will be. I mean you're right the current 5% to 7% compound annual EPS growth expectations that we have out there which are 2017 through 2022 or based off of a core EPS number in 2017 of 2.83. So as we roll forward our CapEx and rate based growth assumptions as we update our expectations on EPS growth, logically, we would establish a new base for that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fischer for any closing remarks.","Douglas Fischer ","Thank you. And thank you for participating in this call. And thank you to Warner and Marty for your kind remarks earlier. Thanks also to Andrew and his predecessor Matt there for their hard work and insight in helping execute Ameren's IR program over the last 10 ten years. I also want to especially thank you analyst analysts and investors for your friendship and for teaching me so much over the years.","I will miss interacting with you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Doug Fischer, Senior Director of IR for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Fischer. You may begin.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. I'm Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Tom Voss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet, and the webcast will be available for 1 year on our website at ameren.com. Further, this call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast. Redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.

Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, conditions, events and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

Marty will follow with more detailed discussions of first quarter 2013 financial results and financial and other matters. We will then open the call for questions. Now here's Tom who will start on Page 3 of the presentation.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced first quarter 2013 net income from continuing operations of $0.22 per share compared to first quarter 2012 net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. First quarter earnings from our rate-regulated utilities were in line with our expectations. Reflecting our March agreement to divest our merchant generation business to an affiliate of Dynegy, the results of this business are now classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. The increase in first quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations compared to first quarter 2012 reflected improved earnings from Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. Colder winter weather which drove higher electric and natural gas sales lines and new rates for Ameren Missouri electric and Ameren Illinois transmission service both effective in January 2013 were key drivers of the earnings improvement. The comparison also benefited from the absence in 2013 of a required donation that was made in 2012 associated with the implementation of formula-based electric delivery rates in Illinois that year. These favorable factors were partially offset by a reduction in weather normalized revenues recognized in this year's first quarter by Ameren Illinois under electric delivery formula ratemaking. In addition, nonfuel operations and maintenance expenses were higher at Ameren Missouri. Marty will provide more details on our earnings in a few minutes.","Moving to Page 4. Today, we also established 2013 earnings guidance for continuing operations in the range of $2 to $2.20 per share. The presentation of guidance on a continuing operations basis reflects the classification of the merchant generation business as discontinued operations in the first quarter. Also, this guidance incorporates approximately $0.20 per share of parent company and other costs, including certain costs that were previously allocated to the merchant generation business. We expect to reduce these parent company and other costs to $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2014 and to reduce them even further in 2015. This is expected to be achieved by refinancing the $425 million of parent company senior notes due in May 2014 and rationalizing operating costs that were previously allocated to the merchant generation business.","Turning to Page 5. The most significant first quarter development was the March agreement to divest the merchant generation business to an affiliate of Dynegy. We believe this transaction clarifies our strategic direction and value proposition to investors. It allows Ameren to focus exclusively on its rate-regulated electric, natural gas and transmission businesses. The divestiture reduces Ameren Corporation's business risk and is expected to substantially improve the predictably of future earnings and cash flows. These factors support our ongoing efforts to grow our earnings base and provide a solid sustainable dividend. The transaction removes $825 million of Genco's senior notes from Ameren's consolidated balance sheet. Also, it will result in an estimated $180 million at present value of deferred tax assets which are expected to be substantially realized in 2015. These tax benefits more than offset the cash requirements associated with the transaction. As a result, the rating agencies have stated that the merchant generation divestiture is credit positive for Ameren. In fact, Standard & Poor's upgraded Ameren Corporation's rating to BBB, shortly after the announcement of the transaction. We're working diligently with Dynegy to complete this transaction.","In April, we filed a request for the approval of divestiture with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And today, we plan to file with the Illinois Pollution Control Board for the required transfer to Dynegy of the variance related to the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard that we were granted in 2012. We continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year.","In addition, we have hired an investment bank to assist us in the sale of the 3 gas-fired energy centers that we retained with the exercise of the Genco put option and we have begun marketing these assets. We expect to complete the sale of these plants to a third-party by year end, subject to separate approval by the FERC.","Moving to Page 6. In addition to posting solid first quarter earnings from continuing operations and advancing the pending divesture of our merchant generation business, we're also making progress on our plans to invest substantial additional capital in FERC-regulated electric transmission projects. These projects will benefit customers through a more reliable and efficient electric system. Constructive, forward-looking formula ratemaking that is in place with these projects provides a reasonable opportunity for us to earn fair returns on our investments and recover our costs on a timely manner.","We plan to invest a total of approximately $2.2 billion in these FERC-regulated transmission projects over the 5-year period ending in 2017. Our single largest planned transmission investment is the Illinois Rivers project. This approximate $1.1 billion MISO-approved regional multi-value project involves the construction of a new high-voltage transmission line across the state of Illinois. It will enhance electric system reliability and create new construction jobs in the state. Our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the approximate 400 mile transmission line is pending at the ICC. In late March, the ICC staff filed initial testimony in response to this request, and we are pleased that the ICC staff recommended a certificate be granted for the project, subject to certain further considerations. We filed testimony last Friday to address the remaining concerns of the ICC staff. Hearings are scheduled for May 13 through May 17 with an ICC decision expected by August 20 of this year. Upon receipt of the certificate from the ICC, we will begin to acquire rights of way for the transmission line with the full range of construction activities expected to begin in 2014.","Turning now to Page 7. We also continue to pursue enhancements to the state regulatory frameworks for our utilities in both Missouri and Illinois. We are focused on improving our ability to invest in our utilities and states for the benefit of customers, communities and investors.","Turning first to Missouri. We, along with every other investor-owned electric utility in the state, strongly support the Infrastructure Strengthening and Regulatory Streamlining Act, commonly referred to as electric ISRS, which is currently pending in the Missouri General assembly. It is largely fashioned after the infrastructure recovery statute that has been utilized by the water and gas utilities in the state for nearly a decade. This proposed legislation is intended to modernize the Missouri electric regulatory framework by providing for a more timely recovery of investments that are in place and serving customers between rate cases. Further, it will enable us to make important incremental investments in our aging infrastructure to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations as well as create well-paying jobs. If enacted, this legislation would streamline regulation, as well as enhance many of the consumer protections in the current water and gas infrastructure laws, which already include very strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission.","Late last evening, the Missouri Senate debated the electric ISRS legislation. A final vote was not taken on the bill. We will continue to work with legislative leaders and other key stakeholders to see if we can move this legislation forward.","Having said that, consumer advocates and certain industrial customers are opposing this effort to modernize Missouri utility regulation. However, we consider such opposition to be rooted in a very shortsighted approach to state energy policy, and we continue to aggressively communicate why enacting this legislation, will be good for our customers and the state of Missouri. The time for Senate and House action is limited since the Missouri legislative session ends on May 17. We will continue to work tirelessly to pursue this important legislation for the state of Missouri.","Turning to Page 8, in Illinois. In 2011, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This act was intended to spur a decade of investment in electric delivery reliability, improved customer service and job creation. Last year, Ameren Illinois began selecting infrastructure projects and opened a Smart Grid training facility in Belleville, Illinois. The ICC also approved our Advanced Metering Infrastructure initiative. We continue to maintain that formula ratemaking can be constructive, if properly applied. However, in our view, the ICC misapplied the act in our 2012 electric delivery formula rate orders. Therefore, we strongly support Senate Bill 9, a legislative solution that clarifies application of the act regarding rate while maintaining strong consumer protections. Senate Bill 9 makes clear that year end, not average rate base and weighted average cost of capital not a short-term interest rate, should be used in electric delivery formula ratemaking. And we're pleased that the Illinois General assembly has overwhelmingly confirmed their legislative intent and approved this legislation. The bill is now on Governor Quinn's desk, and he must act on it by May 20.","As part of a two-pronged approach to ensure that the goals of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act are realized, Ameren Illinois has also appealed the 2012 electric rate orders to state appellate court. In addition, we support Illinois legislative efforts to enhance the ratemaking framework for gas delivery service. This, too, would allow us to accelerate infrastructure investment, deliver improved customer service and create jobs.","Turning to Page 9. I would like to close my prepared remarks with a summary of our planned investment in our rate-regulated utilities for the benefit of our customers, communities and investors. This is reflected in our regulated capital investment plans, which translates into expected rate base growth of approximately 7% annually from 2013 to 2017. With this growth, most rapid and regulatory jurisdictions with constructive formula ratemaking, we are moving forward on a path that will enhance our ability to earn fair returns on a growing level of utility investment. I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 10 of the presentation. Today, we reported a first quarter 2013 net loss, combining results from both continuing and discontinued operations of $0.60 per share, compared to first quarter 2012 net loss of $1.66 per share. The first quarter 2013 net loss included a loss of $0.82 per share from discontinued operations, incorporating an impairment charge to write-down the merchant generation business to its estimated fair value based upon the terms of the divestiture and other exit related after-tax charges. These after-tax charges were $195 million or $0.80 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Those charges will be reviewed as we move through 2013 with adjustments recorded in our financial statements as needed. We currently expect that the total after-tax charges will be less than the approximately $300 million we estimated when we announced the divestiture. As Tom previously discussed, Ameren recorded first quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations of $0.22 per share, compared with first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.15 per share.","On Page 11, we list the key factors that drove the $0.07 per share improvement in earnings. Factors favorably impacting first quarter 2013 earnings compared to those of the first quarter of 2012 included a return to normal winter weather compared to much warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2012. This boosted electric and natural gas sales lifting earnings by an estimated $0.10 per share and has estimated $0.07 in Missouri and $0.03 in Illinois. In addition, new rates from Missouri electric and Illinois transmission service increased earnings by $0.05 per share. And the absence in 2013 of a required nonrecoverable donation made in 2012 associated with the implementation of Illinois formula ratemaking for energy delivery service boosted earnings by $0.02 per share. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced first quarter 2013 weather normalized Illinois electric delivery revenues which lowered earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the first quarter of 2012. Reduced revenues are the result of variation in the timing and amount of expected full year recoverable costs between this year's first quarter and the year-ago period. We expect this variation to result in lower weather normalized earnings in the second quarter of 2013 and higher earnings in the third and fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012.","For the full year 2013, we expect weather normalized Illinois electric delivery earnings to increase compared to 2012, primarily reflecting increased investment for the benefit of our customers. Finally, higher operations and maintenance expenses at Ameren Missouri reduced first quarter 2013 earnings by $0.03 per share, net of certain rate recoveries compared to the first quarter of 2012. These higher expenses were primarily due to start up expenses related to the second quarter 2013 Callaway Nuclear Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage and higher storm-related costs.","Turning now to Page 12. I want to remind everyone that second quarter 2013 comparative results will be impacted by a few significant items. The first of these will be the second quarter 2013 expenses for the just mentioned Callaway Nuclear Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage which began in April. These expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.10 per share. There was no Callaway refueling outage in 2012. The second item is a favorable 2012 FERC order related to a disputed Missouri power purchase agreement that expired in 2009. That order resulted in a nonrecurring gain of $0.07 per share in the second quarter of last year. Finally, as previously discussed, variation in the timing of revenue recognition for Ameren Illinois' electric delivery service is expected to result in a decline in weather normalized earnings in the second quarter of 2013 compared to second quarter of 2012, though again the full year comparison is expected to be positive.","One other item is worth mentioning, we expect the Missouri Court of Appeals to issue a decision this year, possibly in the second quarter in its review of the Missouri Public Service Commission fuel adjustment clause order issued for Ameren Missouri in 2011. This court decision may impact comparative second quarter 2013 financial results. However, we believe potential financial impacts are accommodated by our earnings guidance range.","Turning then to Page 13. We move from earnings to a discussion of our updated 2013 free cash flow guidance. We calculate free cash flow by starting with our net cash provided by operating activities and subtracting from it our capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities, dividends and advances received for construction. For 2013, we now anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $500 million compared to our February 2013 guidance of a negative $435 million.","The updated estimate also includes merchant divestiture-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, including the $25 million of cash that is currently held at Genco. These divestiture-related cash outflows are more than offset by expected transaction-related cash tax benefits of approximately $180 million in present value to be substantially realized in 2015.","Finally, on Page 14 of our presentation, I will conclude my prepared remarks by summarizing key year-to-date accomplishments. In our view, first quarter financial results from continuing operations were solid with utility results in line with our expectations. Operating performance and service to customers has remained strong. We announced the divestiture of the merchant generation business to Dynegy and have begun taking the regulatory steps needed to close this transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. The divestiture will allow us to focus exclusively on our rate-regulated utilities and is expected to improve the predictability of our future earnings and cash flows. Our rate-regulated utility investment plans provide the foundation for growing our rate base at a compound annual rate of approximately 7% over the 5-year period ending in 2017, and Ameren's $1.60 per share annualized dividend rate is well covered by expected 2013 earnings from continuing operations and provides investors with a very attractive current yield of approximately 4.5%.","That concludes my prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sort of to the Missouri legislation, I mean, given that we got the May 17 deadline sort of showing up here and sort of the lack of movement over the last several weeks, how should we think about the potential for its passage? And if it doesn't pass, given the substantial amount of CapEx and rate-base growth that you guys have, how should we think about your ability to manage regulatory lag, if -- in its absence?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure. Paul, this is Marty. I think I'll let Warner Baxter, who's here with us, President of Missouri Operations. Go ahead and answer that question.","Warner L. Baxter","So a couple of things. First, your first question is related to the prospects for the passage of legislation. And you're right. And certainly, as we sit here today, it's difficult to predict really whether the legislation be passed at this time. And as we've talked about in the past, it's always a challenge to try and pass legislation. And certainly, with only 2 weeks left in the legislative session, and that challenge is going to be greater, especially in light of the continued opposition from certain consumer groups and certain large customers. But having said that, our team is going to continue to work closely with legislative leaders and other key stakeholders to see if we can move this legislation forward. And should we not get that legislation passed this session, we will continue to work tirelessly to get constructive legislation passed in the future to address, as you said, some of the additional capital expenditures that we may be making in the future and to address regulatory lag in Missouri. And the bottom line, we think this legislation and this path represents good long-term energy policy for Missouri, and it's going to help us address the aging infrastructure and certainly meet our customers' long-term needs and expectations. And the legislation we had before, the legislature today certainly has robust consumer protections. So we're going to continue to advocate for that policy because we think it's simply the right thing to do. Now with regard to the questions in terms of how we handle regulatory lag. We're going to continue to do what we've done in the past, and that we're going to continue to be very disciplined in our cost control and how we allocate capital in our business and certainly among all the Ameren businesses. And we're going to do what we've done also in the past and that's aligning our spend with the regulatory policies, outcomes and economic conditions. When the need arises, we will continue to file frequent rate cases to recover those investments. And as I said before, we're going to continue to pursue changes in the regulatory framework that will support investment because we are convinced that is the absolute best policy for the state of Missouri in the future.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I hear you. But just in general, I guess, there is a lot of opposition and I mean, in the absence of a change in regulatory policy, should we be thinking about sort of a ROE lag as we go forward, if there is no improvement, or -- I mean, I'm sure you guys are working hard or whatever, but just in general, I mean, how -- if you could just -- I don't know if you can address that or not, but just how should we think about that? And then just also sort of related, SB 9 sailed through the legislature in Illinois very, very well, but the gas stuff, the gas legislation seems to be sort of held up. I was just wondering if you could compare and contrast that.","Martin J. Lyons","Paul, this is Marty. I'll maybe try to tack on to what Warner said. I think as you look at what we've been able to accomplish over the past number of years in terms of Missouri regulation and Missouri earnings, certainly, over a series of rate cases, we've been able to achieve use of various riders and trackers for fuel or for energy efficiency or things of that nature, which have provided us a better opportunity to earn our allowed returns and we have meaningfully closed the gap between earned and allowed returns. Clearly, in the absence of some better framework for capital investment, it's hard to be able to earn those alloweds on a regular basis, if you're deploying significant amounts of capital. When you look overall at our plan going forward and you look at our 7% rate base growth plans across the enterprise, a heavy focus on those jurisdictions with formulaic ratemaking with the kinds of frameworks that allow us to make the investment for the benefit of our customers to grow jobs and to grow that rate base. If you look at the trends we put out in the past while we're investing still -- planning to still invest substantially in Missouri, the growth is at a much lower pace, again, providing ourselves the opportunity to earn something closer to our alloweds. And again, as Warner said, making sure that we continue to control our spending in order to position ourselves for success there. Now transitioning over to Illinois, you're right, the formulae -- the changes or the modifications to the formulaic rates for electrics did pass both chambers with very strong majority of votes there, and that's now before the governor. And then as it relates to the gas legislation, things have -- I'd say stalled a little bit there. I think legislative interest has moved somewhat away from the gas formula ratemaking and is focusing maybe on something more like an infrastructure rider or something of that nature. May I remind you that with respect to gas in Illinois, we do have the use of 4 test years. We've got a gas rate case pending right now and incorporates those 4 test years and it's where things kind of stand in Illinois.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I understand this week that the Missouri legislation actually hit a little bit of a speed bump. Just curious, are there specific concerns the industrial customers have and is there ways the legislation could be tailored to alleviate some of these concerns?","Warner L. Baxter","Michael, this is Warner again. The bill was debated last evening, as Tom said, and they ultimately did come to a vote. Certainly, there've been concerns cited by some of the industrial customers in terms of impact on rates and those types of things. And there have been efforts made to try and address that in the legislative -- in the legislation, and we will continue to have those discussions with those customers and other stakeholders to see if we can get something across the finish line. So we're going to continue to push to see if we can get something constructive done during these last 2 weeks.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And turning to Illinois, assuming that SB 9 is eventually made into law and assuming the litigation around the prior rate case kind of turns in your favor and upholds the law passed in 2011, is there still any remaining structural lag that exists for your Illinois distribution businesses? Meaning, are there are still some level of costs that simply aren't recoverable in rates? And if so, could you kind of quantify that level. Lots of state commissions don't allow things like incentive compensation or regional or local marketing costs, donations, that type of thing. Just trying to think about kind of what are the remaining drivers of lag, if any, once the whole legislative and litigation process plays out and assuming it plays out in your favor?","Thomas R. Voss","Sure, Michael. Thanks. There are some of those costs. And if you look back to our slides from our year-end call, we did outline some of those sort of structural things, if you will, that were there. When the law was passed in Illinois, while it did provide for formulaic ratemaking for the vast majority of costs that are incurred. Historical ICC ratemaking adjustments were preserved by that legislation. So we outlined some of those nonrecoverable costs. I think it was on Slide 13 of our year-end slide. Some of those nonrecoverable costs did include about $8 million of historical ratemaking adjustments. Those are the kinds of things that would be impactful going forward. This year, we identified some other things like $7 million of certain electrical system rework costs. Those, we expect to be -- they've occurred over a couple of years, last year and this year but we do expect those to diminish and to go away. So there are a little bit of things that continue to be there and then we have the opportunity and we'll continue to focus on those costs and make efforts to control and reduce those to the extent possible. But for the most part, Michael, the costs we incur in serving our customers, improving our service and reliability, are recovered through the formulaic process.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then a broader transmission question. We've seen in some regions of the country, in New England and Colorado and California, intervenors come in and file at the FERC to dramatically lower the base ROE in some of the RTOs. We haven't seen that type of Section 205 or --- I think it's 206 litigation yet in the MISO or in the SPP, I don't think. But just curious, if it did play out and if you saw lower authorized base ROEs for transmission, how would that impact your views in terms of dedicating as much capital as you're planning to interstate transmission projects?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Michael. You're right in terms of we haven't seen that type of push here. I think as you know, our FERC-authorized ROEs aren't really incentive ROEs like you might see in some jurisdictions. But to your question, I mean, to the extent that the ratemaking treatment or the ROEs were changed, it detracts from the incentive that exists today in investing in these large regional projects. They are significant amounts of capital deployment. They do like -- do have risks associated with them. We believe that the ROEs that we've got are appropriate. And to the extent that ROEs were reduced, it certainly would affect ours and I think other companies' thought process is about the investment opportunity. Whether they were abandoned or not, I certainly won't speculate. I'm just saying that it certainly becomes less attractive and there is less incentive there to take on these big projects.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe Research.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","I just have a question on the utility guidance or, I guess, overall guidance. But it seems that the midpoint of your guidance $2 to $2.20 reflects a utility midpoint of $2.30. Is that fair?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. I think that is fair. The -- when we provided the guidance, which is now guidance from continuing operations of $2 to $2.20, we also mentioned that we expected for the full year parent and other costs of about $0.20. And so that would -- if you do the math as you've done, that would imply for the regular utilities about $2.30.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just, I guess, what's driving that $0.05 increase in utility side?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, I think overall, as we go through the year, we've certainly seen -- I'll comment on a few things since you've opened the door on guidance, which I appreciate. First, on the -- I'll talk about maybe about the parent and other of about $0.20 that we see there. What's driving that is that -- as you go through sort of the accounting for continuing operations or discontinued operations, you've got to take costs that maybe were previously allocated to the merchant business. And to the extent that those aren't naturally going away with the business you're disposing of, you would continue to classify those in continuing operations. So some of the things driving that $0.20 are interest on the parent company that of about $425 million of parent company that -- which is about $0.10 of interest or so, and then there is G&A cost previously allocated to that merchant business that will be retained. For the time being, once the segment, the divestiture is actually completed, we'd certainly have the opportunity then to reduce and drive some of those costs out. And then there are other just sort of parent company costs that have existed through time that are in that $0.20. Then overall, with respect to utility results for the first quarter, as we talked about a lot of the improvement of last year was really driven by weather. We saw about a $0.10 improvement from weather overall. But when you strip out the weather and you look at weather normalized sales, overall, those were positive during the quarter. Overall, we saw residential and commercial sales up about 2% on a weather normalized basis across the company. And that was a positive sign and a little ahead of our expectations. We were expecting sort of little growth this year. We haven't really modified our expectations for the remainder of the year. We still expect little growth for the remainder of the year, but the quarter was a positive from that perspective. The sales versus normal, I mean -- meaning weather versus normalized, I should say, was a neutral. We didn't see much impact from weather versus normal conditions. So -- but we did see on the weather-normalized basis a bit of a pickup. And we would also expect to see for the remainder of the year some positive variances versus expectation in O&M, and we're also -- they are also expecting to see some positives from further infrastructure investment rate base growth in those areas where we have the formula ratemaking. So those are some of the drivers on the regulated side. I'd say that those -- we give the $2 to $2.20 guidance. It's $0.20 range. That parent company and other $0.20 is an approximation. I'd say probably, there's a little bit of a rounding up there. And so therefore, you derive $2.30. I'd say there would be a little bit of a rounding up there, too, in terms of the regulated midpoint.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Just so I heard right, you said weather-adjusted -- weather-normalized sales were up 2% residential?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, residential and commercial combined across the company. And we were pleased to see it. We saw a little bit of a positive growth in the same categories in the fourth quarter of last year though, you may recall, I think others do, in the third quarter last year, they were down. So weather normalization is an approximation. And when we looked over the course of last year, we had some ups and downs during the quarters over the course of the year. We actually saw residential and commercial sales down a little bit versus 2011 levels. So we're happy to see this trend. It's good to have this starting out the year, a little bit of a positive trend, but we'll -- I think we've still got a cautious view for the remainder of the year.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Got it. I appreciate walking -- you walking me through those steps. Just one  quick question on the dividend. What is the way we should look at dividend growth going forward from here?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. We've talked in the past about payout targets in the 55% to 70% of regulated earnings range. And we've given out specific guidance on when to expect increases going forward other than to say that we do have the 7% growth rate planned in rate base. With that, we would expect to grow our regulated earnings over time. And as we grow those regulated earnings, we would expect also to be in a position to be able to recommend to the board increases in the dividend.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So that 55% to 70% is regulated earnings, excluding the $0.20 or whatever that ultimately becomes of parent drag?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. I think that's a fair way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Kind of following up on the last one, actually. So you talk about $0.20 this year. You've talked about that abating somewhat. How much of that is due to the interest expense refi-ing in '14 and, I suppose, midyear and onwards. And how much of this is fundamentally just being able to reduce the G&A over time with the merchant gen segment out of the way now?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure. A good question. So the $0.20, as I broke it down, was probably about -- the $0.20, probably about $0.10 of interest and then $0.10 of G&A previously allocated to the merchant business, as well as some corporate overhead cost that we've had historically. So when you think about that parent company debt, as you know, $425 million of debt, 8.875 percentage or straight [ph]. In today's market, we'd be able to reduce that substantially, I think, better than -- cutting that better than 50%, Julien, maybe even by 2\/3. So on an annualized basis, decreasing that $0.10 by $0.06 or so wouldn't be unrealistic on an annualized basis. You're right. The refi for that would be a May time frame of next year. And then with respect to some of these other costs like the G&A costs that are in the parent company number this year that historically have been allocated to the merchant business, that's probably about $0.06 over the remainder of this year. And we certainly can't reduce or eliminate those costs until the divestiture is completed. But then we we'd expect to be able to reduce those through time. We talked a couple of calls ago about the expectation that we believe we could eventually eliminate those fully. That may take through the end of '15 to be able to get there when they're fully gone. But we would expect to be able to begin to reduce those substantially next year. And so what we've said is we expect that $0.20 this year to go down to a range of $0.10 to $0.15 next year. And then those would -- those costs would further diminish the year after that as you get the full year benefit of the refinanced parent company debt and you fully reduce the drag from those G&A costs previously allocated to the merchant business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if I hear you're right, call it a run rate around '15 time frame, $0.20 minus $0.06 with interest expense, at least minus another $0.06, once you fully eliminate the allocated cost, so less than $0.10 easily.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, less than a $0.10 is what I'm getting as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, fantastic. And then going over to the ATX side of the world, perhaps a little bit similar to the last question. When you're thinking about your successes on developments, what are the next important data points? And as you think about it, how do you feel about the execution on the -- just deploying capital, if you will? And maybe a secondary question off that, also looking at CapEx, how would EIMA change your CapEx outlook, too? Your EIMA, yes.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. I think I missed the first part of your question. What was the base part of your question?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, the base part was more ATX, how do you feel about deployment, what are the next key milestones in terms of it? I mean, it seems like there have been some developments in the quarter.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, no, there would, so -- in terms of outline, there have been good development. So certainly filed for the ICC Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity as it relates to the Illinois Rivers project, which is sort of a big centerpiece, multi-value project that we've got planned over the next several years, $1.1-billion project. As we updated, the staff filed some initial testimony. Overall, we saw it as positive, where the staff overall was recommending that the ICC grant a certificate for the project. We've recently, as you know probably, filed rebuttal. For the upcoming dates there, our ICC hearing is in the May time frame. And we're still expecting an order. And we're optimistic that we'll see the -- get the ICC certificate and be able to move forward then late this year with the right-of-way acquisition and next year with that full-range construction activities. So we're anxious to begin deploying capital relative to that project. We feel like the testimony we provided in response to ICC and others' testimony, we hope, was responsive. And we hope to see the ICC approval and begin to move forward. So there is -- those are some of the key milestones. Certainly, those -- the expectation of being able to move forward with that project on sort of the time frame I just outlined is really key to the overall plans we have to grow rate base at that 7% rate that we talked about earlier.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then EIMA, just I'm curious, like how much CapEx upside are we talking there?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, there -- what we did, we really -- if you look at our CapEx plans, we didn't substantially change those as a result of the ICC order the last year. We eliminated about $30 million of the planned capital spending for this year but didn't really substantially change the plans that we have longer term. We're certainly optimistic that we will see the appropriate modifications made to the legislation to provide the clarity about the legislative intent. And at that point, we'd be in a position to add back that $30 million of reduced capital spending to our forecast.","Operator","Our next question caller is from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","I think most of my questions have been answered. Warner, I just wanted to -- just going back to the legislation, we know that end date of the thing. But what is like -- right, it has to first get passed from the Senate then go to the House? And if I'm right, is the bill in the House the same right now? Or does it have to go to a committee? Can you just walk us through what the path could be for approval? How does it go from one to the other and then get approved?","Warner L. Baxter","Sure, sure, Ashar. This is Warner. One, there are several vehicles that are still available in both the House and the Senate. You have your original bills, which are HB 398, House Bill 398, and then Senate Bill 207. If those bills would be approved, they would have to go through committees on either side of the House to move forward. And so a likely path to move forward now, between now and May 17, would be to amend and approve Senate or House Bill. Once -- so say a House Bill is on the Senate side and that has been amended by the Senate and sent back over to the House, then simply, the House can take that bill and vote it up or down. It does not have to go through all the committee process. And indeed, that's certainly an approach that's being considered in both the Senate and the House right now. So is it possible to get something done in the next 2 weeks utilizing those vehicles? The answer is yes. But as we said before, you have 2 weeks. And that still takes time to get through some of the processes. But it isn't as extensive as the original bill process we have today.","Ashar Khan","Okay. But just practically thinking, we have to see, say, some movement by the 12th or 13th of May. Is that a good point because it has to pass the Senate? Or can it all be done on 1 day, the last day?","Warner L. Baxter","Well Ashar, the only thing I've seen in Missouri politics and the legislature, it is pretty amazing how things can get done in the last few days. Having said that, the more time you have to move things, the better you are. And certainly, every day is precious when it gets down to the last 2 weeks. So I can't say there is a specific cutoff date one way or the other, but there are hosts of -- there are vehicles. But just because there are vehicles doesn't mean that there still aren't some challenges to get through both sides of either the House or the Senate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question -- a follow-on on ATX and the CPCN process. First question is, could you elaborate a bit on the staff position, what that kind of came back with it? And how you responded to it? What were the concerns? And the second question and separate from this is, I believe you're pursuing a couple of other meaningful projects with ATX in Illinois. And I want to know how you think about the likelihood and timing of these projects? What do we need to see happen to sort of push these into being -- happening? Would it be low growth, coal unit retirements, et cetera?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Neil. This is Marty again and -- one thing I'd refer you to overall what I thought was a good piece of testimony is the president of our transmission company, Maureen Borkowski, and the testimony that we filed recently in response to the ICC, to interveners in the case. But Maureen's testimony, I think, provided sort of an overview of the issues that have been raised or concerns that have been raised and the overall ATXI response to those. And she summarized well, I think, both the concerns, as well as the comments that we were providing back. And I think, Neil,  overall, in my view, the interveners I mentioned earlier, the staff in particular, overall recommended that the ICC go ahead and provide the certificate. But there were questions raised about the need for certain specific substations. There were concerns or questions raised about the paths for certain segments of the overall project and the lines. And in that regard, we have provided testimony supporting why the substations we proposed are needed for reliability or other reasons and why the routing that we proposed makes sense. And I think there were also a number of stipulated sort of settlements reached with a number of parties that had raised questions along the way as well. And those were also, again, summarized in Maureen's testimony. So again, by and large, in summary, I felt like, looking at it, that overall that the project was certainly needed. The question was about the path and the need for certain elements. But again, we feel like we've largely addressed those in the testimony. So I think that's the Illinois Rivers project. The MISO has already approved a number of other multi-value projects back in December of 2011, the Spoon River project, the Mark Twain project. And then there are some other pending projects, like the Big Muddy River Project. All those projects, again, have been approved by MISO as multi-value projects and -- so the plan would be to go ahead and move forward with those projects over time. And I don't know that there is really anything pending in terms of further demonstration of need for the project. It's just a matter of sequencing the projects and moving forward on them.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just to clarify then, with those projects that have been approved by MISO, should we sort of expect those from an end-service date as being sort of outside the 5-year period. Kind of get the Illinois Rivers through and done and then as you kind of go in and go for other projects as well over time?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, that's -- I think that's largely a way to think about it. I mean, within the 5 years, there could be certainly some spending on those projects. But the overall transmission growth plans that we have certainly do extend beyond the 5-year window that we're presenting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitchell Moss with Lord, Abbett.","Mitchell Moss","Just a quick question on the Genco business. There's been some talk on the other -- from some of the other conference calls today that there's been some basis issues. Could you talk about whether or not you've seen any basis issues for some of your plants?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. I think that -- over time, I do think that the -- historically, at the Illinois hub location, there has been some basis discount to Indy hub, which is typically looked at as a more liquid trading hub in our region. And what we've been seeing any way in the recent, say, 12-month time frame for the merchant business is probably a basis discount to Indy hub around the clock of about 12% or so. And we've seen those basis differentials certainly fluctuate over time.","Mitchell Moss","Did you see it widen at all in the first quarter?","Martin J. Lyons","It -- I can't comment specifically on the first quarter, but it has fluctuated over time. And a 12% kind of basis differential isn't historically out of the norm or abnormal when you look back to say that's some of the 2011 data and the like. So they just -- it does fluctuate over time.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. And was it -- do you see it as a general transmission constraints? Are there, I mean, just line outages over time? Or are there any other unique issues going on that you've observed?","Martin J. Lyons","I can't really pinpoint any unique issues as it relates to our system. The things you mentioned are things that historically have impacted basis differentials. So certain generator outages or transmission line outages, load fluctuations, all of those things can affect basis differential from time to time. We'll see basis differentials  differentiate seasonally based upon demands on the system. So all of those things you mentioned, certainly, are contributors from time to time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Levy with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levy","Most of the questions were asked, but just to kind of do some math here. I don't know if you'll be willing to walk through it with me, but -- so kind of based on starting in that $2.20 to $2.40 range at utility earnings that you kind of talked about for this year, right. I mean, that's...","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, well, what we did is we gave guidance for $2 to $2.20. And we said the parent and other were approximately $0.20, which would imply approximately $2.30 for the utilities.","Andrew Levy","Right, midpoint.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, so the midpoint, right. So we didn't give out that specific rate.","Andrew Levy","Okay. I follow you. I apologize. I said bear with me here. But then you seem to have like rate base growth of about 7% a year, if I'm not mistaken, which probably turns into about 5% earnings growth. And I know you haven't given guidance. But is that kind of a good ballpark to kind of think about?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, you're right. We haven't given that out. What we've talked about is that 7% growth rate in rate base and -- but I think if you model it out, you should see some sort of similar trend rate with respect to earnings. But certainly, I'm not commenting on specifically the 5%.","Andrew Levy","I've got it. So if you kind of did that and you kind of go back to Julien's -- answers to Julien's questions, I mean, you probably could look at earnings in the $2.50 type range for '15 and that's kind of what I'm thinking. But kind of what you said on the rate base kind of helps me with that. So I appreciate it. That was my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First of all, you indicated the Illinois timing issue should be a headwind in the second quarter. Can you kind of quantify that?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So we did talk a little bit about one of the headwinds we saw in the first quarter compared to last year. It wasn't unexpected from our perspective but was just the timing of revenue recognition this year versus last year as it related to the Illinois delivery -- electric delivery service. So in Q2, we expect that to maybe a $0.03 negative versus last year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is this going to continue to whipsaw around? Or do we lap this at some point and it stabilizes?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, hopefully, we'll see it stabilize next year versus this year. Maybe I can -- I'll try to describe for you sort of the phenomenon that's causing this though, which is that we're -- obviously, our earnings for the full year, our revenues for the full year, are ultimately determined by our actual costs incurred in that year. As we got into -- the last year was the first year, obviously, that we were accounting for this new regulatory regime, if you will. Going into last year, we projected what our cost of service was going to be. We projected what the ROE was going to be based on 30-year treasuries, and we had an expectation of how the Illinois law would be applied by the ICC. So as we went through the first couple of quarters last year, we were recognizing revenue based on those overall expectations. As we got into the third quarter of last year towards the end, we saw that the cost of service was less than the -- cost to service for the full year was going to be less than we had previously estimated. We had an ICC order, which changed our expectations. And the 30-year treasuries were coming out as well lower than expectations. Therefore, in the third quarter, we had a downward revision to the revenues that have been recognized over the first half of the year and then a further adjustment in the fourth quarter. So those -- the accounting model is still in place and we're still, say in this first quarter, recognizing revenues based on our full year expected cost of service for that business. So there still could be some volatility from year to year. But I would expect that to dampen over time. Last year was the first year where we're kind of working through this new process and, I think, probably bigger fluctuations this year versus last, than we should see moving forward. So in Q1, we estimated that the impact was about $0.08 in terms of negative impact versus last year. Due to that, as I mentioned, about $0.03 in the second quarter. We expect that, that then will reverse. As I mentioned, last year in the third quarter, we had a downward revision. We expect that then, year-over-year in the third quarter of this year, we would see a benefit. And it could be in the range of as much as $0.10 of positive impact in Q3, another $0.04 in Q4 so that over the course of the year, you're up a few cents versus last year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what's the order of magnitude of the Missouri Appeals Court depending on how that goes?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. So that could swing either way. And you'll recall that we have actually recognized a charge in the prior year of about $18 million or $0.04. So that could reverse. On the other hand, if that goes against us, it could be a negative of up to about another $26 million or $0.06. So it's a range of about a plus $0.04 to a minus $0.06 on that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And you would keep that in ongoing earnings or...","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. We have historically had that in ongoing earnings. And I would say on the minus $0.06, that would really be dependent upon how things ultimately played out with the commission on those remaining costs, so that we do have before the commission a request for accounting authority order on that to be able to defer and recover some of those costs. But we'll just have to see how all of that plays out.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time, Mr. Fischer.

[Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Kirk, you may begin.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you. Good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that's accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.","To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that we will reference by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements.","Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.","For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-looking Statements section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC.","Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now here's Warner, who will start on Page 4 of our presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.72 per share compared to $0.97 per share earned in 2018.","A summary of the key drivers of the year-over-year decrease to $0.25 per share as provided on Slide 4, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. I'm pleased to report that despite some weather related headwinds in the second quarter, we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan. And today reaffirmed our 2019 earnings guidance range of $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share, reflecting solid year-to-date results.","In particular, I would like to note that during the second quarter some of our customers and the communities we serve were affected by historic flooding and tornadoes. While, the impact on our operations and financial results was manageable, the impact on our customers and communities by these severe weather events was in some cases devastating.","Our thoughts and prayers remain with those who have been affected by these events. We continue to work with our customers, local communities, agencies, and governmental leaders to help our customers in several ways, including providing energy assistance funds.","I also want to thank our co-workers for their extraordinary efforts to safely restore service to our customers, maintain safe and reliable service throughout our operations as well as volunteering their time to help those in need during this challenging period. It was clearly a tremendous team effort.","Moving to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well throughout the year, we expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders.","The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multi-year focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers and our jurisdictions that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks.","As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of the year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to better serve our customers. These investments are delivering value to our customers. Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient, and secure, new smart meters are providing our customers with better tools to manage their energy usage and our digital technology investments are enhancing our customer's experience with us.","Of course, we're not done, looking ahead, we continue to see the need for robust energy infrastructure investments to meet our customers\u2019 energy needs and exceed their rising expectations. And we remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence, continuous improvement and discipline cost management to keep our customers cost competitive and affordable.","For example, in mid-May we completed the 23rd nuclear refueling and maintenance outage and Ameren Missouri Callaway Energy center safely on time and on budget. This is just one example of many focused efforts across the company that has helped keep our electric rates in both Missouri and Illinois, well below the Midwest and national averages.","Speaking of keeping our electric rates low and competitive for our customers, in early July, Ameren filed a request for a $1 million decrease in annual electric service revenue with the Missouri Public Service Commission. This marks the second potential reduction in electric rates since August, 2018 the request incorporates the benefits of lower coal and transportation expenses as well as other operating costs and provides for recovery of and a return on important new infrastructure investments.","This filing also provides flexibility to time next rate review to include wind generation investments planned for the fourth quarter of 2020. We look forward to working with the Missouri PSC staff and other stakeholders in this important matter in the months ahead. I am also pleased to report that in late July Ameren Missouri was able to reach a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement in our pending natural gas rate review.","Consistent with our focus on keeping our customers energy costs competitive and affordable, this agreement will lower Missouri's natural gas customers rates by $1 million as well and will continue to enable us to use the gas infrastructure recovery mechanism between rate reviews to support important and timely investments for our natural gas customers in the future.","These two Missouri rate review filings are in addition to Ameren Illinois\u2019 annual electric formula rate update request for a $7 million rate decrease filed in April.","Marty will go into more detail on both the Missouri Electric and gas rate reviews, as well as the Illinois electric rate update in a moment. But as you can see, we are clearly focused on keeping our customers costs competitive and affordable while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure investments to deliver long-term value.","Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks. Constructive electric grid modernization legislation that would extend electric formula rate making for 2032 while widely supported was not brought to a vote before the full Illinois General Assembly due to other legislative matters taking priority during this year's general session. ","It is clear that modernizing energy policies in Illinois, including formula rate making are driving significant incremental investments on it's electric and natural gas energy infrastructure.","Together, these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable costs, but they have also created thousands of new jobs in the state of Illinois.","With these benefits in mind, Policymakers have already extended electric formula rates twice since 2012 which are currently effective through 2022. We will continue to work to extend this important grid monetization legislation again in the future.","This fall, the Illinois legislature is scheduled to conduct this annual veto session with the electric grid modernization legislation and other proposed energy legislation could be considered. At this time, it is premature to predict whether any of these legislative proposals will be addressed during the veto session.","Turning to Page 6, for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, which includes creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.","Here we outline our renewable energy investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. We have previously announced three build-transfer agreements for a total of 857 megawatts of wind generation at an estimated costs of approximately $1.4 billion.","And as you might recall, the capital spending and related rate base guidance that we provided to you in February of this year included approximately $1 billion for 557 megawatts of wind generation to be placed in service in 2020.","There have been several recent developments with our wind generation projects to update you on. I will begin with our build-transfer agreement with EDF for 157 megawatt facility, the smallest of our three projects.","Last week, Ameren and EDF mutually agreed to terminate this project due to unacceptably high transmission and its connection cost estimates that were received from both MISO and SPP during the second of three phases of interconnection cost studies.","During this phase of the process, it was determined that the addition of this wind project would require significant costs to enhance the transmission system. These projected costs were far greater than those anticipated and MISO\u2019s estimate after the first phase of this process.","We simply had to terminate this project due to the unacceptably high transmission costs that made this project no longer economic and not in the best long-term interest of our customers. Of course, we are disappointed that we had to take this action.","We felt that the EDF wind facility had the potential to bring significant value to our customers and the state of Missouri. That said, we are very pleased with progress on our larger proposed wind generation investments.","A 400 megawatt wind facility located in northeast Missouri and a 300 megawatt wind facility located in northwest Missouri. In particular, in May 2019, we announced that Ameren Missouri, reached an agreement with the subsidiary of Enel to acquire after construction a 300 megawatt wind facility.","Shortly thereafter we filed for a certificate of convenience and necessity or CCN with the Missouri PSC. I am very happy to report that this week we reached a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the Missouri PSE staff and other parties that recommended the Missouri PSC grant a CCN for this project.","Missouri PSC decision is expected by October. If ultimately approved the CCM would be in addition to the previously granted CCN for the 400 megawatt Terra-Gen wind facility. Notably, a lot of my comments a few minutes ago on transmission interconnection costs.","I am also pleased to inform you that we have already received the third and final phase transmission and a connection cost estimates from MISO for both projects, which were in-line with our expectations. We expect to finalize the interconnection agreements later this fall.","We believe we are very well positioned to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and move forward with the time the construction of these two important renewable energy projects for the state of Missouri","Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio and are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year. As a result, we expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments.","To summarize, we now have in place build-transfer agreements for 700 megawatts of wind generation. Together, our investment in these two projects is expected to approximate $1.2 billion or approximately $200 million in excess of the capital spending and rate base guidance we provided to you in February.","At this time, these investments are also expected to fulfill our needs to comply with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard in 2021. We will continue to explore additional renewable energy investment opportunities that will drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. These opportunities include our previously announced Renewable Choice program. This Missouri PSC approved program allows large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities to elect to receive up to 100% of their energy from renewable resources.","The program enables us to supply customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation of which up to 200 megawatts we could own. We're still in early stages of this program. Further and consistent with Ameren Missouri Smart Energy plan, this month we expect to file CCNs with the Missouri PSC to build three solar plus storage facilities across the state.","Each location will connect solar energy generation and battery storage. The installations are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and we'll be the first of their kind in the state. Importantly, these proposed facilities will bring increased reliability to our customers in a cost effective manner. Finally, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities for the benefit of our customers in the context of our next comprehensive integrated resource plan which we plan to file in September, 2020. Needless to say, we have a lot of exciting things going on in the renewable energy space in Missouri.","Moving on to Page 7, to sum up our value proposition, we believe that the execution of our strategy in 2019 and beyond, we'll continue to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. In February, we rolled forward our five-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2018 through 2023 period, using 2018 weather normalized core earnings per share as a base.","This earnings growth is primarily driven by expected 8% compound annual rate base growth over the same period. And I will point out that we have a strong pipeline of investments that benefit our customers in the future. Our strong earnings growth expectation positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions.","Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook combined with our solid dividend, which currently provides a yield of approximately 2.5% results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.","Again, thank you all for joining us today and I'll now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner and good morning everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, today we reported second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.72 per share, compared to earnings of $0.97 per share for the year ago quarter. Here we highlight the key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.25 per share decrease. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment reported decreased earnings of $0.25 per share. This reflected lower electric retail sales which decreased earnings by an estimated $0.22 per share, primarily due to mild early summer temperatures in the quarter compared to extremely warm temperatures in the second quarter of last year.","Ameren Missouri\u2019s results also reflected this year's scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway Energy Center that reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to 2018 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2020. These items were partially offset by the positive comparative impacts of timing differences in 2018 related to federal tax reform, which are not expected to impact full year earnings comparisons.","Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were down $0.01 per share primarily due to a change in rate design, which is not expected to impact full year results. And finally, Ameren Parent and other results decreased $0.02 per share, primarily due to timing of income tax expense, which is also not expected to impact full year results.","Earnings per share for Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were up $0.02 and $0.01, reflecting increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings reflect a lower expected allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 8.5% in 2019, compared to 8.9% for the prior year. The 2019 ROE is based on a projected 2019 average 30-year treasury yield of 2.7%, down from the 2018 average of 3.1%.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first six months of this year compared to the first six months of last year.","Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased 1%, excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under MEEIA. Kilowatt-hour sales to low margin Missouri industrial customers decreased 2.5%, after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan.","We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 2%, and kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, did not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.","Moving then to Page 10 of our presentation, despite the weather-related headwinds discussed earlier, our year-to-date results are solidly on track and we continue to expect 2019 diluted earnings to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page.","I will not comment specifically on these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and consistent with the 2019 earnings drivers and assumptions discussed on our February earnings call and the balance of the year considerations outlined on our first quarter call.","Moving now to Page 11, here we begin to outline in more detail, our recently filed Missouri electric rate review that Warner mentioned earlier. Base rates were last reset April 1, 2017, and are required to be reset at least every four years to allow for continued use of the fuel adjustment clause. This filing will allow us to meet that requirement and provide flexibility to time our next rate review to include our wind generation investments. Missouri PSC decision is expected by late April, 2020 with new rates expected to be effective in late May.","Now let me take a moment to go through the details of this filing. The request includes a 9.95% return on equity and 51.9% equity ratio and at December 31, 2019 estimated rate base of $8 billion. It is based on a 2018 test year with certain pro forma adjustments through the end of 2019 and January 1, 2020.","Further as outlined on Page 12, the key drivers of our $1 million annual revenue decrease include decreased net energy costs, otherwise subject to recovery through the fuel adjustment clause reflecting lower coal and transportation expenses, a higher level of weather-normalized customer sales volumes to recover costs, decreased expenses other than net energy costs of which a portion was otherwise subject to regulatory recovery mechanisms and recovery of and return on increased infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers including those otherwise deferred under plant-in-service accounting or PISA.","We've received a number of questions with respect to PISA mechanics between rate reviews and in this rate review. While PISA meaningfully reduces regulatory lag, we still experience some lag on recovery of depreciation expenses and the return on projects placed in service between rate cases.","PISA allows us to defer and recover 85% of depreciation expense and return on rate base related to qualifying plant, which is nearly all plant placed in service. Such deferrals continue to accumulate until the related plant becomes part of rate base included in a subsequent rate review.","As a result, 15% of such costs continue to result in lag between rate reviews. In addition, accounting rules only allow for the recognition and earnings of Ameren Missouri's cost of debt, with respect to the 85% of return on rate base deferred under PISA, until such deferrals are reflected in rates. This results in a temporary lag and reported returns but no ultimate economic loss.","Of course, we seek to manage Ameren Missouri's business to reduce regulatory lag inherent in its framework to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible while being mindful of operating and other business needs.","Moving out of Page 13, for other regulatory reviews. In December, 2018, we filed a natural gas rate review with Missouri PSC. In late July, we reached a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the Missouri PSC staff and certain interveners for $1 million annual revenue reduction and no other parties to the rate review object.","While this was a black box agreement, it specifically provides for the use of the actual Ameren Missouri capital structure as of May 31, 2019 of 52% equity in a range of reasonable allowed ROE of 9.4% to 9.95% including the use of 9.725% for the infrastructure rider. The Missouri PSC decision is expected in August with new rates expected to be effective in September.","Moving to Illinois, in April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing under Illinois formula rate making our utilities required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In late June, the ICC staff issued its recommendation which was comparable to Ameren Illinois\u2019 request. And ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January, 2020.","Finally, turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2019, as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by rate base growth and disciplined financial management.","Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. In addition, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to our peers.","That concludes my prepared remarks. With that, we now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","God morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning.","Warner Baxter","How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","How are you?","Warner Baxter","Terrific, thank you. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Not bad. So maybe just to kick things off, if I can, I'd love to go back to your comments Warner on the terminated agreement with EDF and how you're thinking about next step? And also just to make sure that you've secured your interconnection upgrade costs and firm those up on the other projects as well, do you think this was very much isolated in this project or is this kind of a wider theme that you're seeing in the MISO footprint?","Warner Baxter","Yes, thanks Julien. So a couple of things, number one, yes, with regard to the two projects that we have, the 400 megawatt project and the 300 megawatt project we have the final interconnection costs done. And that the case with the EDF that was only in the second stage so now those other two are done.","So now keep in mind for the 400 megawatt project, we have the CCN already and so a well positioned that can move forward on that. We still have to get the interconnection agreement, but we expect that by the fall. And so we don't see any major issues with that. With the 300 megawatt project, as you heard me say, we\u2019re real pleased to get a non-unanimous stipulation with the Missouri Public Service Commission staff. ","And so we're well positioned to have that the review by the Missouri Public Service Commission and we look forward to having that in, hopefully a decision by October. So as I step back and look where we're at with the 700 megawatts that we have in place, I think we're very well positioned to get the necessary regulatory approvals and to begin construction in those projects and to get them all in service by the end of 2020.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And just to clarify here, with respect to the initial project that was terminated, your expectation then you'd go back to try to find an alternative project, restructure this project somehow to address some of the transmission costs, however that might ever be possible or perhaps just forego it altogether because obviously as you said, you're ahead of the plan as you initially described anyway.","Warner Baxter","Yes, so good question Julien. So look, the bottom line is, is that with the 700 megawatts now that we've announced, we are in compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. So we're well positioned and in fact that's consistent with what we've said at the outset of these conversation and consistent with our integrated resource plan.","But like I also said, we continue to look at renewable energy investment opportunities and now I mentioned that the Renewable Choice program certainly will file an updated integrated resource plan next year. So we're not done taking entire renewable energy projects is my message. But with regard to the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard, we will be in compliance with these two projects that we plan on executing next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And if you permit me just to follow up here, with respect to transmission once more, we've seen some interesting headlines thus far on the MISO 2019 plans and where those budgets are coming in. Also, I suppose September we're going to see the next round of the draft FY2020. How are you thinking about altogether, transmission spending trajectories, if you can comment at least initially on some of the procedures?","Warner Baxter","Look, this is why I sit here today obviously with regard to the other project. I can't speak to the other projects, I can speak to ours. And as I said a moment ago, all the two projects that we got across the finish line, they were in line with what our estimates were. We certainly don't have visibility to all the projects that are going on in the system. That's certainly something that MISO has the visibility.","But what I will say when you talk about broader transmission, you think about all the interconnection agreements and all the things going on here. I do continue to say and believe that when you look to the long-term that there is an opportunity for us as a system in MISO to look at multi-value projects to try and address the transmission matters issues that we see today and the continued desire to put more renewable energy generation on our system.","So this is an area of focus as Shawn Schukar and all of our team are working with MISO and many others to be thinking about. We have to get through these interconnection agreements today, but we need to be speaking about those multi-value projects down the road because that's what's going to enhance our overall system prospectively.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Another round of MVP. Excellent. Well, thank you there. I'll leave it.","Warner Baxter","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Greg. Greg, you there?","Operator","Greg, are you muted? Greg, you're live with our speaker.","Warner Baxter","Well, let me go to the next question. If Greg can get back into queue, if he jumps back on, please.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. Good morning. Go back to your comments, I just want to clarify \u2013 want to make sure I understand regarding the potential solar\/battery facilities. Is that something that new or something new that you guys are considering for the CCN? And again, it seems like the timing that you talked about at the end of 2020, kind of matches up with the last 157 megawatts of the other wind but is this potentially to serve as an offset to your plans?","Warner Baxter","So I'm going to let Michael Moehn talk about this exciting project. And so Michael, I know this is part of your Smart Energy plan, so why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about the benefits that he's going to bring to customers.","Michael Moehn","Perfect. Thanks, Warner. Good morning. Yes, so really these three projects that Warner referred to these battery plus storage facilities, there's three projects across the Missouri footprint. And they really are focused primarily on reliability enhancement. So we are making these investments in lieu of investments that we would need to make in sub stations, et cetera, to enhance the reliability on that system.","There will be some environmental benefits associated with them. They have some renewable energy credits that come as part of the solar project. So, I mean they \u2013 we will account for those, but they really are being driven by economics and reliability thing. We're excited about them, so hopefully more to come there. But as Warner said, we're going to be filing those CCN very, very soon for those two projects.","Warner Baxter","So Insoo, you also had a question in there as to whether this was incremental to our existing plan. They are not incremental. They have been part of our five year plan, part of the smart energy plan. We mentioned these projects as part of our comments because these are innovative technology projects that we're doing on behalf of our customers and certainly have part of the renewable energy space as well.","Marty Lyons","So yes, I think just one important note on that 15% requirement that we have as part of the Missouri Renewable Standard, there is a 2% requirement for solar as well 2% of that 15%. So these will go to satisfy some of that as well.","Insoo Kim","Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, can you Marty, give us any more insight to your thinking on how you're planning to fund the wind acquisitions next year? Should we assume for planning purposes that the financing will be next year or any thoughts to any kind of a forward component to get that off the table today, just what\u2019s your latest thought there?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Ali. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Overall, I have to say our financing plans haven't really changed from what we communicated to you and others on the February call and then again on the May call. On the February call, you recall that, we laid out our $13.3 billion five-year capital expenditure plan that included about, at that time $1 billion for wind, today as you heard on the call, it looks like $1.2 billion of wind. And as you also heard, we do feel confident about those projects.","We said at that time, of course, and we reiterated May, I should say that our financing plan included equity issuances under our DRIP and our employee benefit plans about a $100 million a year and the issuance of common equity to fund a portion of Ameren Missouri\u2019s wind acquisitions. We believe those two sources of equity, Ali, will allow us to fund the capital expenditure plan while maintaining approximately the same capitalization levels we have currently and our current credit ratings, which as you know, we've worked hard to achieve.","So sifting through all that and answer your question, I would say that other than the DRIP and employee benefit plan issuances and with respect to our current capital expenditure plans, we have no plan to equity \u2013 external equities other than for these wind projects, which are expected to close next year in the fourth quarter of 2020.","So with respect to your question about options, we do have options in terms of accessing the equity markets. We're clearly aware of the ways our peer utilities have approached the equity markets. We're monitoring market conditions and ultimately we'll move forward in the manner that we think is most appropriate given the funding needs. So I think that's what we've got to say on it, I don't think I'll comment beyond that but we recognized the options that we have before us.","Ali Agha","And Marty, can you also remind us, do you still believe there is a further debt capacity at the [indiscernible] company level at this stage for Ameren?","Marty Lyons","Look, we've laid out the financing plans that we have. I think you're aware of the credit ratings that we have overall and where the thresholds are. We've talked about that on prior calls, Moody's, we have a BBB+ and FFO to debt threshold of 13%. At Moody's, Baa1, the threshold is a little bit higher there with a CFO pre-working capital to debt of 17%. And so a little bit \u2013 I can say, less cushion there with respect to the Moody's rating.","So we're conscious of that. We watch where the credit metrics are. We like those credit ratings, we'd like to hold those credit ratings. And we think about other factors, maintaining a strong balance sheet, positioning these various investments like the wind for success in the regulatory environments. And ultimately, all of that led us to the conclusions that we reached and communicated earlier this year.","And as I just repeated that, overall we want to keep our capitalization levels approximately where they're at today at all of our legal entities. And we do plan to fund a portion of these wind investments with equity and we think that's the right balance overall.","Ali Agha","Got it. And my second question related to the 13.3 billion five year plan. I know in the past you all have talked about that the Missouri legislation, incentive, that there was more CapEx potentially you could spend, there was more need for CapEx at Missouri. And I'm just wondering when's the next time you all will update us on the CapEx plans and should we assume that there is potentially upside to this plan that currently is at 13.3 billion.","Marty Lyons","This is Marty and I'll start off in case others want to jump in, but I would say that, traditionally we update our long-term capital expenditure plans in February, on our year end call. As we noted on this call, we put out a $13.3 billion plan this past February. That included $1 billion for wind now we stand at $1.2 billion. So, logically we'd include that in February.","And then with respect to further grid modernization, we'll continue to assess that. Last year when we rolled forward our five year plan, we updated our capital expenditures across the board, notably in Missouri, increased our capital expenditure plan excluding the wind about $1.5 billion versus the prior five year plan.","So we've incorporated a considerable amount of incremental, infrastructure spending, in that plan. But you're absolutely right in terms of that $1.5 billion, that was only a percentage, a fraction of the overall, potential incremental capital expenditure that we can make, at Ameren Missouri over time.","So I don't want to speculate today on what we may or may not add next February, but clearly we have a very large infrastructure, investment pipeline and some great projects incremental to those that we've already put in the current five year plan, incremental projects that we think would bring great value to our customers.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregory Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Gordon ","Yes. So I know you did talk about the energy infrastructure legislation that I guess has been tabled for the potentially the veto session coming up in the fall. Can you talk about what it is that you specifically would like to see that legislation, accomplish if it does get considered and then also, Vistra had their earnings call earlier today and they've made a proposal with regards to coal to solar plant that I think, is the basically impacts the assets that you sold Dynegy all those years ago. How do you see that even though it doesn't have obviously a direct financial impact at Ameren\u2019s P&L, how do you see that proposal? Do you think it's beneficial overall to your customers? Would you be supportive of it or any other comments you might want to, give us on that topic?","Warner Baxter","Sure. Thanks Greg. This is Warner. So look, I think we've been clear and we'll continue to be clear that our focus has been and will continue to be on passing the grid modernization legislation that supports the extension of formula rates to the 2032.","You heard me talk on the call about the significant benefits that it's brought to Illinois in terms of investment, reliability, jobs and still affordable. And so we think, and this is why this has been extended twice and it's why it's received such favorable votes in the committees, in both the Senate and the house. And we're hoping that the legislature takes it up because we think it would be a good thing for the state of Illinois for many years to come.","So that's going to continue to be our primary focus. There's no doubt that there are several other legislative proposals being looked at in the state of Illinois. Very, comprehensive, very complex and so the only thing I can say is that Richard Mark and his team are at the table speaking with all these stakeholders trying to sort through all the details, including Vistra's proposal.","So it would be premature for me to speculate just exactly where those proposals are, all the pros and the cons. The only thing I can tell you is that they're complicated, they're complex. They're big bills and that, doesn't mean that they won't be considered either in the veto session or next year. The only thing, rest assured we're at the table.","Gregory Gordon ","Okay Warner, thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Sophie Karp","Hi. Good morning guys.","Warner Baxter","Hello. Morning.","Sophie Karp","So a couple of questions if I may. First, I wanted to follow-up on the solar plus battery projects that you discussed and I was wondering if, you looked at other applications of battery storage technology at this point, maybe replacing picking generation capacity or even addressing the one with some of those transmission interconnection issues that you discussed. Is that a potential solution to transmission interconnection costs?","Warner Baxter","So, Michael, why don't you talk a little bit about this innovative project that we're doing in Missouri and then we can talk a little bit more. Shawn, you can weigh in on some of the things on the transmission side.","Michael Moehn","Yes. Again, these are, exclusively focused on the distribution side. So, again, looked and found places within our system that we need to make some reliability enhancements and combining these two projects together to make those reliability improvements in lieu of traditional sort of substation investments. My sense is, and Sean can comment on this, with respect whether those kind of applications are available on the transmission side as well.","Shawn Schukar","Yeah, this is Shawn, on the transmission side, we do look across the system to see where there are alternatives just like Michael was describing on the distribution side. And, and continue to look for those, as we look for solutions to enable both reliability improvements on the system and those generating generator interconnection.","Warner Baxter","Yes. So look at the bottom line is energy storage is something that we as a company look very carefully at per variety of different reasons. And, and we're pleased that we're \u2013 we'll look forward to having a conversation with the stake holders in Missouri on this Missouri project and we're going to continue to kick the tires on energy storage is probably, because this is, as I think we all know the costs continue to come down. There are various applications and so we'll continue to put our innovative efforts forward to see if we can actually do some of these projects for the benefit of our customers.","Sophie Karp","Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill","Good morning, Gregg. Thank you. You spoke a little bit about the lag, in between cases on I guess the gaps in the PISA mechanism and I was wondering if it's possible to, scale that impact or quantify it in some way, how you're thinking about it.","Marty Lyons","Yes, Greg, this is Marty. Hey, thanks for the question. I don't know that I have a way to really, scale it, our objective and walking through those piece of mechanics was really just to help you and investors understand some of the nuances of the accounting rate making, because we still do receive a number of questions about it in the context of the need for this current rate review and the next one to incorporate the wins.","So, look bottom line is, as you know this piece is really been a big step forward for us in terms of improving the Missouri regulatory framework for infrastructure investment. We've significantly increased our ongoing and planned investment, so it's really terrific. It's really, I guess to say again, there's a small amount of lag in terms of the rate making. That's for the 15% that doesn't get PISA deferrals.","And then we have this delayed recognition of equity earnings due to the accounting for the piece of deferrals and that needs to be understood. Today we're booking those, debt returns at about a 5% rate. So, that may help you in terms of some of your modeling, and as we stated, we're going to continue to manage the business in terms of cost management, and regulatory rate reviews to earn as close to the allowed returns as possible.","While as I said earlier, being mindful of operating and business needs. So, I think Greg, those are the components that we wanted to communicate and lay out and hopefully you can use that to help with your modeling.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you.","Marty Lyons","You're welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Kalton","Hi Guys. Good morning. Quick question just to clarify on new wins, so as you're evaluating and thinking about it, so ex the RCP would you will necessarily have to go be a part of the IRP process or not necessarily?","Michael Moehn","Good Morning Neil. It's Michael Moehn, I\u2019ll answer that question. Yes, I think as Warner stated earlier, I mean as we think about the future and think about future opportunities, it's really going to be part of that integrated resource planning process that we have here in the state of Missouri. And so those renewable opportunities will be, considered in the context of that again, we are complying with the Missouri renewable standard with the 700 megawatts and the $1.2 billion investment today. So future investments are really going to be contemplated in the IRP.","Warner Baxter","Neil I'll just add to this and you broke up a little bit at the front-end. Of course, the renewable choice program though is different. That would be outside of, that's a separate program that's been approved by Missouri Public Service Commission. And we already talked about that in the past, so just want to clarify that.","Neil Kalton","Perfect. Thank you.","Warner Baxter","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Andrew Kirk for closing comments.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you for participating in this call. A replay of this call will be available for one year on our website. If you have questions, you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Again, thank you for your interest in Ameren. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Doug Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Fischer, you may begin.","Doug Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com Web site homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.","As noted on page two of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued today and the forward-looking statements and risk factors sections in our filings with the SEC.","Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner, who will start on page four of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Doug. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our customers who experienced outages over the last several weeks due to some severe storms. I'm grateful for your patience and the support of our coworkers who are working hard to restore your service in very hot inhuman weather conditions. Of course, I also want to express my appreciation to our coworkers who have been tirelessly working through these difficult conditions for our Missouri and Illinois customers. Our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions. Again, my thanks to all of you.","Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced strong second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared to earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth of $0.18 per share was driven by the factors outlined on this page, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. It was particularly satisfying to me is that our strong growth was driven by the solid execution of our strategy across our entire business. I'm also pleased to report that as a result of this execution, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 improvement over our prior guidance.","This updated guidance excludes an expected third quarter non-cash estimated charge of $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the result of revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate, effective July 1st of this year. Beyond this charge, we expect this tax increase to have no material impact on consolidated earnings prospectively. Marty will also address this matter in more detail in a moment.","Moving to page five, here we reiterate our strategic plan. The year-over-year earnings growth, I just mentioned, reflects the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers as illustrated on the right side of this page. We continued to strategically allocate capital to our transmission and distribution businesses where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair predictable and timely cost recovery. This, along with our continued disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions, is expected to result in long term earnings growth that is superior to our regulated peers.","I'd like to discuss some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards execution of our strategy. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested more than $640 million or almost two-thirds of our capital expenditures in jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. This included about $290 million of capital for FERC regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO approved Illinois Rivers project, which is now about 90% complete with four of its nine line segments energized, including two of three river crossings and with all 10 substations and servers.","For the five remaining line segments are in the advanced stages of construction, with two those line segments to be completed by the end of this year, and river project remains on schedule for completion in 2019. At our second MISO approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, 85% of pool foundations are complete. Pool installation is now underway and the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.","Moving to our third MISO approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there have been several recent developments. As we discuss on our first quarter call, ATXI has proposed an alternative route for the project that replace more than 90% of the line on existing transmission line corridors. To accomplish this, ATXI has reached agreements in principle with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri to locate the new line on existing rights of way. This alternative route significantly minimizes the impact to landowners, communities and existing farmland, has been endorse by various agricultural and economic development groups and is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project costs.","In June, ATXI along with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and the Ameren Missouri posted a series of open-house meetings to obtain public input on the proposed alternative route to help finalize by adoptions. Feedback so far has been positive, and we are working to obtain needed county assents for both crossings. Upon receiving all five count assents, ATXI will request a certificate of convenience and necessity for this route to Missouri PSC. We look forward to continue to work with landowners and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Mid-West region moving forward. The planned in-service date is late 2019.","We also continued to invest in Ameren Illinois\u2019s local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace an aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remains strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.","Moving on to our other businesses. We invested about $350 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects during the first half of this year. These investments include Natural Gas Distribution projects that upgrade our gas infrastructure and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Through the end of June, Ameren Illinois has installed 516,000 smart electric meters and 278,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.","Ameren Illinois expects to saw another 185,000 smart electric meters and 76,000 gas meter modules in the second half of 2017, as works to deploy these two all this 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers by the end of 2019.","Turning now to page six for a Missouri business update. As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1st of this year as a result of unanimous agreement resolving all the issues in the rate review. Again, we appreciate the corporative effort of all parties involved. In concerted unanimous agreement a positive constructive step forward. In addition to successfully executing our rate review, we continued to effectively manage our Missouri operations and earn solid returns. We are doing so by effectively managing our capital projects, as well as by keeping a very sharp eye on our operating costs.","We\u2019re also very focused on enhancing Missouri\u2019s regulatory framework. As you know, construction rate making in legislation was not passed by the Missouri General Assembly during this year\u2019s budget state of sessions as a result of pillow buster by a small group of state senators. Our legislation did not get across the finish line. We did make progress on several fronts, progress we will build upon going forward. That progress included constructive reports from the Senate Interim Committee and Missouri PSC that supported enhancing the Missouri regulatory framework. Those reports, coupled with growing avenues from around the country that indicates that modern energy policies that support investment in the energy grid are in the long-term best interest of customers and the economy, help grow the strong by partially support for legislation.","Looking ahead, we will leverage the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions, continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and work towards starting a constructive path forward to enhance Missouri\u2019s regulatory framework. I also expect that we that we will support another legislative initiative in 2018.","Turning to page seven. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust five year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results for 2021 is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We strongly believe that the energy grid will be increasingly more important as we believe that Ameren and our industry will be critical neighbors of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.","Further, we continue to believe it will be appropriate to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making investments that will position us for success. These include significant investments in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure that will result in safer and more secure energy grid that will enable us to meet our customers\u2019 rising energy needs and expectations. And we are making prudent decisions to close down coal fired generation resources at the end of their useful lives, including our Meramec center in 2022, as well as to invest in renewable energy to effectively transition our generation portfolio.","Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next 20 year integrated resource plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October of this year. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders. Consistent with this long-term view, by the end of 2021, we expect that nearly 75% of our rate base will be invested in transmission and distribution assets, while just 13% of our rate base will consist of coal fired generation.","In addition to making investments with an eye toward the future, we are also actively participating in proceeding for the Illinois Commerce Commission and Missouri PSC that are, among other things, setting appropriate regulatory programs and frameworks to adjust changes taking place in our industry. Bottom line is that we've taken steps today across the Board to position Ameren for success in 2017, the next five years, and the next decade and beyond. And is so doing continue to deliver superior value to our customers and you, our shareholders.","Turning now to page eight to conclude my remarks. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included 6% compound annual rate base growth in 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. As we stated previously, this plan is not contingent on passage of Missouri legislation. Also, in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year.","We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers and Ameren shares, continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which our Board has increased in each of the last three years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.1% results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy. And I'm firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Warner and good morning, everyone. Turning now to page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year ago quarter. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase.","Starting with Ameren Missouri, second quarter year-over-year earnings increased $0.11 from $0.38 to $0.49 per share. This improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1st, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. The earnings improvement also resulted from the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder early summer temperatures.","Next, Ameren Illinois electric distribution's second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. This largely reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition, resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulated rate making by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. Second quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois electric distribution also benefitted from increased infrastructure investments, as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulated rate making of 8.8% compared to 8.45% for the year ago quarter.","Turning to Ameren Transmission. Second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This was due to increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic rate making, partially offset by lower average allowed return on equity, which was 10.82% in 2017 compared to an average of 11.4% in the year ago quarter.","In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15 months refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of Missouri energy efficiency program under MEEIA.","We exclude MEEIA affects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. The sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap-day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased about 0.5%, excluding MEEIA affects in sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shutdown operations during the first quarter of 2016. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased 3%, primarily due to lower sales to a low, to a large low margin processor of agricultural products. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois. No matter the cost, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Job Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.","Moving to page 11 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we reaffirmed our GAAP guidance at $2.65 to $2.85 per share, which now includes an expected third quarter non-cash tax related charge of $0.06 per share, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 per share improvement over our prior guidance range, reflecting solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management.","This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. While July temperatures were much warmer than normal, we don\u2019t expect that this impact was significant enough to offset the very mild temperatures experienced during the first half of the year, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. Listed on this page are select earnings considerations that will affect the comparability of second half 2017 core earnings to last year\u2019s second half results. Some of the larger impacts included change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution business and assumed return to normal temperatures of fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, the absence of 2016 Ameren Missouri energy efficiency performance incentives, the 2017 Ameren Missouri electric rate review settlement and increased transmission and electric distribution infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois.","I want to particularly call your attention to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, because it is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and increase earnings by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Finally, I would like to discuss the impact on Ameren of the recently enacted increase in Illinois\u2019 Corporate Income tax rate. Early last month, the Illinois General Assembly approved budget related legislation that effectively increased the corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% as of July 1st of this year. The tax increase is expected to result in a third quarter 2017 non-core non-cash charge of an estimated $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company due to revaluation of deferred taxes. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material impact on our consolidated earnings prospectively. The tax increase is not expected to materially impact earnings of Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution or Ameren Illinois\u2019 and ATXI\u2019s transmission businesses, since they operate under formulaic rate making.","The tax increase is expected to reduce Ameren Illinois\u2019 gas distribution business earnings, but only by approximately $1 million annually until customer rates are reset in the next rate review. And we plan to file for a gas distribution rate review in Illinois in early 2018 with new customer rates to be effective in early 2019.","Turning now to page 12 for an update on 2017 long-term debt financings. On June 15th, Ameren Missouri issued $400 million of 2.95% senior secured notes due 2027. The proceeds of which were used in connection with the repayment at maturity of $425 million of 6.4% senior secured notes. Also, ATXI agreed to privately place $450 million of 3.43% senior unsecured notes due 2050, $150 million of such notes were issued on June 22nd with the remaining $300 million to be issued on August 31st. The proceeds of the ATXI private placement will be used to repay Ameren parent for a portion of ATXI\u2019s existing intercompany debt. This is the first time ATXI has issued external debt, and we are pleased with the successful low cost issuance, including the strong investment grade credit rating the notes received. Finally, we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt later this year to repay at maturity $250 million of 6.125% senior secured notes and short-term debt.","Moving now to page 13 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In July, Ameren Illinois updated its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, requesting $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This is consistent with the ICC\u2019s stats file testimony and other parties did not file revenue requirement testimony. And ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year.","Turning to the FERC, one complaint case remains that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. These businesses are currently earning 10.82% ROE, including a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and will continue to do so pending any change required by the FERC as a result of this case. Our updated guidance assumes this ROE continues through the end of the year. While the U.S. Senate's approval yesterday of two new commissioners reestablishes a quorum at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule on the pending complaint case.","In addition to facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit that vacated the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as this court ruling may influence the FERC's order in the pending MISO ROE complaint case.","Turning to page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate base growth in disciplined financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up and re-queue for any additional [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","So just on the earnings revision for '17. So we -- is the new base to gross off of is the midpoint of that number, which is like 280 that kind of how to think about it?","Marty Lyons","Andy, obviously, the guidance we gave in terms of our long term earnings guidance has been really based on 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth from 2016 to 2020. Of course when we started that, we used to base in 2016 of 263, which was an adjusted base. Clearly, you're right. I mean as we look at this year, we've upped our guidance for our core earnings, the midpoint is 280. And as we think about going in next year any kind of long term guidance we give, yes, the foundation would be whatever the core earnings were for the prior year. So that would be -- that very well maybe the 280, going forward.","Andy Levi","And what's the difference between the mid-point in 290 just thinking, because I mean it's August in revenue. So obviously you\u2019re through the 290 in there for a reason, and must be achievable. So what is the delta that gets you to 290 versus 280?","Marty Lyons","Well, when you say that, obviously, as we go through the remainder of the year, we don\u2019t have, for example in there, any kind of July whether that\u2019s been baked in. And then you\u2019re really asking, I think, about the range and what justifies the range up or down.","Andy Levi","Or what gets you to, 280 is your midpoint. But what would get you to 290, I mean, what\u2019s in the thinking that gets you to 290\u2026","Marty Lyons","It\u2019s quite anything else for the remainder of the year. To the extent that there were sales volume changes, as I mentioned, we don\u2019t include in our guidance typically include normal weather, certainly there could be some weather impact up or down. We have had some warm weather here in July, which is an exclusively factored in. As I mentioned on the call, we don\u2019t expect that to offset the negative impacts of weather from earlier this year. And probably as we sit here today, it\u2019s probably less than $0.05 impact from what we\u2019re seen in July. But things like sales trends, reductions in operations and maintenance spending, positive weather, those for the kinds of things that can really move you up or down within your range.","Andy Levi","And are you trending towards the mid-point or the high-end right now? But you don\u2019t have to answer, I just\u2026","Marty Lyons","Look, we give a range. We feel comfortable with that range. And look, we started the year with a little bit lower. As we move through the year, we started the year with a little bit of negative weather that was certainly influencing our thinking at the beginning of the year in terms of the guidance range we gave. As we\u2019ve moved through the year, we\u2019ve had a constructive outcome in the Missouri rate case, which was terrific. We\u2019ve got disciplined financial management as we move through the year too, making sure we keep tight control of our costs. As you know, our goal in each one of our jurisdictions is to earn as close to our lab returns as we can. And we\u2019re executing on our strategy well, deploying the capital as we expected to, which drives rate base growth, which drives earnings growth. So we\u2019re executing well. We feel comfortable with raising the overall range. And obviously, work hard to achieve year-end results within that range.","Warner Baxter","And it is Warner. I would just simply say -- I would just say one thing as Marty said. I think it\u2019s simply evidence of the fact that we\u2019re executing our plan and we\u2019re executing it well, and we\u2019re executing across all of our businesses.","Andy Levi","And then I know I\u2019m going to achieve you announced one extra question. But if you kind of -- and I know you haven\u2019t given any key guidance and I am not expecting you to. But just very simplistically, 280 is the mid-point of where we\u2019re going to grow off of. And then you don\u2019t have a Callaway outage next year right at $0.09 to $0.10 to $0.18. Is that correct?","Marty Lyons","The Callaway outage is around $0.08. But you\u2019re right we don\u2019t have one next year. Look, we\u2019re not giving guidance for next year. But as you look ahead to next year, we certainly expect to benefit from the continued investments we\u2019re making in rate base, which drive earnings growth. We don\u2019t have the Callaway outage next year as you mentioned, which also then would be additive to earnings.","Andy Levi","Well, you don\u2019t have a Callaway outage and then you\u2019re not filing a rate case in Missouri, right? Probably some interest expense savings from that you\u2019ll capture in 2018 plus you get about $0.20 of growth in Illinois just from a rate base growth. So I\u2019m just looking at consensus around $3 and this adding up the numbers, so to see some -- the people were underestimating your earnings power. I don\u2019t know if you tend to agree with that, and I guess you saw this year too without obviously giving guidance.","Marty Lyons","Again, we\u2019re not giving guidance for next year, and I won\u2019t comment on consensus for next year either. And I also wouldn\u2019t comment on necessarily the EPS impacts that you gave from the rate base growth, and then we\u2019ll provide our guidance as we normally do as we roll into the early part of next year. I would mention that you mentioned no Missouri rate case filing. The one think I would mention is on the rate review that we just concluded where the rates went into effect April 1st, this year, we realized about 75% to 80% of the impact of that rate review. Next year, we would incrementally pick up the first quarter benefit of that rate review.","Andy Levi","Plus any refinancings that you have, because you have some high cost debt that\u2019s coming due at union and that obviously would have to get back in a future rate case, but not in \u201818. Is that correct?","Marty Lyons","To the extent that we\u2019re able to, Ameren Missouri, to refinance the debt at a lower rate, we do benefit from that savings until the next rate review. And to your point on that, I mentioned on the call that in June we refinanced, we paid off $425 million of 6.4% debt, issued $400 million at 2.95%, and so 10 year offering. That for example is about $15 million of annual interest savings.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Quick question on Missouri, and Warner you commented a little bit about changing generation fleet. You\u2019re one of the few utilities in the region that has not really, when you look at generation supply, benefited both by sizable in Missouri Transmission growth that leads to a sizable amount of wind generation, entering your service territory and maybe replacing some possible generation. Can you talk a little bit about whether you see that as a significant opportunity either via owning wind plants in rate base or in the need for incremental transmission in Missouri to be able to connect to the West where there is lots of great winds resource? And can you talk about what do you need from a regulatory standpoint, either rate making or approval wise, taxing make that happen if that\u2019s one of the decisions you make going forward?","Warner Baxter","Thanks Michael for your question, and a couple of comments. Number one, we are in the process we look at the transmission but we also look at generation. And we\u2019ve been consistent in saying that we\u2019re going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse claim portfolio. But we\u2019re doing it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we\u2019re going to update our integrated resource plan and that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space, just with regard to our own generation. And as we know, we have renewable energy standard in the State of Missouri. And as a result of that, as renewable energy cost for new generation comes down that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look carefully at.","Of course, to make renewable energy work you need to make sure that you have a transmission system that\u2019s robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we have certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois and in MISO, we\u2019ve done some way of the Mark Twain project that we\u2019re going to hopefully continue to move forward with, and get across the finish line. So as you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some opportunities for incremental transmission that could be done, whether it's done on a multi-value project basis, which would have to go through MISO or potentially of course something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri.","And so I wouldn\u2019t say that we certainly rule that out, we see that as an opportunity. So I'm looking at Shawn Schukar, and Sean in terms of how you look at the space, especially MISO and other things. We do see the incremental transmission opportunities that does support generation, but even just to deal with and to support liability projects and those types of things?","Shawn Schukar","Warner, that's correct. We see significant opportunities around the opportunity to improve or to replace the existing transmission system in Illinois and Missouri, but overlaying that with as we see changing generation portfolios in the market that that will create potential new opportunities, especially given the strong wind resources to our west.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Can you just delve a little more deeply into the Missouri process, and how you can possibly get more traction there? I'm talking legislative.","Warner Baxter","I'll comment on that, Michael feel free to jump in. As we said before, of course, we've been disappointed that we haven't got that across the finish line. But you know that the process in legislation is always one of collaboration; it's always one of working with key stakeholders to educate them on the needs; and it's always one of ensuring they understand the real value to modernizing the energy grid.","Now, if you look at what we've been able to do in Illinois that's really the formula that we worked we over there, it's making sure everyone understood the value. And then once you have them understand the value, you deliver on those projects. And it's clear what we've seen in Illinois, and what we've seen frankly across the country as that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid not only brings real value to customers it keeps rates still affordable, but it creates thousands of jobs that's been formula that's worked across the country, and we can see has worked clearly in Illinois.","So that same message is resonating in the State of Missouri. It's why we have such strong by partisan support that's why the collaborative effort that we've been working on continued to gather even more stakeholders to support it. So it really is one of just doing the work on the ground to work on with collaborating with key stakeholders and being mindful that the approach that we've been taking is very consistent with where Governor Greitens has said that, look, regulatory reform is an important part of his platform to become Governor, as well as creating good paying jobs. We've been talking about the State of Missouri is absolutely consistent with that. So I think that has been their approach. And Michael, you've been on the ground working with key stakeholders, anything there?","Michael Moehn","I think that's well said. The only thing I would add to that and just a couple of things. We're going to continue to build off of certainly the interim report that the Senate put out last fall along with the Missouri Public Service Commission had the working docket then on looking at issues around regulatory reform. There has also been an emerging issues task force that they\u2019ve kicked off here. We\u2019re going to have some more meetings here in August. All of these are indications and I think they understand that we need to take a different approach to this. There is opportunities around and we\u2019re going to continue to leverage those, going forward.","Paul Ridzon","If it comes down to one party, right. I mean how do you flip them?","Warner Baxter","So at the end of the day, Paul, this is Warner again. We do what we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019d continue to work collaboratively with those key stakeholders. And we have a small group that has opposed the legislation but we won\u2019t be deter, because look it\u2019s important for us to continue to get their input, we share our input with them. And as we\u2019ve said before, while we expands the filibuster, there are certainly ways to no way find compromises in advance but in the context the filibusters and like, look the key is you continue to reduce the number of people that may want to participate in the filibuster. Number one, you make sure, you\u2019re given adequate floor time and try and make sure you can address those issues and hopefully come to a compromise. And lastly, as we\u2019ve said before, I mean there are rules in the sense that that would enable to close down the debate. But those rules aren\u2019t used often. We hope we never get to that point. The bottom line is we want board collaboratively with everybody to ultimately get constructive legislation that benefits our customers, the communities that we serve and our shareholders.","Michael Moehn","Yes, that\u2019s right, Warner. I think that this may sound na\u00efve at the end of the day. But we just -- we actually have to convince them of the value associated with us. There are too many examples them. Warner talked about what\u2019s going to in Illinois but you can certainly look far beyond in Illinois in terms of what\u2019s happening in terms of modernizing the grid and the value they create for customers and shareholders at the end of the day. And so we just, honestly, have to continue to double down that effort to convince them that the State of Missouri is falling behind, if we don\u2019t makes in progress on this.","Paul Ridzon","Are there any terminal mix to consider here?","Warner Baxter","In Missouri, there are terminal mix, yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel LLC. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Fallon","I just wanted to follow-up on Michael Lapides\u2019 question, and specifically on the wind. Are you guys able to sign PPAs, or do new builds on wind generation with economics below the dispatch costs of your coal fleet?","Marty Lyons","Yes, I mean in terms of moving forward, clearly, there could be PPAs we enter into. We could own wind generation, both of those are viable options. And in terms of that question, I mean there is a couple of ways that it could happen prospectively; one, as you mentioned is to the extent that the all-in costs of those renewables was below the dispatch costs of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn\u2019t been as great here as maybe other places is that the dispatch costs of our existing generation is pretty low. And it\u2019s a real benefit for our customers.","However, the cost of renewables continues to come down and we watch those economics very closely. As Warner mentioned in this answer to Michael earlier, as part of the integrated resource plan, we also look at compliance with the Missouri renewable energy standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of and native sales from renewables by 2021, subject though to 1% annual limit on rates. And really that\u2019s been limiter historically in term of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio.","In our 2014 IRP, we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we\u2019re working on an update to that integrated resource plan. And in answer to your question, we\u2019re both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation, but also looking at it in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So those are the two ways that really as we look ahead there is the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio.","Kevin Fallon","And where are you relative to that 15% by 2020 right now in terms of your fleet?","Marty Lyons","In terms of the existing assets that we have with things under purchased, we\u2019re below that, significantly below that. But there are a few ways to go about compliance; one is PPAs; one is ownership; and the other is renewable energy credit. So we\u2019re looking at all options as we move ahead for compliance with that standard.","Kevin Fallon","And just one last thing. In terms of the process, going forward, obviously, you guys have said that you\u2019re going to seek legislation again next year in Missouri. But is there any possibility of trying to do something at the commission before with the billion dollars of grid monetization CapEx that you guys have highlighted in the past? Or is that something that you\u2019re just going to defer and try and seek the legislation itself only?","Michael Moehn","Also on the respect to your question on that renewables and where we are, I believe we\u2019re right at around 5% today in terms of that 15% compliance.","Marty Lyons","With respect to the legislative question regulatory, look I think we\u2019re not obviously foreclosing any tools available to us. I think we look at a number of options that we can pursue. As Warner indicated, we certainly intend to file, as we sit here today, legislation but we\u2019re going to continue to look at all options to continue to make progress here. And we\u2019ve used regulatory tools in the past that are being constructive. So it is certainly an option available for us.","Kevin Fallon","Is there a certain timeframe that you\u2019re looking to make a decision on that before the legislation? Or is it just a general sense that you always make those types of calculations?","Marty Lyons","More of the latter\u2026","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow up from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","So, on the renewables that was just brought up. So why wouldn\u2019t you guys do the majority of it yourself if there was the opportunity, and it was economical for rate bearers?","Marty Lyons","Andy, no disagreement with that assertion. I mean, certainly, if that makes the most sense for the customers that would be a positive. So we\u2019ll need to look at as we are as we\u2019re assessing it, what the best compliance option is for the renewable energy standard for our customers, and looking at the various options and thinking about the benefits, risks, cost of all of those options.","Andy Levi","And what\u2019s the timeframe of that, because obviously things are getting closed here. So what's the timeframe? When will we hear about the decision making process on that?","Michael Moehn","As Warner indicated, we have an IRP that needs to be filed in October. So my sense is that we'll have some communication right around that timeframe.","Andy Levi","And obviously, you don't have anything in your current CapEx forecast for any of this?","Warner Baxter","Very little on the current CapEx forecast for that, given as I mentioned earlier, the IRP we had a few years ago, 2014 had about 130 megawatts of wind by 2021.","Andy Levi","And how much gains from that 5% to the 20% I think you said, with the standard. How many megawatts are we talking about?","Marty Lyons","Well, it's really again limited by the 1%. And I think rather than getting into that here, something we're assessing. And as Michael said when we file the IRP in October, we'll see where we're at.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Doug Fischer for any closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for your questions today. As we discussed today, we believe the Ameren shares offer investors attractive total return potential based on our strong expected earnings growth outlook and solid dividend. Finally, let me remind you that a replay of this call will be available for one year on our Web site. If you've questions, please call the contacts listed on our earnings release.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that\u2019s accurate only as of the \u2013 of today\u2019s live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.","As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.","For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-looking Statements section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors section in our filings with the SEC.","Lastly, all per-share earnings amounts discussed during today\u2019s presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now, here\u2019s Warner, who\u2019ll start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced third quarter 2019 GAAP and core earnings, $1.47 per share, compared to 2018 core earnings of $1.50 per share. A summary of the key drivers of the third quarter year-over-year change in earnings per share is provided on Page 4. Marty will discuss these and other items in more detail a bit later.","Overall, we delivered solid results during the third quarter. From an operations standpoint, our team continues to perform very well, and we continue to execute on all elements of our strategy, which includes significant investments in energy infrastructure and disciplined cost management. I\u2019ll share my perspectives on the progress we\u2019ve made in executing key elements of our strategy during the whole third quarter in a moment.","Due to the strong execution of our strategy, I\u2019m pleased to report that we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $3.23 to $3.33 per share from our initial 2019 guidance range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. In so doing, we are raising the guidance midpoint $0.03 per share from $3.25 to $3.28 per share.","Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we expect continued delivery in significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. First pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers and jurisdictions that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks.","As we have discussed with you in the past, all 4 of our business segments have constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in energy infrastructure. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments. You may recall, it was in the third quarter of last year that Ameren Missouri began using plant and service accounting, enabled by Senate Bill 564. Enactment of Senate Bill 564 improved our ability to earn a fair return while making significant infrastructure investments for the benefit of our customers.","Consequently, capital expenditures at Ameren Missouri are up approximately 15% in the first 9 months of this year versus the comparable period in 2018. Consistent with the Ameren Missouri smart energy plan, we are putting meaningful dollars to work to modernize the energy grid. For example, as of the end of September, we\u2019ve installed 120 distributed automated switches. We placed or upgraded 6 substations and installed 15,000 fortified polls. And speaking of making progress, in Illinois, we are on track to complete the installation of over 1.2 million electric chart meters and over 830,000 gas modules by year-end. Installation of these important tools for our customers will be completed ahead of schedule and on budget. In our transmission business, we are on track to finish the Mark Twain Multi-Value Project by the end of this year.","Looking ahead, there is much more to come in the way of energy infrastructure investments in all of our segments, which will deliver long-term value to our customers and the communities we serve.","We have a vast energy transmission and distribution system that we will continue to prudently and systematically invest in. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to transition our generation portfolio to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. That transition will include significant investments in renewable energy, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail in a moment. And we will continue to invest in advanced technologies, including digital technologies, to meet our customers\u2019 rising expectations.","Of course, as we make these investments, it is important that we continue to be focused on keeping rates affordable and competitive. And we\u2019re doing just that.","Our pending Ameren Missouri Electric rate review request for a $1 million decrease in annual electric revenues demonstrates that focus. Similarly, in late August, the Missouri PSC issued an order approving a $1 million annual revenue decrease in the Ameren Missouri Natural Gas rate review. And just last month, administrative law judges recommended a decrease in Ameren Illinois\u2019 annual electric formula rate update, consistent with Ameren Illinois\u2019 request of $7 million.","In addition, we continue to make significant investments in Missouri and Illinois and robust energy efficiency programs that allow our customers to better manage their energy usage and control their overall energy costs. These programs are delivering significant results.","These rate review filings, coupled with our robust energy efficiency programs, demonstrate that we are clearly focused on keeping our customers\u2019 rates competitive and affordable, while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure to improve service to our customers and drive earnings growth for our shareholders.","Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which focuses on enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Earlier this year, constructive electric grid modernization legislation that would extend electric formula ratemaking through 2032, while widely supported was not brought to a vote before full Illinois general assembly due to other legislative matters taking priority during this year\u2019s general session.","To date, this important grid modernization legislation has not been addressed during the veto session which is scheduled to end on November 14. If not addressed during the veto session, we will continue to support extension of electric formula ratemaking in the future.","Shifting to Missouri. I\u2019m pleased to report that last month, we received Missouri PSC approval for the next phase of our Charge Ahead Program, which will bring significantly more electric vehicle charging stations to our service territory. This program provides incentives to develop electric vehicle charging stations along highways and in communities throughout Ameren Missouri\u2019s service territory.","The program is expected to drive the installation of over 1,000 charging ports at more than 350 locations to enable long-distance vehicle travel, reduce range anxiety and incur electrification of the transportation sector.","This program is consistent with our focus on reducing economy-wide carbon emissions to address risks and concerns over climate change and to meet our customers\u2019 rising energy needs and expectations. Of course, we\u2019re doing our part in driving down carbon emissions in many ways, which leads me to an update on the third pillar of our strategy, which includes creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment that will benefit our customers and shareholders.","On Page 6 of our presentation, we outlined our investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri\u2019s Renewable Energy Standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. Specifically, we have 2 build transfer agreements in place for 700 megawatts of new wind generation. We expect our investment in these projects to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is $200 million above the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year for our wind generation investment.","I\u2019m also pleased to report that we now have all regulatory approvals for these 2 projects and both interconnection agreements have been executed. Construction is also now underway on these 2 important renewable energy projects for the state of Missouri. Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio and expected to be in service by the end of next year. We expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments.","At this time, these investments are also expected to fulfill our 2021 compliance needs under Missouri\u2019s renewable energy standard. Consistent with our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities for the benefit of our customers in the context of our next comprehensive-integrated resource plan which we plan to file in September 2020.","Before moving on, and while discussing our generation portfolio, I\u2019d like to provide an update on litigation regarding Ameren Missouri\u2019s past compliance with the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. As you may recall, this litigation dates back to 2011 when the Department of Justice, on behalf of the APA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri alleging them at performing certain projects at the Rush Island Energy Center. We violated the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act.","In 2017, the District Court issued a liability ruling, and in September 2019, ordered the installation of Pollution Control equipment at the Rush Island Energy Center as well as at the Labadie Energy Center. We believe in [reaching] this liability and remedying the decisions, the district court both misinterpreted and misapplied the law on several accounts.","As a result, we immediately filed a stay of this decision with the District Court and appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the eighth circuit. Recently, the District Court granted a stay of the majority of its order, which will help us to avoid unnecessary and costly expenditures for our customers while the case is on appeal. We strongly believe that we have complied with the Clean Air Act, and we look forward to presenting our arguments to the Court of Appeals. Based on the initial procedural schedule, all arguments are expected to be heard in 2020. However, the Court of Appeals is under no deadline to issue a ruling in this case.","Turning now to Page 7. I\u2019d like to expand a bit more on how we are leaning forward on a host of innovative programs and investments to deliver a brighter and cleaner energy future, consistent with our customers\u2019 energy needs and rising expectations. As I\u2019ve said before, our customers are at the center of our strategy. In addition to the robust energy infrastructure investments we are making to modernize the energy grid, our customers are asking for innovative programs and investments to enhance reliability and produce cleaner forms of energy at affordable and competitive costs as well as to enable them to better manage their energy usage. As you can see on this page, we are listening to our customers.","In addition to the Charge Ahead Program and 700 megawatts of wind generation, I spoke about earlier, we are investing in innovative technologies and have developed several programs to help bring clean energy to the grid and our customers. These include Ameren Missouri\u2019s Neighborhood Solar Program, Community Solar Program, Renewable Choice Program and Solar + Storage, in addition to robust energy efficiency programs in Missouri and Illinois.","I\u2019ll briefly touch on a few of these programs now. Our Renewable Choice Program allows large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities to elect to receive up to 100% of their energy from renewable resources. This program enables us to supply customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation, up to 200 megawatts of which we could own. We are currently in the process of reviewing wind generation projects for this program and soliciting binding interest from customers. We don\u2019t expect any projects associated with this program to go into service until 2021. We will give you a more comprehensive update during our year-end conference call next February.","Our Community Solar Program allows the residential and small business customers to elect to enroll for up to half of their average annual energy usage to participate in the solar generation. This program launched in the fall of 2018 and quickly reached full subscription. Based on customer demand, we plan to file a request with the Missouri PSC to expand the program in 2020 from 1 megawatt to 7 megawatts.","During our second quarter call, we discussed the 3 10-megawatt Solar + Storage facilities. These facilities will be the first of their kind in the state and designed to meaningfully enhance reliability for our customers in a cost-effective manner. We have already filed for a certificate of convenience and necessity with the Missouri PSC and expect a decision by the first quarter of 2020.","In summary, we believe that the robust energy infrastructure investment plans that I described earlier, coupled with these and other innovative customers\u2019 programs will help create a smarter, cleaner and more reliable and resilient integrated energy grid that will deliver a brighter energy future for our customers and the communities we serve.","Moving now to Page 8. We believe that the execution of our strategy in 2019 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2018-2023 period, using 2018 weather-normalized core earnings per share as a base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by expected 8% compound annual rate base growth over the same period.","As I noted earlier, we have a strong pipeline of investments in each of our jurisdictions that will deliver value to our customers. In addition, we will continue to advocate for constructive regulatory frameworks and energy policies to support these important investments for the future. We will provide an update on our 5-year capital plan during our earnings call next February.","Finally, our strong earnings growth expectation positions us well for future dividend growth. Last month, Ameren\u2019s Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by over 4%, the sixth consecutive year with a dividend increase. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, which currently provides a yield of approximately 2.7%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to Marty, I\u2019d like to touch on the executive rotation announced last month. Effective December 1, Marty, currently our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and President of Ameren Services, will become President of Ameren Missouri; and Michael Moehn, currently President of Ameren Missouri will assume Marty\u2019s current responsibilities.","This rotation of responsibilities is consistent with Ameren\u2019s robust leadership development plan. I firmly believe this rotation will not only broaden our already strong work experiences but will also further strengthen our senior leadership expertise and better position us to execute our long-term strategic plan. I\u2019m sure that many of you know that, Marty and Michael have worked closely together for many years. And I am very confident that the transition would be seamless and that they will perform exceptionally well in their new roles, just as they have for almost 20 years as leaders at Ameren.","So in closing, we accomplished a great deal during the third quarter. Our operations and financial results were solid. Our investments are delivering results for our customers of keeping rates affordable and competitive, and we narrowed our 2019 earnings guidance while also increasing our guidance midpoint $0.03 per share.","Simply put, we are doing what we said we would do. We are delivering superior and long-term value for our customers, the communities we serve and you, our shareholders.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. On Page 11 of the presentation is a table outlining the GAAP to core earnings reconciliations. I\u2019ll simply note that there was a noncore charge in 2018, but no noncore activity in 2019.","Turning to Page 12 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, today, we reported third quarter 2019 GAAP and core earnings of $1.47 per share compared to core earnings of $1.50 per share for the year-ago quarter. Here, we highlight the key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.03 per share decrease. Earnings per share for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were down $0.02 compared to last year, driven by a lower-allowed return on equity due to a projected average 30-year treasury bond yield in 2019 compared to 2018.","This was partially offset by earnings on increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments. The expected allowed return on equity this year is 8.3% down from the 2018 average of 8.9%. The 2019 allowed ROE is based on an expected average 30-year treasury yield of 2.5% down from the 2018 average of 3.1%.","Ameren Illinois Natural Gas results decreased $0.01 due to a change in rate design, which was partially offset by earnings on increased infrastructure investments. The rate design change is not expected to impact full year results.","Ameren Parent results decreased $0.02 per share primarily due to timing of income tax expense, which is also not expected to impact full year results. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.02, reflecting increased infrastructure investments. And finally, Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, reported earnings that were comparable to prior year results. Ameren Missouri\u2019s 2019 earnings reflect EMEA performance incentive related to the 2016 energy efficiency plan, which contributed $0.05 per share. I am pleased to report that we met the energy-savings goals needed to earn the maximum performance incentive available under the 2016 EMEA plan. Ameren Missouri\u2019s earnings comparison also reflects the positive comparative impacts of timing differences in 2018 related to federal tax reform, which are not expected to impact full year earnings comparisons.","These favorable factors were mostly offset by lower-electric retail sales, which decreased earnings by an estimated $0.04 per share primarily due to milder mid-summer temperatures in this quarter compared to the year-ago period. However, I will note the cooling-degree days for the quarter were above normal, driven primarily by the month of September, which was the hottest on record for St. Louis.","Finally, Ameren Missouri\u2019s 2019 earnings reflect increased property tax expense due to higher-assessed values, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first 9 months of this year compared to the first 9 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased 0.5%, excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under EMEA. Kilowatt-hour sales to low-margin Missouri industrial customers decreased about 3% after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude EMEA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.","Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased about 2%, and kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois Industrial customers decreased 1%. Recall that these changes in electric sales in Illinois reflect the impacts of our robust energy efficiency programs and, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.","Moving then to Page 13 of our presentation. Despite the lower 30-year treasury yields discussed earlier, our year-to-date results are solidly on track. As Warner noted, due to the solid execution of our strategy, we narrowed our 2019 earnings guidance to a range of $3.23 to $3.33 per share, increasing the midpoint by $0.03. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page.","I will not comment specifically on these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and consistent with the 2019 earnings drivers and assumptions discussed on our February earnings call and the balance of your considerations outlined on our second quarter call.","Moving now to Page 14 for a discussion of select regulatory matters, starting with Ameren Missouri. As you will recall, on July 3, we filed for a $1 million revenue decrease with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.95% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a December 31, 2019 estimated rate base of $8 billion. It is based on the 2018 test year with certain pro-forma adjustments through the end of 2019 and January 1, 2020. Intervenor testimony will be filed in early December with responsive testimony filed in early 2020. Absent a comprehensive settlement, evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in early March 2020. A Missouri PSC decision is expected by late April 2020, with new rates expected to be effective by late May.","Regarding our Ameren Missouri natural gas rate review, a Missouri PSC decision was issued in late August for a $1 million annual revenue reduction and new rates were effective on September 1. While this was a black box settlement, it specifically provides for the use of the actual Missouri capital structure as of May 31, 2019, of 52% equity and a range of reasonable-allowed ROE of 9.4% to 9.95%, including the use of 9.725% for the infrastructure rider.","Finally, last week, we requested Missouri PSC approval for a change to the way we account for scheduled Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage expenses. If the request is approved prior to the fall 2020 outage, we expect to defer the maintenance expenses incurred related to the outage and begin amortizing those expenses over approximately 18 months after completion of the outage. We believe this change would allow the timing of expense recognition associated with these outages to more closely align with the timing of related revenue recognition.","Moving to Page 15, in Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois\u2019 formula rate making, our Ameren Illinois utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs.","In October, the administrative law judges issued a proposed order consistent with Ameren Illinois\u2019 request. An ICC decision is expected in December, with new rates expected to be effective in January 2020. Finally, we expect to file a rate review with the ICC for our Ameren Illinois Natural Gas business in early 2020, using a future test year ending December 31, 2021.","Turning now to Page 16 for an update on notable financing activities that we would like to highlight. On August 5, we entered into an equity forward sale agreement to fund a portion of the 700-megawatt wind generation investment expected to be in service by the end of next year, with expected proceeds of $540 million to $550 million upon settlement. This was another important milestone for our wind generation investment. Settlement of the forward sale agreement is expected to occur as we close on the wind project acquisitions.","In addition, to take advantage of the decline in interest rates that occurred during the quarter, on September 16, Ameren Corporation issued $450 million of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2024. Proceeds of the issuance were used to repay short-term debt.","Finally, on October 1, Ameren Missouri issued $330 million of 3.25% first mortgage bonds due in 2049. This was the lowest rate for a 30-year bond issue in Ameren Missouri\u2019s history, which helps keep customer rates low as proceeds were used to repay at maturity $244 million, a 5.1% senior secured notes due October 1 as well as to repay short-term debt.","Lastly, Ameren Illinois is expected to issue long-term debt by the end of this year.","Moving now to Page 17. We plan to provide 2020 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2019 year-to-date results and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about the earnings outlook for next year.","Beginning with Missouri, we expect new electric service rates to be implemented in 2020 as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and return on new infrastructure investments, lower-fuel and transportation costs as well as more recent sales and other costs, which collectively are expected to increase earnings when compared against 2019.","I would note that due to the excellent results stemming from our robust energy efficiency programs for our customers, we earned strong performance incentives in Missouri in 2019. As a result, we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately $0.09 per share lower than 2019.","Further, we expect a return to normal weather in 2020 will decrease Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.02 compared to 2019 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year. Absent a Missouri PSC approval of our requested change in the way we account for Callaway scheduled refueling and maintenance outages which I discussed earlier, we expect expenses associated with the fall 2020 outage to be approximately $0.02 per share higher than those experienced for our spring 2019 outage and prospective outages. We are going to perform some additional maintenance activities for this fall 2020 outage that will result in the cost being approximately $0.11 per share versus $0.09 per share this year.","As previously noted, the 700 megawatts of wind generation are expected to be in service by the end of 2020. As a result, we expect to see contributions to earnings from these investments in 2021.","Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. Ameren Transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change, positive or negative, to the current-allowed ROE of 10.82%.","For Ameren Illinois Electric distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2020 compared to 2019 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois\u2019 formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE under the formula will be the average 2020 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%, which is applied to year-end rate base.","For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings are expected to benefit from an increase in infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment that will earn the current-allowed ROE of 9.87%.","Finally, the issuance of common shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings per share. Of course, in 2020, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible, while being mindful of operating and other business needs.","Turning to Page 18, I will summarize. We continue to expect to deliver strong weather-normalized earnings growth in 2019 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Our outlook includes a strong pipeline of investments, which allows us flexibility to manage headwinds as we look to deliver on our long-term earnings per share growth goals. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers.","In addition, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to our peers.","That concludes my prepared remarks. With that, we now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Julien.","Alex Morgan","It\u2019s actually Alex Morgan calling in for Julien. Congrats on the guide up in 2019 earnings. Marty, I have two quick questions. The first one, I was just hoping you might be able to confirm that you have not received the letter from the SEC or the FBI regarding any of your activities in Illinois, just thinking about some of your peers in the state?","Warner Baxter","Sure. Sure. This is Warner. So look, the simple answer to that question is no, on both counts. And just to be clear, in the normal course, we don\u2019t normally comment on litigation matters and subpoenas unless they\u2019re material or have a financial impact. But I recognize the sensitivity of this. And so I\u2019ll just reiterate again, no on both counts, period.","Alex Morgan","Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to ask that one quickly. And then the other question that I had was just a little bit on that 2020 driver slide that you had included. In Ameren Missouri, I know you talked a little bit about the $0.09 lower-energy efficiency performance. I was hoping you could delve into that a little bit more. Specifically, how we should be thinking about energy efficiency going forward? And also, for 2020, how should we be thinking about that being offset?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Alex. This is Marty. Let me talk a little bit about that. In 2019, we\u2019ve had a little bit of an unusually positive year in terms of MEEIA performance incentive benefits. In Q1, you may recall that we had about a $20 million benefit. And in Q3, we\u2019ve recognized another approximately $18 million benefit. So the total is about $38 million for the year or approximately $0.11, maybe a little over $0.11. And really, that\u2019s because of incentives related to 2 prior programs, both the 2013 program and the 2016 programs.","And in the quarter, we actually had, as I mentioned, in the third quarter, we have this $18 million benefit. And the range could have been anywhere from a target incentive of about $5 million up to the $18 million that was recognized, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, where we achieved the maximum under the program. So we actually had a fairly positive year. Just to give you a little bit of a sense of history, if you go back in time, in 2017, we had really no benefit. In 2018, I think it was about a $0.03 benefit. And then this year, we had, as I said, about $0.11 benefit. And like I said, it was something that was \u2013 could have been a range of 5 \u2013 $5 million to $18 million in Q3. So a bit of a positive benefit there relatively and versus expectations.","As you look ahead to next year, we roll into \u2013 we\u2019re into now, this year, the MEEIA 3, the third version of this energy efficiency program. And depending upon the performance under this first year, we expect that the benefits next year could be in the range of $7 million to $8 million. So down next year, which is why we\u2019re guiding at this point to about a $0.09 negative year-over-year.","But I just do want to highlight again that when you look at this year, the fact that we are raising guidance here in the quarter, raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.03, certainly part of our ability to do that is the performance incentive that we did earn in Q3 at that maximum level.","Alex Morgan","Thank you so much. have a great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Reiss with Centenus.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Reiss","Hey, congrats on a good quarter.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Greg Reiss","I was wondering, can you guys quantify this Callaway deferral request? I know that you\u2019ve embedded about $0.11 for next year as a headwind. But if you get this deferral, I guess, how much of that $0.11 would get pushed out and kind of spread over the next period?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Greg, this is Marty again. You\u2019re right. The outage next year, we\u2019re forecasting being about $0.11 outage. If the request we made is accepted by the commission, what we would expect then is that we would defer that $0.11 and then amortize it over approximately an 18-month period. So to a large extent, that $0.11 would be removed from earnings next year. There would be a little bit of amortization sort of at the end of next year.","But then, of course, the next year, when you roll around to 2021, when we otherwise \u2013 when we won\u2019t have an outage, that we would see approximately 2\/3 of an outage expense reflected in that year. So that\u2019s how we do it. I\u2019ll tell you, Greg, in terms of this ask we\u2019ve made of the commission, and it\u2019s really not a change in ratemaking per se, or revenue requirement. But I think what this would allow us to do is, over time, not have fluctuations in our earnings due to the timing of this Callaway outage and give us a smoother trajectory of earnings growth going forward. So that\u2019s part of the goal with respect to this ask.","Greg Reiss","Got you. And then would you envision this being something that you\u2019d be able to utilize to potentially help offset some of the headwinds you\u2019re experiencing from the 30-year treasury move down?","Marty Lyons","No, no, no. Not really specifically, Greg, in terms of that. I think that really, like I said, the thrust behind this is to, over time, have a more normalized level of growth over time and not have the sort of fluctuations associated with Callaway. If you look at what we did this year, Greg, I mean, just in terms of this 30-year treasury, this year, we went into the year thinking it was going to be about 3.1%, and we\u2019re booking to about 2.5%, so down about 60 basis points, which created this year about $0.04 of headwind.","As you heard today, we raised the midpoint of our guidance $0.03. A little bit of that is positive weather. We\u2019ve had a couple of cents of positive weather. We also had these MEEIA performance incentives I spoke to earlier, but also contributing to that ability to raise guidance at a disciplined cost control. As we look ahead towards the longer term and the growth that we\u2019re expecting, of 6% to 8%, look, the long-term guidance we\u2019ve given, 6% to 8% growth out through 2023, yields about a $0.40 earnings range out there in 2023. If you look at where we are from the beginning of this year until today from, say, a 3.1% treasury down to about a 2.4% today, it\u2019s about 70 basis points. We\u2019re talking about a nickel or so of earnings if those 2.4% treasury rates hold. A nickel, in and of itself, certainly, not going to move us outside that $0.40 range.","If we look to the longer term, we\u2019ve got a number of tools in our toolbox. We have actions we believe we can take, and we\u2019ve discussed many times that we\u2019ve got a very robust pipeline of capital investments that we can make over time. And certainly, a tool in our toolkit.","But bottom line is, Greg, that range we\u2019ve got out there accommodates a range of treasury rates, allowed returns on equity, spending levels, regulatory decisions, rate review timing, economic conditions, financing plans, et cetera. And we\u2019ll continue to take actions prospectively as we have in the past to deliver on our commitments.","Greg Reiss","Got you. Thank you very much.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","So I wanted to follow-up a little bit on Greg\u2019s question regarding the change in sort of the ROE in Illinois. And I\u2019m just wondering, I mean, you went over pretty well the sort of impact on EPS, in general. But just the difference in return versus other jurisdictions is pretty significant. And I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know you\u2019re going to give the CapEx update in February. But could you give us a little bit of a flavor of how it may or may not change in terms of your investment outlook, just simply given the differential that you\u2019re now seeing in Illinois distribution versus the other jurisdictions you have?","Warner Baxter","Sure, Paul, this is Warner. I\u2019ll touch a little bit on it and then, Marty, feel free to jump in. But no, look, at the end of the day, we\u2019ve said before, we like the formula rate framework. There are many things to like about it, including the ability to not only earn our allowed returns but also to give our retirement cash flows to make these investments. And so that\u2019s worked very well for us for a long time. And as you heard us say and me say on the call, it\u2019s a framework that we\u2019re going to continue to support whether it\u2019d be in the veto session or the next legislative session.","Look, we\u2019re mindful of the lower ROEs, too. And it\u2019s not lost upon us. And certainly, as we think about the overall framework, if there\u2019s an opportunity in the context of a legislative initiative for a good reasonable fix to the ROE, Richard and his team, they\u2019ll take a look at that. But we are clearly focused on this formula rates legislation passed through 2032 because we think that has delivered significant results to Illinois for so many reasons, not just investments, reliability, jobs and affordability.","Now, when we think about capital allocation, certainly, we\u2019ll be mindful of that, too. But right now, we\u2019ll come out with a more specific plan next year. That is potentially a lever. But as Marty also said, we have robust capital expenditures that we can put to work in all 4 of our business segments. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll talk more about that in February. Marty, anything more to add to that?","Marty Lyons","Warner, I think that was \u2013 it was a great response. And I think one of the things, Paul, to look at is, especially on Slide 8, I mean, over time, we have allocated more growth capital to the places where we\u2019ve had the more robust ROEs. And as Warner said, we do have robust pipelines of infrastructure investment opportunities in all of our jurisdictions. So without giving any specifics as to what we might unveil in February, certainly, we\u2019ve carefully allocated capital over time based upon ROEs and quality of regulatory frameworks.","The other thing I just mentioned, this gets a little bit back to Alex\u2019s question, as well as yours too, Paul. I mean in each one of our jurisdictions, we\u2019ll continue to work to earn as close to our allowed returns as we can. Alex was specifically asking about Missouri overcoming some of this decline in the performance incentives. And I would just note as I reflect on her question as it relates to Missouri in each one of our jurisdictions and earning the allowed, certainly, we\u2019re going to exercise disciplined financial management, both capital allocation as well as O&M controls, as well to work to earn as close to those allowed as we can as we deploy that growth capital.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And just in terms of the outlook on the legislation in Illinois, is there a potential, do you think, for changing the legislation significantly? Or is it pretty much more just sort of an effort of getting what\u2019s been working for you pretty well extended? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying?","Warner Baxter","Paul, this is Warner again. Look, we\u2019ve been real clear. Our objective is to take the existing formula rate framework and extend it to 2032. We\u2019ve been \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been advocating throughout this year. It\u2019s what we continue to advocate today, and that\u2019s what I said on the call. Whether we have an opportunity to address the ROE, that is something that we will look at. But look, we like what we have. And if we can make it even better, we will do that as well.","Paul Patterson","Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fallon with Citadel.","Kevin Fallon","Hey guys, how are you?","Warner Baxter","Good morning.","Marty Lyons","Good Kevin, thanks.","Kevin Fallon","I just wanted to ask just a little bit more specifically, on the FERC transmission subs, what kind of opportunity is there to add more capital? And also in terms of the kind of rolling five-year period on the PISA in Missouri, what\u2019s the headroom beyond what you currently have in the plan?","Warner Baxter","So a couple of things there, Kevin. I think when you look at \u2013 I\u2019ll start with transmission, and Michael, I\u2019ll let you jump in on the Missouri piece there. When we look together at transmission, as we\u2019ve said before, we think there are many robust transmission opportunities.","I think, number one, we\u2019ve said in other calls that when you see the level of renewable generation being added in the broader MISO footprint and you see all the interconnection agreements that are being put in place today, we believe when you step back and we get through these interconnection agreements that MISO will have an opportunity to step back and say, look, is this the most efficient and effective way for the transmission system to be configured? And we\u2019ll give those that are in MISO an opportunity to look at potentially multi-value projects down the road. Now, that\u2019s not tomorrow. But we do see that as certainly an opportunity down the road that could be in a robust expansion there.","Even today, we have a vast transmission system. And so today, we\u2019re continuing to address aging infrastructure. We continue to address sort of new compliance standards. That\u2019s not ending, both in Missouri and Illinois, and so we continue to see those investment opportunities to be real and significant.","And certainly, beyond that, there\u2019s certainly grid modernization with regard to security and all these other types of things. And so, Shawn, in the transmission business, we\u2019ve talked often about this, but we see the pipeline to continue to be robust. Anything that I missed in those areas that you and your team are looking at?","Shawn Schukar","No. I think you got to hear \u2013 well, Warner, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity that we see coming down the road, especially as we think about the transition to a carbon-free generation portfolio that will affect not only the upgrades on our system, but the flows on our system, which will cause us to think about additional investments.","Warner Baxter","Sure. Michael, why don\u2019t you hit on Missouri, please?","Michael Moehn","Really just similar, Warner, I don\u2019t think we specifically have commented about sort of where the complete opportunities are, other than to say, we have a robust pipeline there, right? I mean we\u2019re investing quite a bit of capital already year-over-year this year.","But as we look, I mean, we\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface in terms of making the investments to continue to improve the grid and make the \u2013 and meet the expectations that customers have for us from an increasing standpoint. So we feel that we have room underneath the cap to continue to do that over time.","Warner Baxter","Yes, if you look, as I said during the \u2013 my prepared remarks, Missouri is going in for a rate review, and it\u2019s asking for a $1 million rate decrease. And so I think that\u2019s evidence of the work that we\u2019re doing to be very disciplined in our cost management as well as putting to work really significant investments that have driven significant value to our customers and our communities.","Kevin Fallon","That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up, when you guys raised the growth rate before, obviously, it was driven by a lot of the stuff you were just highlighting in terms of the sizable capital program that you have going forward. And I know people are focused on the headwind from the 30-year. Should we still think that you guys have the program in place to do the midpoint of the range through the guidance period?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Kevin, this is Marty. Look, it goes back to the statement I made earlier. The guidance range we gave that 6% to 8%, it\u2019s about a $0.40 range. If you look at where our treasury rates were at the beginning of the year, about 3.1%. We gave guidance and now about 2.4%. It\u2019s about a $0.05 delta. So that is not going to move you outside the range and, frankly, not move you all that far off the midpoint.","And as I said earlier, we have a lot of tools in our toolkit as well as actions that we can take to offset a $0.05 decline. So look, I mean, we just talked about the robust pipeline we have in all of our jurisdictions. So we do believe we have a robust pipeline in transmission as well as Missouri, Illinois Gas, Illinois Electric delivery, really across the board, and it\u2019s a major tool that we have in our toolkit.","But as I said, over time, that range we have out there accommodates a lot of variables, and we expect to continue to allocate capital wisely. We expect to exercise disciplined management with respect to our costs with a real eye towards affordability for our customers. And we talked here today about making sure that we do the right things regulatorily, legislatively to make sure we deliver on our commitments.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. So it just doesn\u2019t sound, the nickel is basically the bogey for where \u2013 what you guys are \u2013 have to offset with the capital or whatnot?","Marty Lyons","Well, as I outlined, we\u2019re at 3.1% at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re at 2.4% today. That\u2019s about a nickel.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Mr. Kirk, there are no further questions at this time.

Marty will follow with more detailed comments on our financial results and outlook. We will then open the call for questions. Before Warner begins, I would like to mention that all per share earnings amounts discussed during today\u2019s presentation, including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now here is Warner, who will start on Page 4 of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015. Once again, we delivered another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2016 earnings results in a few minutes.","But first, I want to highlight some of the key actions we took to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Starting with our strategy to prudently invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks for the benefit of our customers. In fact, we invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure last year with two-thirds, over $1.3 billion, going to projects in the FERC regulated electric transmission and Illinois regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. A significant portion of the $1.3 billion was invested in the Illinois Rivers project, a new high-voltage transmission line, which will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2019 with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 river crossings and 8 of 10 substations now in service. This strategic allocation of capital and effective project execution, combined with disciplined cost management, meaningfully contributed to the solid financial results I just discussed.","Turning to Missouri, in order to earn a fair return on our electric business, we filed a rate review request in July with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We are seeking to recover costs related to infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and to remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. There was a recent development in this rate review and I will provide an important update in a few minutes.","Moving down the page last year, we also continued to work to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies. I am pleased to report that we have made very good progress on this strategic focus area as well. Notably, Ameren Illinois successfully advocated for the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act, which improved the already constructive regulatory framework for our electric distribution business in Illinois. This will extend its constructive formula ratemaking through 2022 enabling the continuation of our strong infrastructure investment plan to benefit our customers and the state of Illinois and also meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs. The law allows us to capitalize and earn a fair return on our future energy efficiency expenditures, which will enable Ameren Illinois to expand its energy efficiency programs for the benefit of our customers. Further, it provides revenue decoupling, eliminating potential sales margin erosion due to, among other things, energy efficiency.","Finally, this law will help maintain and create new jobs in our service territory and it contains strong consumer protections. Simply put, it was a win-win for all stakeholders in Illinois. And in Missouri, we continued our extensive efforts to enhance the state\u2019s regulatory framework for electric service in order to support the investment in a smarter energy grid and create jobs. A great deal of time and effort was spent working with key stakeholders after the 2016 legislative session to discuss this important matter for the state of Missouri. I will update you on our ongoing efforts in this area a bit later.","The final element of our strategy calls for creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. As I just mentioned, the Illinois energy legislation enacted in late 2016 enables expansion of energy efficiency programs and allows Ameren Illinois to capitalize and earn a fair return on those investments. Also, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved two solar pilot programs that will provide clean energy choices for our customers and increased investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri, should these pilots proved successful and the programs be expanded.","Finally, in September of last year, Ameren Missouri filed a plan with the Missouri PSC for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022 that would benefit customers should these investments be enabled by an enhanced electric regulatory framework. Ameren Missouri also identified additional potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period that would modernize its energy grid and facilitate the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio for the long-term benefit of its customers and the state of Missouri.","Turning now to Page 5 and earnings guidance. First, I am pleased to inform you that we expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects strong earnings per share growth of approximately 6.5% compared to weather normalized 2016 results. Marty will provide you more details on this a bit later. Second, we remained on track to deliver strong long-term earnings growth and continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 we provided a year ago. We plan to deliver these earnings results in the future through the continued execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond.","Turning now to Page 6, a key element of our strategy is to continue to advance our plan for investing in our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth outlook I just discussed is driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan and I am pleased to say that we expect to grow our rate base at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment.","Our transmission projects are projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by 13% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2021 period. In addition, our investments in Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas are expected to result in 9% compound annual rate base growth for each of these businesses for the same period. I would note that energy efficiency investments made under the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act are incorporated into this outlook. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Of course, the expected Missouri rate base growth rate would increase from this level if legislation is enacted that sufficiently enhances the state\u2019s regulatory framework to support investment.","Moving now to Page 7, another key element of our strategy is to achieve a fair and balanced resolution to our pending Missouri electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, the Ameren Missouri, the staff at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect the stipulation and agreement signed by these parties and possibly others to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission very soon, with the request of the agreement be approved by the commission. At this point, the agreement in principle is considered confidential. However, I would note that the earnings guidance we have provided today is consistent with these terms.","Turning to Page 8 of the presentation, enhancing Missouri\u2019s electric regulatory framework remains a key strategic focus, because we strongly believe it would bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and the entire State of Missouri. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers\u2019 rising energy needs and expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. With these benefits in mind, in December 2016, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act was filed.","This slide slight outlines the key provisions of the bill. In summary, Senate Bill 190 would implement important regulatory reforms which would drive significant infrastructure investments and results in the benefits I just described. In addition, this legislation contains robust consumer protections including strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. And finally, Senate Bill 190 includes forward-thinking economic development provisions for our larger energy consumers, which in turn would help create good quality jobs. I would note that enactment of this legislation in its current form will support Ameren Missouri\u2019s ability to execute on $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investment over 5 years.","Consistent with this filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission last fall, we along with all of the other Missouri investor owned electric utilities, have continued to actively engage in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for this important legislation. I am pleased to report that Senate Bill 190 was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last week by a bipartisan 8 to 1 vote, is now headed to the full Senate consideration. While good progress is made on Senate Bill 190 to-date, we are still very early in the legislative process. Keep in mind that the legislative session ends on May 12. As we move to the session, we will continue our extensive outreach and collaboration with key stakeholders to move Missouri forward on this important energy and economic policy initiative for the long-term benefit of our customers and the entire state of Missouri.","Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation and a discussion of potential federal corporate income tax reform, I will begin by saying that Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform as we believe that lower corporate tax rates drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. Recognizing that we are still in the relatively early stages of a tax reform debate, we are focusing our advocacy efforts with some key principles in mind. We want to ensure that tax reform does not negatively impact our key stakeholders, notably our customers as well as appropriately supports our industry\u2019s efforts to invest in our nation\u2019s critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. With these principles in mind, this slide highlights key areas of focus for Ameren and our industry.","As I noted, it is still early in this debate and there are many moving parts, but we also recognize that many of you are interested in what impact tax reform could have on Ameren. Based on our current assessment of preliminary tax reform proposals, aside from the expected one-time non-cash charge to write-down certain of our deferred tax assets, we do not believe this plan would impact our strong earnings growth guidance through 2020. Marty will address some of the underlying assumptions associated with our assessment in a few moments. Of course, I expect there will be several changes to the tax reform proposals between now and the end of the debate. That is why Ameren and many of my colleagues in the industry will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders on this important economic policy matter in the months ahead.","Turning now to Page 10, here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the energy grid will be increasingly more important and valuable to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. We plan to continue to invest to modernize our electric and gas transmission and distribution operations to make them safer, smarter and more resilient. As well as invest in smart meters and new technologies in order to meet our customers\u2019 future energy needs and expectations. Right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow these energy delivery businesses to nearly three quarters of our rate base by the end of 2021. As a result, our investment in coal and gas fired generation is expected to decline to a combined 15% of rate base by year end 2021.","We are also advancing our efforts on innovative technologies to increase operating efficiencies, strengthen the energy grid and create innovative energy solutions for our customers. Further, we remain focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. And this transition will continue beyond 2021 with the schedule retirement of Meramec\u2019s coal fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders.","Moving to Page 11, we anticipate that the execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond will not only bring superior value to our customers, but also to our shareholders. To reiterate, we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we provided a year ago. Further, as I also discussed, we project rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 to 2021. We expect these growth rates to compare favorably with our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares offer investors an attractive dividend. The annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share incorporates the October 2016 decision by the Board of Directors to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year, reflecting their continued confidence in the outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. And we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions.","To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner and good morning everyone. I am turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for 2016. On Page 14, we highlight factors that drove the $0.12 per share year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 core results.","As discussed in today\u2019s press release, we now consider Ameren to have four reportable segments. You can see the 2015 and 2016 comparative earnings per share contributions of these segments graphically at the right where we show Ameren Missouri in green representing all of the operations of Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in dark blue, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas in light blue and last, but certainly not least, Ameren Transmission in orange, which is composed of the FERC-regulated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. We believe that analyzing and reporting results in this manner is appropriate given the unique regulatory framework associated with each segment and the manner in which we allocate capital and which to assess performance over time. We hope you find this new segment presentation useful.","So then diving into the comparative earnings results, let\u2019s start with Ameren Transmission, where the earnings per share contribution increased from $0.34 in 2015 to $0.48 in 2016. This 41% growth was driven by increased infrastructure investments at both ATXI and Ameren Illinois which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, coupled with higher average earned returns on equity. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC\u2019s order in the first complaint case then lowered the allowed ROE in late September 2016 to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder for voluntary participation in MISO.","Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, in 2016, we saw the earnings contribution of this segment increase 60%, rising from $0.15 per share to $0.24 per share. This growth was again driven by infrastructure investment as well as an updated allowed return on equity, both of which were reflected in rates that became effective in December of 2015, incorporating a 2016 forward test year.","Turning to our Illinois Electric Distribution business, 2016 results grew by just 2% from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.52 in 2016. Here the benefits of infrastructure investment in warmer summer weather were partially offset by the temporary impacts of a lower allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.64% for the year prior. The 2016 allowed ROE was based on the 2016 average 30-year treasury yield of 2.6%, down from the 2015 average of 2.84%. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by the absence in 2016 of certain power usage cost recoveries reflected in 2015 results. The earnings contribution from Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, declined from $1.63 in 2015 to $1.47 in 2016.","Here, the earnings benefits very warm summer temperatures and disciplined cost management were not enough to overcome the unfavorable impacts of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and the unfavorable year-over-year comparative earnings impact of the 2013 to 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan. In 2016, Ameren Missouri recognized a performance incentive award associated with the energy efficiency results achieved over the 3 years ending in 2015, reflecting the tremendous success of this program for our customers. However, this was lower than our energy efficiency program benefits recognized in 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center in 2016 compared to no such outage in the prior year as well as higher depreciation expense. Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was positively impacted by the first quarter recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.","Before moving on, let me briefly cover 2016 electric sales growth compared to the prior year. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers were up slightly in both Illinois and Missouri, reflecting underlying growth and the leap day sales benefit partially offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2016 decreased about 1% primarily due to lower sales to several large low margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we did see year-over-year growth in sales to industrial customers in the second half of the year after a first half decline. Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers declined about one half of 1%, excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter.","Moving to Page 15 of our presentation, I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2017 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2016 results. Ameren Missouri\u2019s earnings are expected to rise in 2017 assuming increased electric service rates consistent with the agreement in principle to settle its pending rate review. The new rates would address the negative earnings impacts of reduced sales levels to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison. The new rates are also expected to reflect infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers through December 31, 2016 and changes in various operating expense levels.","In 2017, we expect Missouri\u2019s results to reflect increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. These increases in expense are expected to continue to be a drag on earned returns particularly during the first half of 2017 prior to the date when rates are adjusted. In addition, a return to normal temperatures would reduce Ameren Missouri\u2019s earnings by $0.08 per share compared to last year. Further, Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the previously mentioned energy efficiency performance incentive award that was recognized in 2016. Finally, expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of this year, are expected to be comparable to those experienced as a result of the spring outage last year.","Moving now to our transmission business earnings are expected to rise in 2017 benefiting from additional infrastructure investments made in Ameren Illinois and ATXI under formula ratemaking. However, we expect this benefit to be partially offset by a lower projected weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to last year. As I discussed a few minutes ago, our FERC-allowed ROE was temporarily increased for part of 2016, resulting in average allowed ROE of approximately 11.3% for the full year. Since late September of last year, our FERC-allowed ROE has been 10.82%. Our guidance reflects a FERC final order in the second MISO ROE complaint case in the second quarter of this year with an ROE consistent with the ALJ\u2019s recommendation. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum is created at the FERC.","Moving now to Page 16 and our Illinois Electric Distribution business, we anticipate increased weather-normalized earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, Illinois Electric Distribution earnings incorporate a formula-based allowed ROE of 9.1% using a forecasted 3.3% 2017 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2016. These positive factors are expected to be mitigated by the absence in 2017 of the benefit of warmer than normal 2016 summer temperatures as revenue decoupling becomes effective this year.","I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE for Illinois Electric Distribution on this page. Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, natural gas segment earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state\u2019s gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2017 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year as underlying growth is expected to be offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs and the absence of the leap day. Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt hour sales to this group are expected to be up 1% to 2% compared to last year.","Moving finally to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 38% this year, an increase from last year\u2019s rate of 36.7%, reflecting substantially lower expected first quarter 2017 tax benefits associated with share based compensation as compared to 2016. Of course this effective tax rate as well as other elements of our 2017 guidance, assumes no change in federal income tax policy during the year. I will add to the color Warner provided on potential tax legislation in a moment.","Turning to Page 17, for 2017 we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $700 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2017 capital expenditures by a business with nearly two-thirds allocated to jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year\u2019s negative free cash flow and debt maturities with short-term and long-term borrowings.","Moving to Page 18 of the presentation, here we provide an overview of our $10.8 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2017 through 2021 period. The expected funding sources including substantial income tax deferrals and tax assets for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures including bonus tax depreciation provided in current law. The tax assets include $440 million with the parent company that are not currently earning a return. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity over this period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity.","Moving now to Page 19, earlier, Warner discussed our support for thoughtful Federal tax reform and some of the key areas of focus for Ameren and the utility industry as a whole. He also mentioned that we believe the debate on tax reform elements is in the early stages and we are far from knowing final tax reform attributes and consequently, the true financial consequences. That said, we know that many of you are attempting to model the potential impacts of known reform considerations. Here, we attempted to provide some key Ameren considerations relative to the pillars of widely discussed tax reform proposals. Overall, I would say we are well positioned to sustain our earnings per share growth rate expectations through 2020.","Today, our operations are fully rate regulated and we have relatively little parent company debt after considering that which supports our transmission segment. Further, we have strong balance sheet, credit metrics relative to our current credit ratings and we have a solid infrastructure investment pipeline filled with projects that would benefit customers. We do expect that lowering the Federal corporate tax rate would cause us to revalue our Ameren parent tax asset balances as well as certain deferred tax balances of our rate regulated subsidiaries, causing a one-time non-cash charge to earnings to be recognized upon such a tax rate reduction becoming law.","However, a lower corporate tax rate favorably impacts customer rates and our tax obligations prospectively. And while near-term negative cash flow impacts may occur relative to forecasted levels between the time when tax rates are reflected in rates and corporate tax obligations are reduced as well as due to the expected gradual flow back of excess deferred taxes, we expect that cash flow reductions would be mitigated by increased earnings on additional rate base, emanating from comparatively higher NOL balances and lower deferred tax obligations reflected in rate base. Overall, we currently forecast those net cash flow reductions to be manageable in the context of our overall capitalization and long-term cash flow forecast. And to reiterate, we expect no change to our earnings per share growth outlook based on our modeling of current tax reform proposals. But then again the debate is far from over and uncertainty clearly exists.","Finally, turning to Page 20, I will summarize. In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth and continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to peers.","That compare \u2013 that concludes the prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up and re-queue for any additional questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Russo","Hi, good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning Brian.","Brian Russo","The $1 billion of incremental investment opportunities in Missouri, would that require external equity needs?","Warner Baxter","Brian, I think as we think about that extra $1 billion, obviously we are pursuing changes in the Missouri framework that would allow us to actually move forward with those to the extent that we have the opportunity to make those investments for the benefit of customers. What we will do Brian, at that point is step back and look at our overall capital plan, assess and reassess what we have got in that plan and also step back and reassess our financing. So I think it\u2019s premature that we would need to issue any additional equity or that we would issue additional equity. We will take a step back and look at our overall capital expenditure and financing plans. Of course, we do have a very strong balance sheet today. And we have very strong credit metrics relative to our ratings. So we will assess all of those things as we move forward to the extent we have that opportunity.","Brian Russo","Okay. And at the Missouri legislature, it\u2019s my understanding that there are three bills being proposed yet your comments and the presentation slides focus on Senate Bill 190, I am just curious to know why, is that \u2013 does 190 have a higher likelihood of success versus the other two?","Warner Baxter","Hi Brian, this is Warner. Couple of comments, yes, in December, three bills were filed. Senate Bill 190, which we spent most of our time on, but then there are two other bills Senate Bill 214 and Senate Bill 215. Senate Bill 214 really is very similar to the performance based rate-making bill that was filed last year and then Senate Bill 215 is similar to what I would say enabling language. Our focus right now and those in the industry is on Senate Bill 190. We believe when you take all the stakeholder input that we have had since last session and even in this session, it reflects many of the inputs that we have received from stakeholders and so that\u2019s our focal point now. Those other two bills are still out there, but we are focused on Senate Bill 190.","Brian Russo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Lau with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Lau","Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit about the commission in Missouri, they did a review of the remaking framework last December I believe, are they still involved in the process or has it \u2013 has your focal point kind of shifted to the legislator at this point?","Warner Baxter","And so look, I am going to turn it over to Michael Moehn who overseas our Missouri operations. Michael, you can comment a little bit about the process the commission has gone through in the past and then sort of where we are at.","Michael Moehn","Sure, absolutely. Yes. I mean look, the workshop that occurred over the summer was a productive process. Obviously, we participated a great deal on that. We are appreciative of all the hard work that was put into it. I think there were some constructive recommendations that came out of that from the Missouri Public Service Commission. And look yes, we obviously stay close to them and are engaged with them about this legislative process and continue to get feedback from them.","Larry Lau","Thanks. And I just want to quickly jump to financing needs, I know you talked about your cash flow plan for 2017, but with tax reform, is there strong consideration for financing at the transmission level or at the holding company level, I think historically, you have always used holding company leverage for your transmission investments?","Marty Lyons","Yes, sure. Well, it\u2019s something that\u2019s actively under consideration. Appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, they have about $675 million of maturities this year in June. At Ameren Missouri, we have got a $425 million maturity. And then in November, we have got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois. And so as we look ahead this year few things, we expect that midyear following that maturity at Missouri, we would likely do a financing there. In late in the year in November, December after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we would also plan to do a financing there. There, I think not only to refinance the maturity, but also some of the capital expenditures that we have had through the year in Ameren Illinois. And then of course as you mentioned, we have been financing the transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, financing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow and so it\u2019s likely around midyear that we would execute some sort of a long-term financing and we will provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year, but you identified say the relevant considerations whether to do that long-term financing at the parent or at the transmission entity down at ATXI. So, those are things that we are assessing. We do, like I say, expect that we will do execute on long-term financing around midyear, but those details are still being thought through and we will share more with you later in the year.","Larry Lau","Alright, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you. Just around the fourth quarter results, were there any drivers that you could provide around that weather impacted weather or otherwise? And then just to confirm around the Missouri stipulation, was that unanimous or not?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Gregg. This is Marty. Let me start with the Q4 results. So, with regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive, in fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year, but versus our expectations which revolved around normal weather, weather was a negative about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year, including a warm fourth quarter. So, it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter. Of course, we benefited from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously that was a benefit in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. Though I will tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected, so tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus in our expectations coming into the fourth quarter. And then again going back compared to prior years, we had lower benefits from the energy efficiency programs in Missouri. You will recall that in 2015 as we were coming to the end of that first energy efficiency program, we had high take rates, if you will, on the incentives we are providing to customers and that translated into some benefits being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn\u2019t recur then in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then of course, don\u2019t forget about the year-over-year impact of the New Madrid smelter load loss which was obviously a negative in 2016 versus \u201815. So again compared to prior year plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the effective tax rate, minus on the energy efficiency impacts and a minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that\u2019s kind of how it all shakes up compared to the prior year, but again compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So, how we shake all that up? And then I think your second question, we will turn it over to \u2013 back to Michael Moehn.","Michael Moehn","Yes, with respect to the agreement in principle, it is with all the major parties I would say at this point, the staff, the Office of Public Counsel, several industrial groups, division of energy. So, clearly the major parties in the case. Once we file the stipulation and agreement with the commission, I hope it to be unanimous at the end of that, but it\u2019s just a bit premature to say that.","Gregg Orrill","Okay, thank you.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Gregg.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Doug Fischer for closing remarks.","Doug Fischer","Thank you for participating in this call. Let me remind you again that a replay of the call will be available for one year on our website. If you have questions, you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Financial analyst inquiries should be directed to me, Doug Fischer or my associate, Andrew Kirk. Media should call Joe Mellencamp. Our contact numbers are on the release.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Douglas Fischer, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may now begin.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, and good morning. I'm Doug Fisher, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. On the call with me today are Tom Voss, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Warner Baxter, our President; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.","Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet and the webcast will be available for one year on our website at ameren.com. Further, this call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast. And redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.","To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on our website that will be referenced by our speakers. To access this presentation, please look in the Investors section of our website under Webcasts and Presentations and follow the appropriate link.","Turning to page two of the presentation, I need to inform you that comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.","For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-Looking Statements section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC.","Tom will begin this call with a review of 2013 earnings and accomplishments. Warner will follow with a discussion of our plans for executing on our strategy and our earnings growth outlook. Marty will conclude with discussions of 2013 financial results, 2014 guidance, 2015 earnings drivers and other financial matters. We will then open the line for questions.","Before Tom begins, I would like to mention that all per share amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here's Tom, who will begin on page four of the presentation.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced earnings for 2013 of $2.10 per share, compared to $2.13 per share for 2012. On a weather-normalized basis 2013 results improved over the prior year's results reflecting increased rates for Missouri electric and Illinois transmission service and increased Illinois electric delivery service earnings under formula ratemaking.","The increase in weather-normalized earnings was achieved despite several negative impacts on year-over-year earnings comparison. These negative impacts included 2013 nuclear refueling outage expenses compared to no refueling outage in 2012; two 2013 charges related to regulatory decisions and the absence in 2013 of a benefit from 2012 regulatory decision. Marty will provide further details on earnings in a few minutes.","Moving to page five. Last year was a pivotal one in the history of Ameren, and I would like to highlight some of our key 2013 accomplishments. First and foremost, we exited our merchant generation business to focus exclusively on strengthening and growing our rate regulated utilities.","As we will highlight in a moment, we are very excited about our prospects with these businesses with divestiture of our Ameren Energy Resources business to an affiliate of Dynegy was completed in early December. Further, we closed the sale of our remaining operating merchant facilities, three gas-fired energy centers to an affiliate of Rockland Capital last month.","The second major accomplishment was State of Illinois' enactment of legislation for which we advocated that supports our plans to invest in energy delivery infrastructure for the benefit of our customers and create jobs. This included one law that constructively clarified certain elements of electric delivery formula ratemaking, and the second law that established the framework for timely gas delivery rate adjustments for qualified infrastructure investments.","Third, Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois attained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Illinois Congress Commission from portions of it's approximately $1.1 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project in 2013. And just yesterday the ICC issued a constructive order on rehearing, granting a certificate for all remaining portions of the project. Illinois Rivers is our largest current investment project and is a cornerstone of our plan to grow FERC-regulated investments.","Fourth, Ameren Illinois received a December order from ICC authorizing increased gas delivery service rates that reflect planned investments that will enhance safety and service to customers.","Fifth accomplishment of note was Ameren Missouri's successful implementation of the state's most expensive energy efficiency plan. This plan includes the range of programs and provides timely recovery of associated cost as well as the opportunity for us to earn the performance incentive to be collected after completion of the three year plan.","Finally, 2013 was another year of strong operating performance at our utilities as well as disciplined cost management. Combining Missouri and Illinois electric distribution reliability as measured by the number of interruptions per customer served state a company record for the third year in a row, and Missouri baseload energy center performance remained solid with equivalent availability of 83%. I believe each of these accomplishments positions us well to execute our strategy; a strategy that we believe will deliver superior long term value for our customers and shareholders in the future.","Speaking of the future, earlier this week we announced that I will retire from Ameren on July 1 of this year. In connection with my upcoming retirement, our Board named Warner Baxter President of Ameren and also elected him to the Board. On April 24, Warner will become CEO and on July 1 he is expected to be named Chairman.","Warner joined Ameren in 1995 and he was promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO in 2003. Since 2009 Warner has served as President and CEO of our largest subsidiary Ameren Missouri and remains so until successor's name. I know that many of you already know Warner and share my belief that he is focused on providing value for both our shareholders and customers.","Moving to page seven of our presentation, I will now turn the call over to Warner.","Warner Baxter","Thanks Tom, and let me begin by saying that I'm just very humble and honoured to follow you as the leader of Ameren. I have a few more comments to add at the end of our call, but I want to begin this discussion by saying that I'm very excited about the company's future.","I'm excited because over the last several years our entire Ameren team has positioned itself to execute a solid growth strategy that I believe will deliver superior long term value to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.","This is the same strategy that we have outlined to you previously. We are committed to successfully executing that strategy in years ahead. In particularly, we remained committed to investing and operating our regulated businesses in a manner consistent with our existing and regulatory frameworks.","As a result, 2014 will be another year of optimizing our operating and capital spending within these regulatory frameworks including managing costs in a disciplined manner. It will also be another year of allocating increasing amounts of discretionary capital into businesses operating under constructive regulatory frameworks.","Ameren Illinois will continue to invest in electric and gas delivery service enhancements and our Illinois monetization action plan. In addition, Ameren Illinois is focused on continued investment in local transmission, reliability projects that benefit from FERC's formulaic ratemaking and allow return on investment. These investments are made possible by the constructive regulatory frameworks in place for these businesses.","We're also committed to pursuing rate increases when needed. That's why this year in Missouri plans to file an electric rate increase request to recover operating costs including higher net fuel costs and investments in energy infrastructure made for the benefit of our customers.","These investments include two significant capital projects, replacement of the reactor head at our Callaway Nuclear Energy Center and upgrades to the electrostatic precipitators in our coal-fired Labadie energy center. Both projects were scheduled to be completed in fourth quarter of this year.","The timing of the rate request is designed to minimize as much as possible under the existing Missouri regulatory framework, the regulatory life on these important projects. Our need to file this rate increase request squarely contradicts the February 12 filing by Noranda Aluminum with the Missouri of Pubic Service Commission alleging that the Ameren Missouri is over-earning and then its rates should be reduced.","Interestingly, on the same day, Noranda also filed with the commission a request that it's electric rates to be reduced outside of a traditional rate case, asking that a significant portion of our cost to serve them is shifted to our other customers for 10 years. We will vigorously appose these Noranda filings and look forward to defending our position before the Missouri Public Service Commission.","Moving onto another element of our strategy. This year we will continue our work to enhance regulatory frameworks. In Missouri, we have been engaged with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for legislation that will reduce regulatory lag allowing us to increase discretionary investments in our aging Missouri energy infrastructure to enhance customer service and reliability and create jobs.","Yesterday Senate Bill 909 was filed. The primary objective of this bill is to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework to support investment in aging energy infrastructure to all the investor-owned utilities in the state. You should note this bill is different from the bill that was filed last year. After numerous discussions with key stakeholders after last year's session, it was determined that a more incremental approach to modernising Missouri's regulatory framework was appropriate.","As a result, this bill is targeted to address the regulatory lag associated with depreciation and the cost of capital for qualifying energy infrastructure investments, placement service between rate cases. This bill will not allow interim adjustments in customers' rates between rate cases, but it will allow utilities to differ and to cover the depreciation and cost of capital associated with infrastructure investments actually serving customers in the next rate case.","Robust consumer protections are included in the bill, including the 1% rate cap for every year between rate cases. The lead sponsor of this bill is Senator Parson and the bill's co-sponsor is Senator Kehoe. We appreciate Senator Parson's and Senator Kehoe's leadership on this important energy policy initiative for state of Missouri.","A third element of our strategy is to develop and execute on rate regulated opportunities for investments that benefit our customers, create jobs and grow rate base and earnings. Our ability to successfully execute this element of our strategy is best executed by the multi-value Illinois Rivers transmission project.","As Tom mentioned, just yesterday the ICC issued a constructive order on the hearing for this project, granting the certificate of public convenience and necessity for all portions of the project. It was a certificate that not been previously granted. Substation construction is already underway and line construction is expected to begin later this year.","Looking ahead, our planning efforts extend well beyond the next several years. We are actively focused on selecting and developing other investment projects in all our regulated businesses to provide customers with safe, reliable and environmentally responsible service not just for the near term, but over the coming decade.","Turning now to page eight of our presentation. Clearly outlined how we were investing in a manner consistent with our strategy. On the top of this page we list our rate regulated business by jurisdiction and summarized our allowed rates return on equity, speed of cost recovery and forecasted annual rate base growth. On the bottom half of the slide we show our plans to grow rate base by a projected 6% compound annual rate from year end of 2013 to 2014.","Importantly, you should note that we are allocating significant and growing amounts of discretionary capital to our FERC-regulated electric transmission businesses and Illinois deliverable utilities as these operate under formulaic and constructive regulatory frameworks. We have a solid list of transmission projects which are projected to increase our FERC-regulated transmission rate base by approximately 28% compounded annually over this period.","In addition, our Illinois Modernization Action Plan investments are expected to contribute to projected Illinois electric and gas delivery compound annual rate base growth of 5% and 7% respectively. Our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Over the last several years the regulatory framework in Missouri has improved, especially in terms of addressing regulatory lag associated with significant and volatile operating costs.","However, rate of progress must be made to improve the framework to support investment in our aging energy infrastructure. Further regulatory enhancement in Missouri would allow us to develop a pipeline of future Missouri investment opportunities that enhanced customer service and reliability and increased rate base growth.","This is the primary driver behind the legislation that was filed yesterday and discussed a moment ago. As the rate-regulated utility business we expect our planned rate base growth will drive earnings growth. In addition, we expect an increase in the FERC-regulated piece of the rate base pie from 7% at year end 2013 to 18% by year end 2018 will improve our jurisdictional diversity in our blended earn return on rate base.","Finally, parent and other expenses are expected to decline in 2014 and in 2015 for reasons Marty will discuss, further enhancing earnings in these years.","Moving now to page nine, we project a continued execution of our strategy will drive strong earnings growth in 2014 as well as over the next five years. We expect 2014 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 per share to $2.45 per share. A significant advance from the $2.10 per share earned last year. Marty will discuss the specific drivers of this 2014 earnings growth in a few minutes.","Further, we expect earnings per share to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 to 2018, rate better than the expected average of our regulated peers. This five-year outlook accommodates a range of treasury rate, sales growth, spending level and regulatory developments.","I would note that assuming treasury rates are flat with current levels over the period and all other assumptions are unchanged, our five-year earnings growth rate will fall slightly below the midpoint of our expected range.","Finally, we inspired to grow the dividend as earnings grow and expect our dividend payout to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings.","Like Tom, I am pleased with the progress we have made to-date in implementing our strategy. And I firmly believe the company is well positioned to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders as we continue to execute that strategy.","Now before I turn the call over to Marty, I want to express my appreciation for the patience from our customers who experienced power outages last evening, and those still without power this morning. Very storm with high winds roared to our service territory last evening and brought down trees and power lines.","Our crews worked throughout the night and this morning we had approximately 7,000 customers without power. We will have nearly all customers back on by the end of the day. And a special thanks to all of our dedicated co-workers who worked safely and diligently to restore power to our customers.","I'll now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to page 11 of our presentation. Today we did report earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $0.19 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012.","There were several key drivers on the $0.14 per share earnings improvement. First, increased rates for Missouri electric and Illinois transmission service both effective in January of 2013 at a combined positive effect of $0.05 per share.","Second, higher Illinois electric delivery earnings recognized under formula ratemaking improved earnings by $0.04 per share compared to the year ago quarter. This improvement reflect the timing differences among each year's quarters, increased rate base and the higher allowed return on equity as a result of higher 30-year treasury bond yields.","Third, winter weather was colder in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 when weather was closer to normal. This colder weather increased earnings by an estimated $0.04 per share compared to the prior year period.","Fourth, an increase in weather-normalized electric and gas sales volumes boosted the earnings comparison by $0.03 per share. These positive factors will partially offset by a fourth quarter 2013 charge of $0.04 per share related to the ICC's disallowance of certain debt redemption cost in December electric and gas delivery rate orders.","Moving to page 12, in the discussion of full-year 2013 results. As Tom previously mentioned, earnings for 2013 were $2.10 per share compared to $2.13 per share for 2012. However, on a weather-normalized basis result increased to approximately $2.08 per share in 2013 from approximately $2.04 per share in 2012. This non-GAAP comparison reflected the fact that earnings for both years were boosted by abnormal weather in the amounts noted on this page.","Factors favourably affecting the comparison of 2013 earnings to prior year results included previously mentioned Missouri electric and Illinois transmission rate increases which lifted earnings by a combined $0.29 per share. These January 2013 rate increases provided recovery of and returns on infrastructure investments made to serve customers.","In addition, higher Illinois electric delivery earnings recognized under formula ratemaking boosted results by $0.06 per share, reflecting infrastructure investment, a higher allowed return on equity due to higher 30-year treasury yields and the absence in 2013 of 2012 contribution required to implement formula ratemaking.","The increase in weather-normalized earnings for 2013 as compared to 2012 was achieved despite several notable drags on the comparison. These drags included 2013 nuclear refueling outage expenses for the Callaway Energy Center of $0.10 per share, compared to 2012 when there was no refueling outage, and two 2013 charges in the absence of the 2012 benefit are related to regulatory decisions which had a combined negative effect of $0.18 per share.","Turning now to page 13, as Warner mentioned, we expect 2014 earnings to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. Factors expected to positively impact 2014 earnings compared to 2013 include the absence of the previously discussed 2013 charges related to regulatory decisions.","In addition, Illinois electric delivery earnings are expected to increase under formula ratemaking, driven by planned investments to provide enhanced service to customers and result in rate base growth, as well as the higher allowed return due to expected higher treasury yield. We estimate Ameren Illinois 2014 year-end electric delivery rate base to be approximately $2.2 billion.","Further, the 2014 formula midpoint allowed return on equity is estimated to be 9.9%, which incorporates a forecasted 2014 average 30-year treasury yield of 4.1% compared with the 2013 average yield of 3.45%. The 2014 treasury yield forecast was based on the Blue Chip consensus estimate as of February 1, 2014.","The year-over-year earnings comparison will benefit from an increase in Illinois gas delivery rates that became effective at the beginning of this year. We also expect higher transmission earnings form Ameren Illinois and ATXI under forward-looking formula FERC ratemaking reflecting our growing investments in these businesses. The combined Ameren Illinois and ATXI average transmission rate base has projected to grow to approximately $900 million, up from approximately $600 million in 2013.","Another driver of expected 2014 earnings growth compared to 2013 is a decline in parent company and other cost. We project that these costs will decline to approximately $0.10 per share in 2014 due to refinancing of an 8.875% parent company debt issue that matures in May and a reduction of operating cost.","Turning now to page 14. These expected positive factors are projected to be partially offset by a return in normal weather, reducing earnings by an estimate of $0.02 per share. In addition, we expect weather-normalized electric sales volumes to decline in both Missouri and Illinois compared to 2013, reflecting the effects of our energy efficiency plans in both states and the ongoing phase out for incandescent light bulbs and the replacement with more energy efficient lighting alternatives.","It's important to note that the earnings impact of reduced Missouri electric sales volumes due to our energy efficiency programs will be mitigated by revenue recovery based on programs under our Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act plan. Further, the earnings impact of lower electric sales volumes in Illinois is limited by the 50 basis point colour around the allowed ROE.","Other factors expected to negatively effect 2014 earnings compared to 2013 include increases in other operations and maintenance, depreciation and property tax expenses for Missouri and Illinois gas delivery service. Our 2014 earnings guidance incorporates an effective consolidated income tax rate of approximately 38.5%. Finally, the earnings guidance incorporates average basic common shares of $242.6 million, unchanged from the prior year level.","Turning to page 15 of our presentation, I would like to discuss 2015 earnings drivers. Factors expected to positively impact next year's earnings include new Missouri electric rates effective in mid-2015. In addition, Illinois electric delivery earnings are expected to increase under formula ratemaking as a result of rate base growth and a higher allowed ROE due to a forecasted increase in 30-year treasury bond yields.","Ameren Illinois and ATXI transmission earnings are also expected to increase, reflecting FERC formula ratemaking and rate base growth. Further, the earnings comparison should be positively affected by the absence of the Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling outage and related expenses since no refueling outage is scheduled for 2015.","Finally, we expect a further decline in parent and other cost, reflecting a full year's benefit from the 2014 refinancing of parent company debt. These expected positive factors are projected to be partially offset by increased Missouri operations and maintenance expenses, excluding the benefit of no refueling outage as well as increased Missouri depreciation property tax and interest cost.","Before we conclude our discussion of our earnings outlook, I'll remind you that our 2014 guidance as well as the 2013 through 2018 earnings growth expectations Warner discussed, are subject to the risks and uncertainty outlined or referred to in the forward-looking statement section of today's press release and our SEC filings.","Moving now to page 16. Here we provide our 2014 cash flow guidance. As shown on this page, we calculate free cash flow by starting with our cash flows from operating activities, subtracting from our capital expenditures, adding other cash flows from investing activities and subtracting dividends.","For 2014 we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $800 million. On the right side of the page we provide a breakdown of our $1.825 billion of planned 2014 capital expenditures including substantial investments in businesses which operate under constructive regulatory frameworks.","FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and gas delivery service. I call your attention to the two footnotes on this page. First, the other cash flows from investing activities includes approximately $150 million of cash proceeds in the previously mentioned January 2014 sales of three merchant gas-fired energy centers. These cash proceeds are equal to Ameren's 2013 put option related payments to a former affiliate that was included in the divestiture of the Ameren Energy Resources business to Dynegy as well as sell related cost.","Second, the dollar amount of dividend shown on this page incorporates the current common dividend rate. Of course, the amount and timing of common dividends are considered by Ameren's Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.","In terms of financing we plan to fund the 2014 negative free cash flow with a mix of long-term and short-term borrowings.","Turning to page 17, I would like to provide an overview of our $8.3 billion of planned regulated capital expenditures for the 2014 through 2018 period. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of changes in differed tax and tax assets over this five-year period.","The expected changes in differed taxes are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures. The tax assets include at year end 2013 approximately $600 million consisting of federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards, federal and state income tax credit carry-forwards and expected income tax refunds and state tax over payments.","Approximately $450 million of this total is driven by historical merchant generation related tax losses. These tax assets are expected to be realized into 2016. As I mentioned earlier, we do not expect to issue any additional common shares in 2014. Should we decide to issue additional equity at some point over this five-year period, we would expect to do so by issuing new shares for dividend re-investments in 401-K plans.","We\u2019re committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity.","Turning to Page [18], I will summarize, well 2013 earnings per share declined on a reported basis, they improved on a weather-normalized basis despite several negative impacts on the year-over-year comparison.","We\u2019ve completed our exit from the merchant generation business and are focused exclusively on strengthening and growing our rate-regulated utilities. We have a well-defined strategic plan that is aligned with our regulatory frameworks and designed to enhance customer service and reliability.","Our investment plan coupled with disciplined cost control is expected to lead the solid earnings per share growth in 2014 and we expect earnings per share to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 to 2018, a rate better than we expected average of our regulated peers.","Further aiming $1.60 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with the yield of approximately 4.1%.","Finally, we aspire to grow our dividend as earnings grow and expect our dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of annual earnings.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions)","Our first question is coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hi, good morning.","Martin J. Lyons","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","So, first quick question kind of a high level one. Can you perhaps more precisely address the disproportion at EPS growth versus the prior rate base CAGR you\u2019ve been talking about? Can you kind of delineate the drivers of that?","Martin J. Lyons","What are trying to reconcile the rate base growth to what?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","To your EPS CAGR.","Martin J. Lyons","Sure.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","How would you guess the 10% if you will?","Martin J. Lyons","Yeah, sure Julien. I think we provided these building blocks in the past and I\u2019ll go through them again. I mean the rate base growth is the foundation. But then when you look at some of these one-items that I prefer or the regulatory impacts this past year, these are the charges that I outlined. The fuel adjustment cost charge that we had, the ICC redemption cost disallowance.","You back out some of those, you build up your 2014 earnings then you can talk about and you look that reduction and compare other cost where we had about if you look at the income statement or look in the staff pages on the other.","We had about $0.18 of drag this past year from those other costs which as I said on the call, we expect to get down to about $0.10 in 2014 and then you can realize some further savings into 2015.","Then you think about where our rate base growth is going as we transition our rate base to a heavier emphasis on FERC-regulated transmission. You again and get a blended average return that's even higher and those are really the building blocks that get you up into that 7% to 10% range. And then add on top of that whatever you may for expected rising 30-year treasury yields over that period of time.","But Julien those are the building blocks we\u2019ve been providing and I think that 7% to 10% growth range that we\u2019ve given is very much in alignment with the building blocks that we provided.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And perhaps if you could elaborate a little bit more about the Illinois gas opportunity, it seems as if you\u2019ve driven of the CAGR a little bit from your last slide deck as best I can tell can. You talk about the timing on timing and growth out of that. And whether that was incorporated within your current CAGR?","Martin J. Lyons","It really is incorporated within that current CAGR to the extent that in this five-year period, we plan to enhance the investment in the gas portion of our business. If you do look at the CapEx that we historically have provided which is 13 to 17 and then CapEx in this period 14 to 18.","The overall I would say amount of capital expenditures of those five-year periods are about the same. But as you note there's been a bit added to the gas portion of the business and that really does reflect what we talked about last year that to the extent that we had a favorable legislation passed in Illinois, it would serve as the basis to invest more in that area for safety and reliability and that's been added to the mix.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And then sorry to keep going here, but last quick question on refining the debt here, what's kind of your thought process if you will in terms of size and I suppose how does that fit into your financing plan, what's your target capitalization if you can kind of remind us again as well?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure so maybe I\u2019ll talk about that overall. We had in one of our slides target capitalization of around 50%. And on slide 16 of our materials, we laid out our free cash flow for the year. This year we\u2019ve got negative free cash flow of about $800 million that's forecast.","In terms of debt maturities, Julien, I think the one you're referring to is the Ameren long-term debt issue of $425 million that comes due in May and provides us with a nice refinancing opportunity.","We\u2019ve also got a maturity in Missouri, a little over $100 million, and in January, we actually did move to redeem some debt at Ameren Illinois of about $160 million. So, when you add those things together, that's total funding needs of about $1.5 billion.","We plan to tackle that with a couple of debt offerings in Illinois this year which will -- we estimate will total about $600 million of long-term debt financings. We're planning the Missouri financing of about $350 million.","And then with respect to the Ameren parent both for the debt maturity as well as some of the funding that Ameren will be providing to ATXI as it begins to build its transmission project, the Illinois Rivers project we plan at Ameren Corp. to have a mix of long-term and short-term borrowings.","At this point, we're expecting a long-term offering that's something less than the current amount of the long-term debt that's out of Ameren Corp. So, something less than that $425 million.","Julien as you think about the capital expenditures that we show on slide 16 and we think about the where we\u2019re going to issue that long-term debt as I said of $600 million at Ameren Illinois, $350 million at Missouri. When we look at the capital expenditure, it\u2019s pretty clear obviously that we have about $760 million in Ameren Missouri.","At Ameren Illinois, we have $530 million for the energy delivery businesses, but it's also important to remember that a good portion of our transmission build is also within Ameren Illinois.","So, when you break that $510 million of FERC transmission, what you find is about -- in addition to the $530 million, I guess overall at Ameren Illinois we've got about $800 million of capital expenditures at Ameren Illinois.","So, when you think about where we're issuing that debt it\u2019s really at Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri for the most part of this coming year. There at the end of 2013, our equity ratios and the cap structures when you get the 10-K and you look at that it was 53% or north or 53%, both of those legal entities. So, what will happen is we issue some of these debt is those equity ratios will trend down somewhat into the approximately 51% kind of range.","And then overall, at Ameren, as you saw on our stats page, we\u2019re a little above 50% in terms of our equity content right now. I would expect that as we fund ATX and build that out, we should slip maybe a little below the 50%, but then trend back to our target ratio over time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you. Very thorough.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Lyons","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Congratulations on the promotion and the retirement guys?","Martin J. Lyons","Thank you, Paul. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to touch base with you on just the EPS growth rate on slide 15 and make sure I sort of understand this. The treasury yield of 4.5% in 2015 is there any sensitivity you can give us in terms of what the -- what that -- if we don't get interest rate sensitivity in terms of what your growth rate might be all things being equal?","Martin J. Lyons","Paul you're looking at particular slide 15 in 2015, earnings are just kind of overall--","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Whatever you can give us. You know I\u2019m saying I realize there a lot of moving parts.","Martin J. Lyons","Yeah. What we try to provide in terms of the longer-term guidance was just sort of a benchmark or an anchor point if you will. In Warner\u2019s talking points, one of the things he said is that all of the things being equal in our plan if treasury rates were to stay constant, we would expect to deliver an earnings growth rates that was slightly below the midpoint of the range that we provide of 7% to 10%.","It\u2019s not necessarily our belief that treasury yields are going to stay at the current levels, but wanted to provide that as a bit of an anchor point. Otherwise within that 7% to 10% growth, Paul as we talked about, we think it accommodates a range of treasury rate outcomes if you will or sales growth levels, spending levels, whether the capital or O&M and regulatory developments. We feel like again, Paul the building blocks are the ones they laid out earlier. It\u2019s the rate base growth, it\u2019s the reduction of parent another cost, it\u2019s the capital allocation to FERC-regulated transmission. Those are the things that are really going to drive the growth that we've got outlined.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And these SB 909 is the implementation of that sort of necessary for this growth rate or--?","Martin J. Lyons","No, I wouldn\u2019t say it's necessary for this growth rate. I think the outcome of that however; I\u2019d said is baked into our overall range of potential outcomes in terms of the 7% to 10%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the transmission build out. I know you guys are no longer a merchant, which is kind of nice, but can you tell us how you think that these transmission projects might impact power flows or congestion or what have you in terms of wholesale prices and perhaps how you\u2019d like to benefit your customers or anything else you could elaborate on that?","Martin J. Lyons","Yeah, I don't know that we'll get into all those specifics, but Maureen Borkowski is the Head of Transmission business was here with us this morning and I\u2019ll give her the opportunity to make, if she has any.","Maureen A. Borkowski","Yes, good morning with regard to the multi-value project that Ameren Transmission company at Illinois is building, those were approved by MISO for multiple reasons, basically to improve reliability, to enhance the accessibility of renewable resources, particularly wind, but also to improve the efficiency of the power market and that equates to congestion relief in the marketplace. So, yes that is the focus of those projects is to improve the efficiency of the markets as well as reliability of the customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Could you give us a sense of basis differential changes are nothing like there were any quantification on that sort of latter point?","Maureen A. Borkowski","I\u2019m sorry, but it really don't have any information like that. Again MISO did a pretty extensive analysis to define what their entire portfolio across MISO footprint, what savings those might be, but I don't have anything specific to our system.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ashar Khan from Visium. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","Good morning and congrats. I wanted to go, more on this dividend payout you gave a range and if I do my math correctly, next year we\u2019ll be at the lower portion of the payout. So I was just trying to see how is the Board thinking this year or next year?","I know you declared the dividend earlier this week or last week, is it something done for this year or is there a quarter we should look at some people have a quarter in which the increase the dividend every year?","Or how is the board looking at the dividend? Is it done for this year that we have the same rate and we look for next year? Or can it be reviewed later this year? Or could you just tell us the deliberations the Board might've gone through as you went through this new outlook of yours and the dividend staying constant as you declared it at the end of last week?","Thomas R. Voss","Yes, this is Tom Voss. I think we mentioned previously that the 55% to 70% payout ratio is what we hope for and we're somewhat at the high end of that this year. But the Board is very much engaged every quarter and looking at our earnings and our projections and they review it. And I would say that as we continue to grow earnings over this period, we hope to continue to grow our dividend.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning.","Martin J. Lyons","Good morning.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Senate Bill 909 if that were to pass, would that alter your 2% Missouri rate base CAGR?","Warner Baxter","Hey, Paul this is Warner. I think in the bigger picture what we have said, if we have constructive legislation passed that supports investment in Missouri, we would put more money to work. And so if you look at SB 909, which is a little bit than that we saw last year, we step back -- we think we would have the opportunity to put the work incremental investments in Missouri of say $50 million to $100 million per year should that legislation get passed in its current form. So simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe that we could put more money to work and we think it's absolutely a very good thing for the State of Missouri and its customers.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Would you borrow them from another bucket or would that the incremental capital?","Martin J. Lyons","Paul, this is Marty on that one. I think that really too soon to tell on that particular point. I will say that as we think about managing our overall capital expenditures, we're certainly mindful of impacts on customers rates, we're thinking about impacts on overall funding needs and we're also thinking about building a pipeline of investments beyond the five-year period that we've presented.","So, too soon to tell, but that is certainly a possibility that if we added investment opportunities there in the short-term in Missouri that other investment opportunities may slide to beyond the period presented. But again, really too early to say that. We'll get through this legislation -- legislative season and see where we\u2019re at and make those decisions in due course.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Is your guidance -- have you baked anything in to that for year-to-date weather?","Martin J. Lyons","No. Our guidance for 2014 is based on normal weather.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then lastly, given your tax position, do you expect to be a cash tax payer 2016?","Martin J. Lyons","As I mentioned earlier on the call, we expect that the NOLs and the tax credit carry-forwards that we have to provide us a benefit out through the 2016 timeframe.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Through or to, sorry?","Martin J. Lyons","Into 2016.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Into. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hey guys, congratulations on a good year and a lot of strong accomplishments during 2013. I want to ask just a question about 2014 guidance, which if I just use the midpoint of your guidance range implies almost like 11% or 12% year-over-year growth and then therefore its I think about 7% to 10% implies a much lower growth rate after 2014, am I thinking about that the right way? Am I missing something and how should we think about the puts and takes on that?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, you're right the growth between 2013 and 2014 is certainly significant and it\u2019s driven by the items I highlighted. But Michael obviously you can do the math. As you look at our 2014 guidance range and you look out to the overall growth we've given out period 2018. But if you take that midpoint of 2014 and project out, you still got a really solid growth rate of around 6% to 9.5% in terms of where that range ends up. So, you're right there was a solid amount of growth in 2013 to 2014 and it moderate somewhat from there, but still very solid growth rate off 2014.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And it strikes me that you're a few years from a dividend policy question. You\u2019re a few years away from -- like you would get if I just use midpoint of guidance, you would get to the middle point of your dividend growth rate -- your dividend payout ratio in 2015 at the current dividend level like $1.60 at I don't know $2.50 or so of earnings in 2015 and I know you're not really giving 2015 guidance I'm just slapping the growth rate on 2014. That still gets you into the low 60s payout ratio, but by 2016 or 2017, your expectation as to grow the dividend with earnings growth?","Martin J. Lyons","Michael just to reiterate or repeat what Tom said, which is that as we grow the earnings. We aspire to be able to grow the dividend. We're not giving out I'd say an expected timing or amount of growth in the dividend. But as Tom has previously said on prior calls, we don't necessarily think that we need to get into the bottom end of the range before we would grow the dividend.","There are a number of factors that are considered. Tom laid those out a few moments ago. Just in terms of our earnings outlook, but also our capital funding, our cash flows, things of that nature. A number of those things are laid out as you've seen in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs that the Board considers, but -- I guess that's about what about to say on that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay. And then last question just on capital spending because you're investing a good amount of capital in concurrent return businesses like FERC-regulated transmission. Of the transmission investment for 2014, how much of that is ATXI versus Ameren Illinois?","Martin J. Lyons","Let's see if I can do my math here real quick. I think it's about that $510 million -- I think it\u2019s about $270 million is Ameren Illinois and the remainder is ATXI.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it. So, not quite 50\/50, but pretty close. Cool. Guys, thank you. I appreciate you taking my questions. And once again congrats on a great 2013.","Martin J. Lyons","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Bischof of Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Bischof - Morningstar, Inc.","Hi good morning. I got just a few follow-on questions in terms of Missouri. I guess in terms of reducing lag, are your efforts solely on Bill 909 or are there other initiatives that we should be thinking about there?","And then in terms of the potential $50 million to $100 million capital spend, can you provide us a little bit more color on what with these investments are?","Warner Baxter","Andy, this is Warner. With regard to Missouri, we're not putting all of our marbles into legislation. We have been working for years to align our spending and to be consistent with the existing regulatory framework in Missouri and we've been successful and that focus, that relentless focus on disciplined cost management will continue.","So, there are a host of initiatives that we\u2019ve taken and we'll continue to take including things like lean initiatives that are being taken place across our enterprise, coupled with again disciplined management of our discretionary capital.","And as we discussed a little bit earlier, you put those factors together, we continue to believe that we\u2019ll be able to align our spend with existing regulatory framework. Of course, as we said earlier, we're going to be going in for an electric rate case later this year to true up our rates as well as cost. And so that obviously will help and certainly help mitigate the regulatory lag that we're experiencing associated with the infrastructure investment in our enterprise.","That's probably one of the biggest sources of regulatory lag that we have today and indeed SB 909 will -- is squarely about trying to address the regulatory lag associated with those investments. And Marty I think there's a question on capital investment. Andy if you could follow-up make sure -- ","Martin J. Lyons","He was just asking what kinds of projects might be involved in that, Warner.","Warner Baxter","So, when you look at our existing spend this year we have two major projects that we discussed a little bit earlier, the Callaway reactor vessel head as well as the precipitator project. We also have some new substations that we have to bring on. They are at their aging infrastructure and so we have to address some of those. As well is we have renewable energy project. The largest solar facility investor own facility in the State, we're going to get that done by the end of the year as well.","So, looking ahead, we see that we have a need to invest incremental monies, discretionary monies into things like substations into things like our power plants, certainly in things trying to automate our system in a better way, and ultimately we'll have to address -- and maybe even meters that we use in Missouri. So, we see a real need in investing in our aging infrastructure and that's what SB 909 is all about to try and do that on a -- in a more timely fashion.","Andy Bischof - Morningstar, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And congrats on the promotions and retirement.","Warner Baxter","Thank you. Thank you, Andy ","Martin J. Lyons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good morning.","Martin J. Lyons","Good morning.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So, I was wondering you mentioned -- I think you're looking for declines in sales volumes for 2014, but it looks like you had slight increases for 2013. So, if you give a little more color on just what you're seeing in customer growth and demand, particularly residential customer growth and then on the industrial side for demand in your service territories?","Martin J. Lyons","Sure, Dan, this is Marty. Thanks for calling and thanks the question. You're right in terms of what we saw this past year. Of course the sales numbers that you see are -- on the stats page are affected by weather, but stripping out weather.","We did see some growth this year in both Missouri and Illinois in residential and commercial categories. Overall, on a weather-normalized basis, we estimate that residential and commercial sales grew about 0.6%. Coming into the year that's about where we expect in somewhere between 0% and 0.5% of growth and so sort of towards the upper end of that range at 0.6%.","We actually did see customer counts in both Missouri and Illinois go up in terms of residential and commercial customer count. So, that was certainly positive in 2013 versus the prior year. Overall, on industrial, we did see a decline in sales of about 3.2% overall.","Missouri, which was positive up about 1% in 2013 in industrial, so that was a good sign while Illinois was down about 6%. And I spoke to that of the earlier calls that we've seen some weakness in Illinois in the manufacturing sector in metals and equipment, those types of things and unfortunately, in Illinois we've been seeing employment -- unemployment recently bump up while national average has been coming down and we've also seen unemployment in Missouri coming down.","So, Illinois unfortunately in recent months have seen unemployment-wise and industrial sales wise to be trending in a negative direction. Missouri seems to be trending in a little bit of a positive direction.","But looking forward to 2014, what we're expecting is a decline as we mentioned in the call in residential and commercial sales. And while we expect to see still slow improvement in the economy and jobs, housing starts et cetera, we do believe that both federal energy efficiency as well as state energy efficiency measures reduced sales and have -- and impacted reducing sales in 2014 compared to 2013.","And as I mentioned on the call and our prepared remarks, it is important to remember that in Missouri, we do have an energy efficiency program whereby we\u2019re -- made hole for the cost of our energy efficiency programs and even provided some incentives with regards to that.","In 2013, we estimated that had an impact on our residential sales of about 0.8% and about 0.1% on commercial. And then as I said, we\u2019re -- made hole for the cost of that. So as you think about 2014, you think about those impacts of the residential and commercial sales going down. They are mitigated in Missouri by what we call our MIA funding programs. As well as in Illinois, it's important to remember that under our formulaic rates, there\u2019s a 50 basis points color around the earned ROE.","With respect to industrial sales, we\u2019re expecting really be down across the two states about 0.7%. We\u2019re expecting to see declines in both states. In Missouri, it\u2019s somewhat specific to some expected customer load that we do expect to see go away. And then in Illinois, I would say its -- continued concerns about general economic weakness.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then on Missouri, given that you're planning to file for a rate increase. I was wondering if you be able to what your ROE in Missouri in 2013 and the year-end rate base?","Martin J. Lyons","I don't really have the year-end rate base. I think you can go ahead and calculate the ROE I think by referencing the number on the stats page. I don't have that in front of me either, the exact net income. But as we look ahead, as we mentioned, we do see the need for a rate filing which we expect to make in July.","I think in our prior calls we\u2019ve said in the second half and as I've mentioned before really a primary driver of that filing that we plan to make in July has to deal with a significant capital expenditures that we're making in Missouri.","We talked about the electrostatic precipitators at Labadie; we talked about the Callaway reactor head that Warner just mentioned a little while ago, some of the solar installations that we're doing in Missouri as well.","I think if you want to look at rate base, I think the closest is to maybe go back to page eight of our slides and we do have a year-end rate base pie where we break some of the information out. And I think you can find an estimate of the Missouri rate base at the end of 2013 there.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I just wanted to add my congratulations to Tom and Warner on their upcoming changes.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Thomas R. Voss","Thank you, Dan. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","I had just two questions on Missouri. The first can you talk about the impact the Noranda complaints may or may not have an upcoming rate case? And the second, when you see the headwinds associated with getting SB 909 past?","Warner Baxter","Hi. This is Warner. I think with regard to the Noranda complaint case, we don't it having any impact on our ability to file and execute the rate case that we plan on doing in July. We were clear last November that we needed to file rate case in the second half and now we\u2019ve sharpen our pencil and it\u2019s going to be July and we plan to execute that in a timely fashion. And I'm sorry you had a second question that was?","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","The major headwinds you see with SB 909?","Warner Baxter","The reality is this as you know the legislative process; it's a dynamic process, so ultimately is always difficult to predict the prospects of the passage of any bill. I'll tell you what I do know. I do know that Missouri must make progress and really modernizing its framework to support investment. And if the message that is understood by many key leaders in the legislature and frankly, many stakeholders around the state and so as we continue to have more discussions with the general assembly in other key stakeholders around the state about SB 909.","Our message is this is an important step forward. As I said before, there\u2019s an incremental step, it\u2019s an important step forward and it can start making progress on the aging infrastructure in Missouri.","So, I'm not going to be able to hand cap. I\u2019m -- we do believe that there will likely be some groups that will oppose the bill, but that's probably true with every bill. But one thing I can tell you our team is going to be very focused on this legislation over the next several months.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. And good luck.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bill Appicelli with Nexus Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Appicelli - Nexus Asset Management","Hi, good morning.","Martin J. Lyons","Hey, Bill.","Bill Appicelli - Nexus Asset Management","I just had a question on the financing. You had asked or you had mentioned that you didn't expect to issue equity through 2018, but that you would evaluate use of a DRIP. And I know in the past you had talked about the potential for $75 million to $100 million maybe using that. I mean looking at your base plan, do you -- should we assume that there's DRIP been utilized in terms of that growth path that gets you to slightly below the midpoint that you talked about?","Martin J. Lyons","Bill I'd say that's one of the things that probably I\u2019ll leave up to you to kind of factor in. You should look at your model. I mean -- what we plan to do here today was just -- again give this guidance range of 7% to 10%. There's a range of potential things that could affect our results that we outlined there that could put us into the upper or lower end of that range.","In terms of the treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments and we're simply same. We leave the option open as we encounter these various changes to issue shares as needed through the DRIP or 401-K.","We don't really see the need over that five-year plan for a public equity issuance as we said in the slides. And we'll evaluate the need for the DRIP or 401-K on a year-to-year basis. You're right about the number that we previously said which is if we did I'll say turn that on, it would be about estimated $75 million to $100 million.","Bill Appicelli - Nexus Asset Management","Okay. And then just changing gears, do you guys have any update on the status or timeline resolution of the challenge at FERC around the MISO ROEs?","Martin J. Lyons","I'll let Maureen go ahead and answer that as well.","Maureen A. Borkowski","Yes. In January, the Midwest ISO transmission orders filed their response to the complaint requesting that FERC dismiss it because the complaint, it\u2019s really had met the burden of that the rate is just unreasonable. They provided additional information as well about errors in the calculation in the complaint.","At this point in time, others have also filed their responses, but FERC has not taken any action or set any kind of schedule. So, at this point time, we're really in a wait-and-see mode. We do have confidence though that the FERC Commission is still very pro-transmission development and they understand that the return on equity components are very important element of continuing to encourage transmission investments. So, we're hopeful that the outcome will be positive.","Bill Appicelli - Nexus Asset Management","Okay, great. Thank you.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital Inc.","Thank you. And congratulations Tom and Warner.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Greg. Really appreciate that. Thank you.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital Inc.","So, I think maybe you touched on this already, but I just wanted to come back to it in terms the growth post-2014. With 2014 being an accelerated rate, is it sort of 6% to 9.5% post that? Should we think about it that way? Then I have one detailed question.","Martin J. Lyons","Yeah Greg and I'll let you do a follow-up. Yes and that would be answer that I gave -- this is Marty, by the way. As you know as simply coming off of the midpoint of our 2014 guidance and just looking at -- I mean you can -- as I said earlier, you can do the math if you\u2019re taking the 2013 base in the kid the 7% to 10% growth out 2018, calculate a number and then bring it back to the implied growth off the 2014 midpoint. And you come up with a 6% to 9.5% kind of growth rate off of 2014 over that period.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital Inc.","And then if you come back to slide 15, the negative driver there just higher cost in Missouri and otherwise is there any -- anything more that you could provide detail on there? Or, is it really just a thought about the impact of regulatory lag in Missouri?","Martin J. Lyons","Yeah. I think that Greg obviously we're trying to do on slide 15 is just provide some of what we considered to be the meaningful drivers of earnings considerations for 2013. As I said before, as we think about the Missouri electric rate case, we would plan to file that in July of this year, July of 2014. So you would expect the normal 11 month resolution with a rate increase in June.","And so -- again we're time in the rate case certainly to pick up these large capital investments that we're making this year, but in the early part of 2015, given the Missouri regulatory framework, you would expect to have some regulatory lag of the results of those investments when you think about depreciation, property taxes, potential for some incremental O&M cost in 2015. And then the rate increase would kick in that June timeframe of 2013.","And then you would lay out just a number of other drivers which we've got. As the formula rates in Illinois, the investments we're making there in both the gas and electric portions of our business and of course, the investments we're making in the transmission. And then as the reduction -- somewhat incremental reduction would expect to get in the parent and other costs going into 2013.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Martin J. Lyons","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Fischer for any additional concluding comments.","Douglas Fischer","Before we complete our call today, Warner and Tom have some closing remarks. Warner?","Warner Baxter","Thanks. I know it\u2019s been a long call and I thank you for your interest in the company, but we do have a couple of closing comments. As I said at the outset, I'm very, very humbled and honored to follow in Tom\u2019s footsteps.","I think as you all know his strong leadership over these past five years has delivered tremendous value to our shareholders and I can tell you his leadership has also delivered tremendous value to our customers and all the communities that we serve.","I think it's important to know that Tom's strong leadership has also positioned Ameren and our team to continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders and customers and frankly, the communities we serve in the future.","He has demonstrated commitment to safety, diversity, and service to our shareholders, our customers and our communities as well as a generation of Ameren coworkers for 45 years it's simply unequaled.","So, Tom on behalf of our entire Ameren team, I want to thank you for your tremendous leadership and I just want to personally thank you for being such a fine mentor and a friend to me. So thank you, Tom.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Warner. This is my final quarterly earnings call for Ameren and I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts. It's been an honor to lead this great company for these past five years. I\u2019m pleased that during this time, our team developed a clear vision and strategy for the future and made significant progress on executing that strategy.","My many years at the company have been very rewarding. I've always said that the secret a great career is to be able to say that you love what you do, while you do it, and who you do it with. I can tell you that I have really enjoyed working with our Board of Directors, our leadership team and coworkers for the benefit of Ameren shareholders and customers.","I've also enjoyed interacting with so many of you in the investment community. Warner has been with Ameren for nearly 20 years and has served in a wide variety of leadership roles in Finance and Operations. I have absolute confidence in his ability to lead Ameren and that he will continue to execute on as well is enhance Ameren\u2019s growth strategy.","Douglas Fischer","This is Doug.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that's accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.","To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com Web site home page that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on page two of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as Forward-Looking Statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-Looking Statement section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC.","Lastly, all our per share earnings amounts discussed today during today's presentation including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.","Now here's Warner, who will start on page four of the presentation.","Warner Baxter","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced third quarter 2018 core earnings of $1.50 per share compared to core earnings of $1.24 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Third quarter 2018 results exclude non-cash non-core charge of $0.05 per share related to federal income tax reform.","The year-over-year increase was driven by higher retail sales, primarily due to warmer summer temperatures, as well as earnings on increased infrastructure investments. The comparison also benefited from timing differences related to federal income tax reform, which we do not expect will impact full-year results. Marty will discuss these and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment.","I am also pleased to report that we continue to successfully execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which I will touch on in more detail in a few moments.","That fact [ph], and coupled with strong retail sales primarily due to the warm summer weather enabled us to raise our 2018 earnings guidance for the second time this year. Our 2018 core earnings guidance range is now $3.35 per share to $3.45 per share, up from our prior GAAP and core guidance range of $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share.","Moving to page five, here we reiterate our strategic plan which we have been executing very well throughout 2018, and over the last several years. That plans is expected to continue to result in strong long-term investments and earnings growth. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This strategy has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in jurisdictions that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks.","Today, I am pleased to say that we are allocating meaningful amounts of capital to each of our business segments as all are now operating under constructive frameworks. On September 1st, Ameren Missouri began using plant and service accounting enabled by Senate Bill 564. This legislation improves our ability to earn a fair return on Ameren Missouri capital investments, and will drive significant incremental investments in energy infrastructure in the future. I'll say more about Senate Bill 564 in a moment. But it is safe to say that we are excited to bring many of the same infrastructure investment benefits to Missouri that our Illinois customers enjoy today.","Speaking about our Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas distribution operations, we invested approximately $625 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first nine months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plans. The electric projects, enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, have exceeded the job creation goals, and we are on track to meet or exceed our investment, reliability, and advance metering goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades.","Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches, and an upgraded distribution grid have resulted in a 19% reduction in annual electricity service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 17% faster on average than prior to when the program began. Further, installations of advanced electric meters and gas meter modules were either on or ahead of schedule. Through the end of September, Ameren Illinois has installed about 985,000 smart electric meters, and 510,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.","Ameren Illinois is working to deploy the devices to all of its 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers by the end of 2019. Additionally, the investments in infrastructure enabled by this constructive energy policy have created thousands of new jobs in Illinois. Finally, we've been able to make all of these investments and create jobs while keeping rates low for customers. To give you some perspective, if our annual electric rate update is approved by the ICC, as requested, all-in 2019 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy service from Ameren Illinois will have decreased by an estimated 1% since electric formula rate making began in 2012. Even after incorporating substantial infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers.","With regard to our Illinois natural gas operations, our transmission and distribution projects are focused on upgrading and modernizing our gas main and equipment infrastructure, all to strengthen the safety and reliability of our system. Many of these projects were enabled by the qualified infrastructure plant rider which improves our ability to recover costs more timely between rate reviews. Being mindful of the recent gas distribution issues experienced in the North East, I will note that our Ameren Gas Distribution System is comprised almost entirely of plastic and protected coated steel pipelines. There is no cast iron or uncoated bare steel pipe in our system. In addition, our gas distribution system operates with individual service pressure regulators at 99.9% of our customers, nearly every customer meter.","Moving now to our Ameren Transmission business, where we've invested approximately $400 million through September of this year. We continue to make significant investments in local reliability projects needed to comply with the North American Electric Liability Corporation requirements, as well as our two remaining regional multi-value projects, Mark Twain, and Illinois Rivers, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2019, as planned. These investments, enabled by the constructive FERC regulatory framework continue to bring value through safe, reliable, resilient, and efficient transmission systems.","In summary, constructive and forward-thinking electric and gas regulatory frameworks across the board are driving important investments that are delivering significant long-term benefits for our customers. Of course, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy is achieving constructive outcomes in regulatory proceedings. As Marty will cover in more detail later, we had been very busy in Illinois managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings. We have been making solid progress in settling important issues with key stakeholders, including agreements, in August, with the ICC staff and all other active parties on all issues in our pending electric and natural gas distribution rate reviews.","We expect final decisions from the ICC in these proceedings by year-end, and potentially as early as this week. In Missouri, last week the PSC approved Ameren Missouri's request for a certificate of convenience and necessity, or CCN, to construct and own a 400 megawatt wind generation project. This approval, which came within just five months of our request, followed a unanimous settlement reached earlier this month with all parties to the CCN request. Further, we have settled with all parties for us of the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism, or RESRAM, for this wind project and other qualifying renewable energy investments.","However, there is one unresolved issue as the Office of Public Council opposes recovery through the RESRAM of a 15% of capital cost not recovered by PISA [ph]. This matter will go to hearing today. We expect a decision from Missouri PSC by January, 2019. In another positive development, earlier this month, Ameren Missouri reached a unanimous settlement with respect to a proposed new energy efficiency plan. This proposed plan would begin in March 2019, and would follow on the heels of our previous successful energy efficiency plans, the first of which began in 2013. If approved by the Missouri PSC, Ameren Missouri intends to invest $226 million over the life of the plan.","Like our prior plans, we believe the new plan appropriately balances customer and shareholder interests by providing for timely recovery of both energy efficiency program costs and revenue losses resulting from these programs. The proposed plan also provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn a performance incentive if certain customer energy efficiency goals are achieved, including $30 million if 100% of the goals are achieved by 2022. A similar incentive to the prior two energy efficiency plans. We expect a decision from the Missouri PSC on the proposed energy efficiency plan later this year.","Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, keep rates affordable, and keep earnings returns close to allow returns in all of our jurisdictions.","Turning now to page six, next I want to briefly cover the second part of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the years, we have been successful on executing this element of our strategy through extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Ameren Missouri began to use Plant-in-Service Accounting on September 1st, which was enabled by the enactment of Senate Bill 564, this year. This legislation will drive significant investment in energy infrastructure, while providing robust consumer protections.","This provision applies to all qualifying infrastructure investments that we outlined during our conference call in February, and enables approximately $1 billion in incremental investment for 2023 to modernize Missouri's electric grid, including the installation of smart meters and the deployment of other advanced technologies. These incremental grid modernization investments are expected to be largely additive to our five-year capital expenditure plan, as well as a strong 7% compound annual rate-based growth from 2018 through 2022 that we outlined in February. This legislation will also drive economic development in Missouri by creating significant good-paying jobs from these investments.","In addition, Senate Bill 564 includes a meaningful economic development incentive for new or expanding large energy users consisting of a 40% discount in rates for up to five years. This was a key factor in helping attract a $65 million facility to Ameren Missouri, which is expected to add 300 new jobs to the region. We believe this is just the beginning of businesses taken advantage of this new incentive. As I've said before, I strongly believe that Senate Bill 564 will deliver significant long-term benefits for our customers, the State of Missouri, and our shareholders.","Moving on to page seven for an update on our wind generation investment plans, which is directly tied to the third pillar of our strategy grading and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. We continue to make progress in Ameren Missouri's proposed investment in at least 700 megawatts or approximately $1 billion, but one generation to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard. As I mentioned, the Missouri PSC approved our CCM request to construct and own a 400-megawatt wind generation facility in northeast Missouri, which when build will be the largest ever in the state.","In addition, earlier this month we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of EDF renewables to acquire after construction a wind generation facility of up to 157 megawatts to be located in Northwest Missouri, and just last week, we follow-up our CCM with the Missouri PSC for this project. We have requested the Missouri PSC to issue its final order on the CCM request at May 1, 2019. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our plans to pursue ownership of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation. Today, we have reached agreements to acquire up to 557 megawatts, which would need about 80% of our compliance needs. And as I just noted, we have made significant progress on regulatory approvals.","Of course, we're not done; our team continues to actively negotiate with several developers to meet our remaining wind generation plans. We remain focused on completing these negotiations which may continue into early next year. Given the strong progress we have made today, we remain confident in our ability to complete these negotiations and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely fashion. We look forward to updating you on our progress on this important component of Ameren Missouri's integrated resource plan during our year-end conference call next February because we believe it will deliver clear long-term benefits to our customers, the environment, and the communities we serve.","Turning now to page eight, in February, we rolled forward a five-year growth plan which included our expectation of 5% to 7% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2017 to 2022 period even 2017 core earnings per share as a base. This earnings growth outlook was primarily driven by expected 7% compound annual rate-based growth over the same period.","Importantly, our five-year rate-based growth projections did not include approximately $1 billion of incremental Ameren Missouri capital expenditures for 2023 associated with the enactment of Senate Bill 564 or the proposed incremental Ameren Missouri investment of approximately $1 billion in wind generation by 2020. These incremental investments are expected to be largely additive to Ameren Missouri's overall five-year plan outline in February.","We are well underway in updating our capital plan and we will provide an update to our long-term growth plans during our year-end conference call next February. With constructive regulatory frameworks to support investment now in all of our business segments, I believe we are well positioned to continue to execute our strategy that will deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. And I believe, we will be able to make these investments while keeping rates affordable and competitive as we leverage the host of opportunities to reduce our costs, including those related to income taxes, delivered fuel, other operations and maintenance and interest expenses.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal during the third quarter. Our operations were solid and our investments are delivering results, which contributed to improve reliability. Our earnings were strong and as a result, we increased our 2018 earnings guidance for the second time this year. We reach key settlements on the Illinois electric distribution and natural gas rate reviews, as well as Missouri's 400-megawatt wind generation CCM filing, which led to quick approval by the Missouri PSC.","We officially elected to use planned service account in the Missouri as provided and in a Senate Bill 564, which we expect will strengthen our already strong infrastructure investment plans and rate-based growth outlook. And this month, we reached a key settlement on Ameren Missouri's New Energy Efficiency plan filing and also entered into an agreement to acquire after construction, another wind generation facility for up to 157 megawatts.","Finally, this month, Ameren's Board of Directors express its competence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximate 4%, the fifth consecutive year with the dividend increase. Simply put, we are doing we said we would do, we are executing that strategic plan across all of our businesses, which is driving our strong long-term earnings growth outlook, which when combined with our solid dividend yield, currently about 3%, we believe results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. The bottom line is that we are delivering superior long-term benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and you our shareholders.","Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty, Marty?","Marty Lyons","Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to page 10 of our presentation; today, we reported third quarter 2018 gap earnings of $1.45 per share, compared to gap earnings of $1.18 cents per share for the year ago quarter. Excluding third quarter 2018 and 2017 non-core non-cash charges for the revaluation of deferred taxes of $0.05 and $0.06 per share respectively. Ameren reported third quarter core earnings of $1.50 per share compared to core earnings of $1.24 per share for the third quarter of 2017.","The third quarter 2018 charge reflects the true up to the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with federal income tax reform resulting primarily from recently issued regulations related to the application of bonus depreciation to 2017.","Turning now to page 11, the key factors that drove the overall $0.26 per share increase in core earnings are highlighted by segment on this page. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment and also the largest driver of the year-over-year earnings improvement reported an increase of $0.25 per share from $0.97 per share in 2017 to $1.22 per share in 2018. This improvement was driven in part by a $0.16 per share timing difference between income tax expense and revenue reductions related to federal tax reform which we do not expect will impact full-year results.","In addition, the comparison benefited from higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales primarily due to warmer summer temperatures compared to near normal temperatures in the year ago period, which contributed approximately $0.07 per share. For perspective, the weather benefit was largely driven by September temperatures which rank as the third hottest in St. Louis over the last 50 years. These favorable impacts were partially offset by a planned increase in other operations and maintenance expenses of $0.03 per share.","Turning to the other segments' earnings for Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution were up $0.04 and $0.03 respectively reflecting increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's earnings benefited from a higher allowed return on equity under formulated rate making of 8.9% compared to 8.7% for the prior year. The 2018 allowed ROE was based on the 2018 average 30-year treasury yield of 3.1% up from the 2017 average of 2.9%.","Finally, Ameren Parent and Other results reflected lower net state and federal tax benefits as well as delusion.","In summary, we had a strong third quarter that contributed to increased year-to-date earnings across each of our four operating segments. Details on the year-to-date results are provided in the appendix of our presentation.","Before moving on, I will briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first nine months of this year compared to the first nine months of last year. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increased a little over 1% excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan under EMEA. Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers also increased a little over 1% after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude the effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.","Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis increase about 1%, while kilowatt hour sales to Illinois Industrial customers increased about 2.5%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter cost do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Overall, the economies in both states remain stable to positive with unemployment in Ameren Missouri's territory at about 3.2%, in Ameren Illinois territory at about 4.3% compared to the national average of 3.7%.","Moving to page 12 of our presentation, I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2018 earnings guidance.","Today we raised our 2018 GAAP guidance range to $3.30 per share to $3.40 per share, up from our prior range of $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share. This updated GAAP guidance includes the third quarter non-cash tax related charge of $0.05 per share I discussed earlier. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2018 core earnings within a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, a $0.35 per share increase in the midpoint as compared to our original guidance range of $2.95 to $3.15 per share issued in February. The increase reflects higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales primarily due to the year-to-date weather benefit of $0.27 per share as well as continued solid execution of our strategy. This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the remaining three months of this year.","Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2018 earnings to last year's fourth quarter earnings. Some of the larger items include the absence of the non-core, non-cash charge in the fourth quarter 2017 for the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with federal tax reform.","The absence of the fourth quarter 2017 Ameren Missouri Callaway refueling and maintenance outage as well as the expected reversal in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the $0.12 per share year-to-date timing difference between income tax expense and revenue reductions at Ameren Missouri also associated with federal tax reform.","Before moving on, I would also like mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt in November to repay $313 million of maturing 9.75% senior secured notes and refinance short-term debt. We expect savings on Ameren Illinois financing cost to be passed directly to Ameren Illinois electric transmission and distribution customers through formula rates as well to its natural gas customers as a result of the new natural gas rates based on 2019 future test year.","Moving now to page 13 for a discussion of select regulatory matters starting with Ameren Missouri, as Warner mentioned, pursuant to Senate Bill 564, Ameren Missouri elected to use plant-in-service accounting or PISA effective September 1. PISA allows us to defer and recover 85% of depreciation expense and return on rate base related to qualifying plant placed in service after September 1.","On this page, we have provided information to help assist in modeling PISA. I would like to note a return on rate base as well as on accumulated PISA deferrals will reflect Ameren Missouri's pretax weighted average cost of capital. However, accounting rules only allow for the recognition in earnings of Ameren Missouri's cost of debt until such deferrals are reflected in rates. Therefore, the incremental return on equity will be recognized in earnings when deferred amounts are recovered in rates over the 20-year period following subsequent rate reviews.","Turning to page 14, regarding Ameren transmission regulatory matters, there have been recent developments that may impact the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners. Earlier this month, the FERC issued an order addressing a prior court ruling in the New England ROE case. In its order, the FERC proposed a new methodology for determining the base allowed ROE and then soliciting feedback from participants. A final FERC order in the New England case is not expected until 2019. And we are unable to predict any potential impacts it will have in the pending MISO complaint case. Further, it remains uncertain when the FERC will issue any orders in the pending MISO case.","Moving to page 15 and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution regulatory matters, in April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula rate making we are required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recovery of such cost.","In August, the ICC staff issued its recommendation which was an agreement with Ameren Illinois' request. A decision is expected by December with new rates expected to be effective by January 2019. Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas regulatory matters, earlier this year we filed with the ICC for an increase in gas distribution rate using 2019 future test year.","In late August, we updated our request to incorporate a stipulation agreement with the ICC staff and other active parties on all issues, including a 9.87% ROE, a 50% equity ratio, and $1.6 billion of rate base. A decision is expected by December with new rates expected to be effective by January 2019.","Turning to page 16, we plan to provide 2019 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2018 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with Missouri, we expect to return to normal weather in 2019 with decreased Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.27 compared to 2018 results to date and assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year.","Further, we expect the expenses for the scheduled spring 2019 Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to decrease earnings by approximately $0.10. The 2019 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably impacted by the full-year application of PISA to a higher level of infrastructure investments as well as by lower other operations and maintenance expenses.","The expected lower other operations and maintenance expenses are primarily due to the higher than normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outages experienced this year. Next, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula rate making.","Ameren transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change positive or negative to the current allowed ROE of 10.82%. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2019 compared to 2018 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula rate making. The allowed ROE under the formula will be the average 2019 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. The allowed ROE formula will serve as a natural hedge should interest rates rise. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Distribution, earnings will benefit from higher delivery service rates based on the 2019 future test year and an increase in the allowed ROE.","Turning to page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2018 core earnings within a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by a rate base growth and disciplined financial management. And we believe Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. The combination of our growth outlook and attractive dividend yield provides total shareholder return potential that we believe compares very favorably to our peers.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robison Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning.","Ali Agha","My first question, as you mentioned with your year-end results, you will update your long term growth forecast as well. I just wanted to get some clarity, what's the base year you are going to use, and are you going to extend it to '23? How are you going to deal with the weather impact, just curious how you are thinking about long-term growth as you look to update that for us.","Marty Lyons","Sure, again, good morning, Ali. Look, we're giving that consideration at this point in terms of what would be the best approach. They mentioned last call one logical approach would be to utilize the 2018 base, but as you noted we have to consider and be mindful of sort of the non-core items, the weather impacts, the timing of Calloway outages and the like. So using that 2018 is an alternative, but there are other alternatives as well that we'll be thinking through. To your point, with respect to CapEx and rate base, we certainly do expect to roll forward our outlook for CapEx and rate base out through 2023. And then we'll step back and think about what's the best approach in terms of providing the related earnings per share guidance.","Ali Agha","Okay. And second question, Marty as you're thinking about incorporating that incremental CapEx from Missouri Senate Bill 564 and the wind into your planning, can you remind us how much capacity do you have right now in your mind to increase holding company debt beyond current levels or should we be thinking that any external funding at the parent likely will be coming from equity, just because some framework on how that funding plays out?","Marty Lyons","Sure, Ali, yes, as we think about back to the earnings per share guidance that we give long-term, obviously, we'd not only incorporate the additions associated with the capital expenditures for 564 wind related investments and other investments, we certainly step back also and think about what's the right financing plan for all of that. As I said before, and on prior calls and conversations, we will take into consideration a number of things as we think about how best to finance the plan. We're thinking about maintaining the strong balance sheet, that's sort of been a hallmark of our operations over time. We're very happy with the credit ratings that we have today.","We've worked hard over time to improve our business risk and achieve those credit ratings. So we'll be mindful, also of the credit metrics that relate to those ratings. We'll also be thinking of course, about these investments and you know positioning these for success as we have flow through with regulatory processes. You know, all of that with the backdrop of certainly thinking about how to maximize shareholder value. So you know, I can't tell you exactly or give you a number in terms of exactly how much balance sheet capacity we think about in terms of additional holding company debt, but I think those other considerations that I laid out are the primary ones that we think about.","Ali Agha","Got it. Last question, just as you think about this potential billion dollars of additional CapEx over five years in Missouri, can you remind us how much capacity do you have to potentially increase that, because I know there's a rate cap test and other tests that come into play as well, but theoretically, how much more capacity would you have if you had opportunities to go above the billion dollars?","Marty Lyons","Yes, in terms of the rate cap, you're absolutely right. I mean, what we have in Missouri is under the new 564 regime that we embarked upon on September 1st is that we need to stay under a 2.85% compound annual growth rate through 2023 with the beginning of that growth rate reflecting the rate case outcome we had last spring. Of course as it related to that base, we get to take into account half of the savings from the federal tax benefit. But look, Ali, I think as we go ahead, as we said, you know, we expected that adoption of 564 would allow us to invest that incremental $ billion.","Going back a couple of years, we laid out under over a 10-year period, the opportunity to invest an additional $4 billion of capital over a 10-year period. So, clearly as we look out there are other investments that we think that we could make over time for the benefit of our customers. And we'll be considering which of those investments we think are prudent to make over time and at what time as we think about planning that, planning out our projects and executing them well.","So look, I think our goal over time is to deploy capital in a prudent way to improve service to our customers. As Warner said earlier, to benefit our communities, to add jobs, and we'll be thinking about how best to do that and stay under that cap. I will tell you as it relates to the cap, we said this before, some of the things that we do see as opportunities to help us in terms of the areas of cost, not only are the savings from the federal taxes which we were able to utilize just here earlier this year to reduce customer rate 6%, but we also see continuing opportunities from re-financings of higher cost debt. We've got about $650 million of maturities between now and 2020 at higher rates than exists today.","We've seen opportunity to lower financing costs for our customers. We also see the opportunity to realize benefits from lower delivered fuel costs, which we'll begin to see the savings from that this year and into next year. And over time also we'll look to keep tight controls on our O&M expenses. And certainly as we roll out some of the grid modernization benefits or grid modernization investments, certainly look for opportunities to utilize those also to keep tight control on our O&M.","Warner Baxter","Ali, this is Warner. I think that Marty did a great job summarizing. I think to summarize it we have a deep pipeline of investments that can bring significant benefits to our customers not just in Missouri but frankly across the board, and secondly, Marty outlined a host of cost opportunities for affordability to keep our customer rates low not just in Missouri but across the Board. So we look at the pipeline, plus affordability is going to continue to have us move forward with a strong, sustainable growth plan.","Ali Agha","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, can you hear me?","Warner Baxter","We can hear you fine, thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. So perhaps just to clarify the last question a little bit further, where do you stand with respect to your - debt targets with the agencies and how much latitude do you have with that respect just to ask it a slightly different way?","Marty Lyons","Yes, sure, Julien, this is Marty again. At our credit rating, the issuer ratings and we list these in the appendix to our slides. At S&P we got a BBB plus with a positive outlook. The FFO to debt threshold they've set for us there is just 13%. As it relates to Moody's, the parent issuer ratings BAA1 and the threshold they've set there for us on FFO to debt is 19%. So those are the benchmarks that we have today. That 19% also, by the way, is what Moody's uses both at Missouri and Illinois relative to their existing rating.","So those are the thresholds that we've set. We've not articulated, I'd say exactly where we are relative to those, but as you can tell from the positive outlook at S&P and you know the fact that we've got a stable rating at Moody's should tell you something about where we sit relative to those metrics.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then just to understand a little bit more about the capital opportunity plan here, perhaps leaving behind Missouri, but focusing elsewhere, looks like transition spend in the MTAP [ph] looks up in the draft. Also curious on any thought process of any potential legislation in Illinois next year, how are you thinking about the various pieces that may or may not already be reflected in your existing capital plan aside the roughly $2 billion between wind and grid mod that you've already articulated here. I just want to make sure we're fully inclusive here of some of the other potential - factors.","Warner Baxter","Yes, sure, Julien. This is Warner. Look, I would say this, obviously we have a very robust five-year plan and we have identified in that plan the opportunity for an incremental $2 billion, one for grid mod and another for wind investment in Missouri. As I've said before, our plan isn't just a five-year plan, you know, our team is focused on creating an infrastructure pipeline to bring benefits for our customers for years six through 10 and then go out to 15. And so as we look at in Illinois, we believe that the MAP program was certainly a 10-year program, but I know Richard and his team continue to believe that they have robust distribution projects to continue to enhance service for our customers whether it's in substations, what it's to continue to automate the grid. Obviously the smart meter is done, but we continue to see opportunities there and in our gas business as well. We're investing more money in the gas business with that constructive framework. We believe there could be some new regulations coming down the pipe that will ultimately require additional investments there, but we believe too that there are opportunities.","You think about transmission, we obviously outlined the investments that we're making there both in multi-value and the liability projects. But you step back and you look at what's going on in MISO with all the renewable energy projects that are coming online, and a lot of interconnection agreements are being put in there, there could be an opportunity down the road to have more robust transmission planning and investments, I can't predict whether it will be another round of multi-valued projects but when you look at the level of renewable coming into that space, now that's something the step back and think about beyond the five-year horizon and so I would say that we feel very strong, we're not just focusing on folks years six through 15.","You made a passing comment about Illinois legislation, we're focused on executing the plan, this is not something that is top of our list of things to focus on in Illinois but of course we're always engaged in the framework and the policy discussions in Illinois just like we are in Missouri and at the Federal level. So hopefully that gives you a good insight in terms of how we think about the business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Good morning guys.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Insoo. How are you doing today?","Insoo Kim","Good, good. Just maybe focusing on the 2018 guidance raise this quarter at the $0.15 at the midpoint, I know part of that was due to better than normal weather for the quarter but are there what are what's making up some of the other items that contribute to the increase and is that more timing related or something more sustainable that could help in 2019 and beyond?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Insoo, this is Marty. The timing item we noted is really intra-year, I would say so, it's important to understand that year-to-date we have had a $0.12 benefit from the timing of income tax expense reductions versus income tax related revenue reductions associated with federal tax reform. So I think it's important to note that $0.12 benefit will reverse in the fourth quarter. So I want to say that will be earnings neutral for the year, back to your question though at the midpoint of our guidance, our core guidance which is $3.40 if you back out the benefit we have of weather year-to-date which is $0.27, the net of that is about $3.13 again a midpoint on the weather normalized basis which does compare favorably to the midpoint of the guidance we gave out at the beginning of the year at $3.05 about $0.08. And I think where you really see that is when you look at our slides and you look at the benefit that we've had year-to-date of sales, on a nine months to date basis versus the impact of weather what you find there is an incremental benefit from sales of about $0.05.","So I talked about some of the positive sales trends on our call in our prepared remarks. But those positive sales trends are helping this year and I'd say that's the bulk of the driver of the guidance range when you back out weather.","Insoo Kim","Got it. And do you what is your - do you provide a longer term low growth excluding EE type of growth rate?","Marty Lyons","What we typically talk about is including EE, I mean we're seeing today what we gave out a similar growth, we're seeing year-to-date, again in Illinois where we're seeing some growth which is positive, we're de-coupled there, so I'd focus on the Missouri growth, there we're seeing residential and commercial growth executing energy efficiency a little over 1% in industrial growth too a little over 1%.","So those are positive trends and as I remarked on our last call, I mean that's underpinned by some strong, I think economic data we're seeing, job growth we're seeing unemployment down in Missouri at about 3.7%, so below the national average and importantly we're seeing residential and commercial customer counts increasing in each of those more than half a percent in terms of incremental customer count.","So I think those are some positive trends, longer term we're still thinking that inclusive of the impacts of energy efficiency, we're going to expect to see about flattish growth and as we move through time and we assess the results giving thought to the positive economic signs we're seeing in weather there should be any change in our guidance longer term but like I said for now we're thinking that inclusive of the energy efficiency which is both the energy efficiency that we promote but also sort of just natural energy efficiency that's coming through national standards. Again, we're expecting about flattish over time.","Insoo Kim","Understand and maybe just one more question, on the dividend I know the payout of 55 to 70 target you guys are currently at the lower end of that given the potential upside to capital and rate base growth or you can see in the various jurisdictions which would be assumption be that the payout would remain sort of in the lower half of that range for the foreseeable future?","Warner Baxter","This is Warner. Yes, look I think big picture we targeted between 55% and 70% and so we're not saying whether going to be, where we're going to be in that picture but as I said earlier look I'm pleased that the board raise the dividend for the fifth consecutive year and I think it clearly reflects their confidence in terms of with our long term growth plan and so we continue to be very comfortable with expressing our dividend in terms of the payout range and that coupled with a very strong rate base growth plan we think is delivering very strong total show returns.","Insoo Kim","Understand, thank you very much.","Warner Baxter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Good morning, guys. A pretty thorough Q&A already so just a quick clean up on page eight of the handout. The potential wind generation investment in Missouri the $1 billion I think you lay out on another slide that those would be built on transfer projects that is that correct. If is deductable?","Warner Baxter","Yes, both transfer agreements. Greg, I'm sorry, this is Warner, that's correct.","Greg Gordon","They would impact earnings when acquired there would be no buildup of AFEDC or capitalized interest et cetera because they would you would simply transact upon close. A is that correct and B, what's your best guesstimate is when, I know there's probably a range of outcomes as to when they're delivered one would be a good place holder for our modeling assumptions.","Marty Lyons","Sure, Greg. This is martin. Yes, first you're correct. In terms of your assumption around AFEDC financing I'm in a characteristic of a build transfer agreement has that the developers will finance during construction and will take ownership when the projects are complete. And it's of that point that, we would have the financing costs and revenues associated with those projects, so you're absolutely right you're thinking of those, in terms of progress on the projects.","I mean we were pleased to on for example on the Terregen [ph] project the first 400 megawatts to be able to get a settlement with parties to that case and just recently here and get a certificate of convenience and need from the commission, in a five month timeframe so I think that's a good step forward and bodes well we believe for approvals in future projects. That's that, another hurdle we have to get through is to get through the MISO interconnection process and get those approvals and certificates to move forward. So ultimately, we believe that these projects will go into service in 2020. That is our goal because that's when the PTC maximum value is realized. And then when in 2020 it's hard to say Greg it will really depend on, how we get through some of these MISO interconnection process, how construction goes but ultimately the goal is to get these in service by the end of 2020.","Greg Gordon","Okay, so they may have a material impact on 2020 earnings but they'll definitely be fully loaded sort to speak in 2021.","Warner Baxter","Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Perfect. One follow-up on the rid mode vestment through 2023 the $1 billion when - is that going to be sort of a readable spend over a period of years, you expect that to be back end loaded, how should we think about that feathering in to plan.","Michael Moehn","Greg, it's Michael Moehn. Yes, I think, previously we've said that it's going to be fairly readable at this point, so I'm not going to part of the work right way to look at the beginning in 2019.","Greg Gordon","Beginning in 2019 right.","Michael Moehn","Okay, thank you guys very much. Have a great day.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning. Congratulations on the good results.","Warner Baxter","Thank you and appreciated. Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","So I just wanted to talk about the wind program that you have the 700 megawatts or the up to 700 megawatts if you did find that there were more opportunities that were beneficial to customers because when the economics continue to get better, could you remind us of just the regulatory process you would go through if you wanted to go back and suggest that, hey we should actually upsized this to above 700 megawatts, how would that sort of work out in the regulatory arena?","Warner Baxter","So Stephen, I'll kick it off. And then I'll turn it over to Michael to make sure we have the regulatory process nailed down. But look, the bottom-line, if we see opportunities in renewable generation in here, we are talking about when that are beneficial for customers, we will lean forward and move forward those projects.","Even when we announced this at the integrated resource plan at some time gosh, I guess it was last year. We said that they are not only interested to meet the renewable energy standard opportunities, but also opportunities to invest more in wind or solar, should the economics continue to come down, so we will look at that. And so, Michael, why don't you talk about the specific process? Should we choose to do that in the future, what that would look like?","Michael Moehn","Yes, I mean again, the 700 megawatts is obviously to comply with the renewable standard that's in the state. I mean, it would really take a very similar process honestly, if we identified other projects that for the benefit of our customers going through and applying for that CC and going through that stakeholder process going through and getting those interconnection agreements done all those things that we are doing as part of the 700 megawatts today.","Stephen Byrd","Understood, okay. So very much similar to how you approach it so far. And then, just I wanted to make sure I was thinking about the cap on customer builds, the 2.85% compound impact, given the benefits that you've had from tax reform and other dynamics but also factoring in the spending plans you have, how much additional headroom do you have over and above factoring in everything that you sort of announced today in terms of additional headroom over the over the period?","Marty Lyons","Yes, Stephen it's Marty. In terms of that, I'd say we wouldn't - haven't really talked about a headroom if you will. I know what we said is that we do feel very comfortable that the 2 billion of additional spending that we've been talking about which we've said numerous times, we think a bit largely additive to our capital expenditure plan that we can fully achieve that and stay under that cap with some margin, haven't specified what that margin is but I've talked a lot about and did earlier on this call, you know the various benefits that we see in terms of helping to keep rate growth low, part of it is the federal taxes, part of it's the delivered fuel we've talked about, part of it as the refinancing and part of it is the continued discipline around O&M, including benefits that we expect will come with some of the grid modernization investments we are making.","Stephen Byrd","Understood, that's all I have. Thank you.","Marty Lyons","All right. Thanks Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Marty Lyons","Hello, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Hey. How you are doing?","Marty Lyons","I'm right. How are you?","Paul Patterson","All right, so just I know you guys don't want to predict the ISO New England impact on the MISO complaint case. However, I'm sure you guys have been doing some number crunching on what the - what you guys sort of might. What if the proposed methodology that FERC is employing there were to be employed in life of this case, could you give us a little bit of a sense as to what you think it would come up with and in the base ROE complaint case?","Marty Lyons","Yes. Paul, your instincts were correct. I think what we think it's premature really to estimate the impact potential impact on the MISO complaints, look I'll say this, we do think it's positive that the FERC is taking steps to address the ROE uncertainty, we think that's positive. We also think that, the proposal that they've made is a step in the right direction, but we say it's premature, because as you well know, it's really a proposal requesting comments, if you will briefs from parties in the New England case and things could change over time. So, we think it's a positive step but there's still ways to go. Of course, in the first really under no timeline to rule here, they've got briefs that are due in mid-January. So we do think a, we do think that FERC will take action in 2019 and will stay closely posted and overtime I think as they work through the methodology, we will have to take a look at our cases, each case as you know has somewhat different facts and data, things are subject to interpretation. So, we will be will be assessing all of that, but we think as we sit here today, it's really, premature to comment on your specific question.","Paul Patterson","Okay, fair enough. And then on the - can you just remind in terms of the current growth rate that you guys have what the forecast for the 30-year Treasury is in terms of that?","Marty Lyons","Yes. In terms of the guidance we've given today and I think what once you are talking about as our current guidance of 5% to 7% compound EPS growth out through 2022 and really that accommodates a range of interest rates and ROEs as well as other things like capital spending levels, rate case outcomes, economic conditions but specifically on your question we said over time that really accommodates a range of Treasury rates and ROE levels. There's not a specific.","Paul Patterson","You are not using that blue-chip thing as you guys were using before?","Marty Lyons","No, you have a good long memory though going back probably, five years ago or so, I - we did use that as a - an anchor on our guidance, but now we've gotten away from that over time.","Paul Patterson","Okay, and then just finely on the one-time impact at $0.05, what caused the tax evaluation to happen this quarter I guess, you followed what I'm saying we are going to TCGA?","Marty Lyons","Yes, I do. Paul, when they put out their rules last year, they - everybody made their best assessment with respect to certain transition provisions that we had to make a good sales estimate. But understanding that as rules and regulations were clarified that there would be some updates. In this particular case, the primary driver was that, we got some guidance from IRS with respect to how to provide or how to deal with the transition of bonus depreciation as related to 2017. So we receive that guidance and as we filed our tax return here in the third quarter for 2017, that caused this then to go ahead and true up the revaluation that we did at the end of last year. So that's in a nutshell what happened.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Marty Lyons","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Warner Baxter","Hello, Anthony.","Anthony Crowdell","Good morning. I think, I maybe just beating a dead horse here. I just wanted to go through a quick housekeeping. The end of the second quarter guidance was 315 to 335. You've raised the midpoint now, I believe $0.15. But whether you are saying a $0.06 is the remainder, $0.09 the timing of the tax item?","Warner Baxter","No, it's not. Now the tax item is really excluded. So, if you look at, in particular if you look at slide 12 that we gave out, we talked about what the gap EPS raise was and then the core EPS, so when you look at the core EPS range of $3.35 cents to $3.45 that excludes the impact of that $0.05. So the midpoint there of the $3.35 to $3.45 sense is of course $3.40 cents. If you compare that back to the beginning of your midpoint, the beginning of the year midpoint was $3.05. So you can see the Delta then of that 27 senses whether. Okay, so if you back out whether from the 340, you get to $3.13 and that is indeed about $0.08 higher than the midpoint of our beginning of your guidance and so the big driver of that when you look through the slides and you'll have a chance to look through the detail is that we have seen sales growth that is contributing more than the $0.27 of whether and in fact - if you do the math that sales growth is about $0.05.","So when you think about what, why is the guidance going up, part of it is weather or a large part of this weather. That is also about $0.08 of other stuff. And the primary driver that is incremental sales not associated with weather, which is we estimate to be about $0.05.","Anthony Crowdell","So I'll follow that, but I'm - I can't do the same for what happened after the second quarter to the fourth quarter just going by the - because you seem to keep pointing back to the original core EPS, can I do the same with what you updated at the second quarter till now?","Warner Baxter","Yes, you can. And the answer will be the same. That it's really sales growth over the course of the year that's allowing us to - amongst other things to raise the guidance but you can absolutely do the same thing rolling forward from the guidance we had last quarter.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Warner Baxter","You are absolutely welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","Hi, good morning.","Warner Baxter","Good morning Ashar. How are you?","Ashar Khan","Pretty good. Just going on the 2019 consideration slide, this year you were banking off O&M to be higher, if my memory is correct, by about $0.14. Can we assume that the accruement could be of a similar amount next year? Could you provide a little bit - kind of a little bit with same, less or more, I'm just trying to get a better sense to cause that factor as we look into next year?","Warner Baxter","No. Ashar, you are absolutely right. We had suggested at the beginning of the year that the O&M would be up about $0.14 year-over-year, excluding Callaway. And if you look through the year-to-date considerations and you look at our guidance for the balance of the year, I think would you would find this would be about $0.16 up year-over-year, but we do not expect that all of that would be raised next year. We do as suggest on the slide, the slide you point to, slide 16; we do expect O&M non-Callaway related O&M in this area to be down next year, but not that entire $0.16. So, yes, expect it to be down to some extent, but not the full amount.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Say more than $0.10 or so\u2026","Warner Baxter","Ashar, I appreciate your desire to pin me down on that, but I would say just at this point we expect it to be down some. As you might imagine, we are still looking to finalize our plans for '19. Those are not set in stone, but we do have clarity that we do expect the number to be down.","Ashar Khan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kirk for any closing remarks.","Andrew Kirk","Thank you for participating in the call. A replay of this call will be available for one year on our Web site. If you have questions, you may call the contact listed on our earnings release.

Marty will follow with a more detailed discussion of third quarter 2013 financial results, other financial matters and pending rate cases. We will then open the call for questions.","Before Tom begins, I would like to mention that all per share amounts discussed during today's presentation are presented on a diluted share basis.","Now here's Tom, who will start on Page 3 of the presentation.","Thomas R. Voss","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2013 of $1.25 per share. This compares with $1.28 per share for the third quarter of 2012. The reduction in earnings from continuing operations was primarily the result of lower electric sales volumes, reflecting temperatures that were much cooler than those of the prior year period.","The impact of milder weather was partially offset by a rate increase from Missouri Electric Service effective in January of this year, higher Illinois electric delivery earnings recognized under formula ratemaking and disciplined cost management. While Marty will provide details on our earnings in a few minutes, the bottom line is that we had a solid quarter from an operations and earnings perspective.","Moving now to Page 4. Today, we also updated our earnings guidance. We now expect 2013 earnings from continuing operations to be in a range of $2 to $2.10 per share compared to the prior range of $2 to $2.15 per share. This update incorporates the negative impact of cooler-than-normal weather in the third quarter. Guidance continues to include approximately $0.20 per share of parent and other costs, including certain costs that were previously allocated to the merchant generation business. However, we expect to reduce these costs to $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2014 and to reduce some further in 2015 as we refinance parent company debt and rationalize operating costs.","Turning now to Page 5. I would like to briefly review our strategy for achieving financial success and appraise you of progress in a few key areas. This page outlines some of our key strategic objectives.","Our first objective is to reduce our business risk by completing the divestiture of our merchant generation business. The resulting shift to a fully rate-regulated business is expected to substantially improve the predictability of future earnings and cash flows. In a few moments, I will update you on our divestiture efforts.","A key second strategic objective is to invest in and operate our businesses in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We do this because healthy financial performance is critical to our shareholders, just as it is to our ability to undertake the significant operating and capital spending needed to meet customers' energy needs and expectations.","To meet this objective, we have been requesting and obtaining rate increases as needed, as well as aligning operating and capital spending consistent with regulatory outcomes and existing frameworks. As a result of these and other operational and cost containment initiatives, our electric rates have remained low, delivery service system reliability has been enhanced, energy center availability has remained strong and earning returns at our utilities have improved.","To be positioned to invest so that we could meet our future energy needs and expectations, we have also been aggressively working to enhance regulatory frameworks, which is our third strategic objective listed here. Modern, constructive regulatory frameworks, such as those we have in place for our FERC-regulated transmissions and Illinois-regulated energy delivery businesses support investment in utility infrastructure, benefiting our utilities and the communities we serve.","The final strategic objective I will mention is that of developing additional rate-regulated opportunities for investment and growing rate base. Over the last few years, we have identified in advance several new attractive opportunities, including our Modernization Action Plan, which is accelerating improvements to Ameren Illinois' electric and natural gas delivery systems and new FERC-regulated transmission projects designed to improve reliability and efficiency.","We expect successful execution of our strategies to result in meeting our customers' future energy needs and expectations, earning fair returns on our investments and earnings and dividend growth, driven by projected rate base growth of approximately 7% annually through 2017.","Moving to Page 6. I would like to update you on our progress toward achieving the first strategic objective I mentioned, exiting our merchant generation business. After many months of tremendous work by people across our organization and close coordination with Dynegy, this exit is nearing completion. We expect to close the divestiture of our Ameren Energy Resources merchant generation business to Dynegy affiliate, Illinois Power Holdings, by the end of this year. This transaction received approval from the FERC in October.","The divestiture agreement requires that Illinois Power Holdings receive a variance to the Illinois multi-pollutant standard from the State Pollution Control Board with the same material conditions as the variance issued to our merchant generation business just last year. Certain Ameren subsidiaries in Illinois Power Holdings filed a variance request in July of this year. The Pollution Control Board is expected to issue its decision by the 21st of this month, and we continue to expect a positive outcome.","In addition, our efforts to sell the 3 merchant gas-fired energy centers we retained with the exercise of the Genco put option are nearing a successful conclusion. In October, we announced an agreement to sell the 3 energy centers to an affiliate of Rockland Capital. The expected sale proceeds are more than sufficient to ensure that the sale does not negatively impact Ameren's earnings or cash flows. Genco has received $137.5 million for the assets and is expected to receive up to an additional $15 million of after-tax net proceeds from the sale 2 years following the close of this transaction. The sale of the 3 plants is expected to close by year end, subject to FERC approval.","Turning now to Page 7 of our presentation and shifting to transmission. I would like to update you on the approximately $1.1 billion Illinois Rivers project. This MISO-approved multi-value project is nearly 400 miles long and it consists of a high-voltage transmission line running west to east across the State of Illinois.","In August, the Illinois Commerce Commission or ICC approved the need for the Illinois Rivers project and granted key portions of the project a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The ICC indicated that it did not approve certain line segments and substations due to a lack of time and evidence to determine the most cost-effective segment routes and substation locations.","We and certain other parties filed with the ICC requesting a rehearing. In October, the ICC granted a rehearing to determine the routing of 4 of the 9 mine segments, including 2 granted a certificate in the initial order, and the location of 6 of the 9 substations. We do not expect this rehearing process to delay the project or significantly change our investment plans.","The ICC is expected to issue an order on rehearing by March of next year, and we expect a certificate to be granted for the remainder of the project. Meanwhile, we've begun to acquire rights of way for those portions of the project that are not subject to rehearing. The Illinois Rivers project and in fact, all of our Illinois transmission business operates under FERC, constructive, forward-looking or formula ratemaking framework. This ratemaking provides an opportunity for us to earn fair returns on our investments and recover our costs on a timely basis.","I will now turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Lyons","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 8 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2013 net income, combining results from both continuing and discontinued operations of $1.24 per share compared to third quarter 2012 net income of $1.54 per share. As Tom previously mentioned, our third quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations were $1.25 per share, compared to $1.28 per share for the prior year period.","On Page 9, we outlined key drivers of the variance between earnings for the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of last year. The earnings comparison was negatively impacted by lower electric sales volumes due to temperatures that were much cooler than those of the prior year period. These cooler summer temperatures reduced 2013 third quarter earnings by an estimated $0.15 per share compared to the third quarter of 2012 and by an estimated $0.03 per share compared to normal temperatures.","Last year, third quarter temperatures were very warm, with cooling degree days 21% higher than normal. This year, third quarter temperatures were milder, with cooling degree days 5% lower than normal. The quarter-over-quarter temperature-related earnings variance was offset by several positive factors, including increased rates from Missouri Electric Service effective in January of 2013. That rate adjustment favorably impacted third quarter 2013 earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the prior year period. Results were also favorably impacted by higher Illinois electric delivery earnings, benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the prior year period.","These higher earnings reflect the timing differences among each year's quarters, increased rate base and higher allowed return on equity recognized under formula ratemaking, reflecting higher 30-year treasury bond yields. Several other factors resulted in a negative $0.04 per share net impact on the earnings comparison.","Moving to Page 10. I would like to provide information to assist you in thinking about earnings for the balance of the year. As a starting point, fourth quarter 2012 earnings from continuing operations were $0.04 per share. On this page, we have listed select items that are expected to impact fourth quarter 2013 earnings compared to the prior year period.","The first item I would like to mention is weather. Weather had little net impact on earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus normal conditions. And of course, our earnings guidance assumes normal conditions for the fourth quarter of this year.","Second, we estimate that Illinois electric delivery earnings recognized under formula ratemaking will increase fourth quarter 2013 earnings by approximately $0.03 per share compared to the prior year period. This increase is expected to result from timing differences among each year's quarters, increased rate base and a higher allowed return on equity, reflecting higher 30-year treasury yields. This is a good place to note that our full year 2013 earnings guidance now incorporates an average 30-year treasury bond yield of 3.44% and therefore, a formula allowed return on equity of 9.24%.","Third, the earnings comparison is expected to benefit by approximately $0.06 per share from increased Missouri electric and Illinois transmission service rates, both effective in January of this year. Finally, we expect results to reflect continued disciplined cost management.","Turning then to Page 11. We move from earnings to a discussion of our updated 2013 free cash flow guidance. We calculate free cash flow by starting with our net cash provided by operating activities and subtracting from it our capital expenditures, other cash flows from investing activities and dividends.","For 2013, we continued to anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $450 million. The guidance continues to include merchant divestiture-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, including the $25 million of cash that is currently on Genco's balance sheet. These divestiture-related cash outflows are more than offset by expected transaction-related cash tax benefits with a present value of approximately $180 million, which we expect to substantially realize in 2015.","Moving now to Page 12. I would like to update you on Ameren Illinois' 2 pending Illinois energy delivery rate cases. In our gas delivery rate case, we have requested a $47 million annual increase based on a 2014 future test year. The ICC staff has recommended a rate increase of $27 million or $20 million less than our request, with a primary difference related to the return on equity level that should be incorporated into rates.","The Illinois industrial energy customers has also filed a return on equity testimony in the case, supporting the level that falls between the ICC staff's position and our request. In addition, the Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board recommended that the ICC use a higher forecast of revenues from gas transportation, a lower forecast of employee headcount and various other adjustments. However, they did not file return on equity testimony.","In total, the Attorney General, Citizens Utility Board adjustments would reduce the rate increase amount by approximately $11 million compared to our request. The ALJ's recommendation is expected as soon as today or tomorrow. A final ICC decision is due no later than December 19 of this year, with new rates expected to be effective late this year.","Turning to Page 13. In addition to the pending gas rate case, in April of this year, we made a required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Our filing supports a net actual rate decrease, reflecting the decrease for the 2012 revenue reconciliation under formula ratemaking, partially offset by an increase to reflect 2012 recoverable cost and expected 2013 net plant additions as prescribed by the rate formula. The ICC staff is recommending a larger net rate decrease. The ICC ALJs are expected to issue their recommended order soon and the final ICC decision is due no later than December 15 of this year. New rates are scheduled to take effect in January of next year.","I would note that the midpoint of our 2013 earnings guidance reflects an outcome to this electric delivery case, with cost of service adjustments that are similar to those made by the ICC in our 2012 rate orders.","Moving to Page 14 of our presentation. We plan to provide 2014 earnings guidance and comment on our multi-year earnings outlook when we release fourth quarter 2013 earnings in February. But here, we list some key items to consider as you think about next year.","Ameren Missouri will remain focused on enhancing its regulatory framework. At this time, we continue to have discussions with numerous stakeholders in an effort to develop a specific legislative proposal. Our focus is on enhancements that will reduce regulatory lag, allowing us to increase discretionary investments in our aging Missouri infrastructure, advancing our ability to meet the energy needs and expectations of our customers and create jobs.","While the exact timing has not yet been determined and assuming no change in the regulatory framework, we expect to file electric service rate case in Missouri in the second half of 2014, with new rates expected to be effective in 2015. Key drivers of this filing include the need to reflect in rates the approximately $320 million to $370 million investment we are making in a new reactor head for the Callaway Energy Center and enhanced pollution control equipment, electrostatic precipitator upgrades at the Labadie Energy Center.","The reactor head replacement, a project which has been successfully completed at many U.S. nuclear generating plants, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2014 when the plant will be shut down for a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. The Labadie precipitator upgrades are also expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of next year.","Before I leave the discussion to Missouri, I want to mention that 2014 earnings comparisons will benefit from the absence of a 2013 charge of $0.07 per share related to the fuel adjustment clause and presumed a normal weather conditions versus mild year-to-date weather in 2013, which is estimated to have negatively impacted earnings by about $0.02 per share.","For Ameren Illinois electric delivery service, 2014 will be another year of performance-based formula ratemaking, with the allowed return on equity tied to 30-year treasury yields. For gas delivery service, 2014 will be a year with new rates in effect, rates that will be established based on a 2014 future test year. Further, our gas delivery service plans to participate in Illinois' infrastructure surcharge framework beginning next year.","This legislatively enabled framework allows rates to be adjusted monthly between rate cases to reflect investments in qualified gas delivery infrastructure. As a result of these constructive regulatory frameworks, we plan to continue our investment in the electric and gas delivery service enhancements under our Illinois Modernization Action Plan.","At our FERC-regulated transmission business, next year is expected to be one of continued investment, a reliability project in Ameren Illinois and advancement of the previously discussed Illinois Rivers project. Finally, as Tom discussed, we expect parent and other expenses to decline in 2014 compared to 2013, and we plan to continue disciplined cost management across the company.","Turning to the final page of our presentation, Number 15, I will summarize. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations were solid. We are on target to become a fully rate-regulated utility with our exit from the merchant generation business expected to be completed by year end. Our regulatory frameworks have improved, and we are working to further enhance them, especially in Missouri. We have a well-defined investment plan that is aligned with our regulatory frameworks. And importantly, these investments are needed to meet our customers' energy needs and expectations.","This investment plan is expected to lead to rate base growth of approximately 7% annually over the 2013 to 2017 period, a growth rate above the average for regulated peers. And we look for this rate base growth to result in earnings and dividend growth. In addition, as mentioned, we expect the earnings drag of parent company and other costs to decline from the expected 2013 level, providing an additional benefit to earnings in 2014 and 2015 beyond that of rate base growth.","Finally, Ameren's $1.60 per share annualized dividend rate provides investors with the yield of approximately 4.4%.","That concludes my prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just weather-normalized sales growth. I was wondering if you could tell us where you are year-to-date. I remember you guys are being sort of flattish with your expectations. Just sort of if there's any update in not just the actuals but just the outlook for -- going forward longer term.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Sure, Paul. As it relates to the sales growth, I think as we came into this year, we talked about, I think, 0 to maybe even 0.5%, however, of growth as it related to residential and commercial sales. And as we sit here today, I'd say we're seeing sort of different conditions in Missouri and Illinois. We're actually seeing that nearly 0.5% sales growth in residential and commercial sales in Missouri despite, I would say, some spending that -- we've increased spending we've had this year in terms of energy efficiency. And we've also seen industrial sales growth in Missouri this year of about 0.7%. So overall, we're pleased, I'd say, with that level of growth. As I said, we are spending quite a bit on energy efficiency, which, I think longer term, will keep that sales growth more muted and down in that 0 to 0.5% range. Some positives, I'd say, we're seeing in Missouri. We have seen, this year, growth in jobs in both services jobs, as well as goods-producing kind of jobs, manufacturing jobs. And I think that's some of what's coming through in terms of improved sales. So we do expect continued moderate growth, but offset by continuing conservation and energy efficiency mitigating some of that sales growth. But year-to-date, happy with that. In Illinois, it's not been -- not quite as positive. We've seen that residential and commercial sales, actually flat to down, about 0.5%, with commercial, in fact, being down a little more than residential. In industrial sales, as we've talked about on prior calls, down about 6.6% this year. And that does reflect, I'd say, some of the conditions we've been seeing in Illinois. We have seen -- in terms of jobs, we have seen goods-producing jobs down, though I would say services jobs have been up in Illinois. But the conditions just don't seem to be as good with some of the industrial sales down. We've seen declines at places like Caterpillar and heavy equipment and some of the metals areas, steel, U.S. Steel, things like that. One important thing to remember though, Paul, about Illinois is that we do have the formula rates there, and there is a -- we got a formulaic ROE, but there's also a collar around that, plus or minus 50 basis points, which means that, at the end of the day, sales fluctuations, positive or negative, are bound by that, so at most, I'd say a $0.025 positive or negative from any kind of sales fluctuations, whether they be weather related or load related.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to that. The ambitious rate growth, just how do we think about customer builds? You mentioned energy efficiency, that's going to offset obviously some of the impact. Some of the things you're doing are probably going to increase operational efficiencies. So you can't just look at that as a flat impact. But just in general, how should we think about how customers' bills will be impacted by this rate base growth, given the low sales growth, but of course, factoring in these operational and energy efficiency things that are going to be counteracting rate base growth, rate impacts, if you follow me?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. I'll talk a little bit where -- about our -- where our rate base growth is. As you know, a lot of our rate base growth is really in transmission and we're also investing in the Modernization Action Plan in Illinois, as I discussed. And with respect to transmission, of course, the centerpiece of our investment is really in MISO multi-value projects where the benefit of those projects is region-wide, and therefore, the costs associated with those are spread region-wide and don't necessarily then impact our Illinois customer rates, but more rates and cost regionally, so those get spread. As it relates to the Modernization Action Plan, some of the investments we're making at Illinois, the Illinois -- bills of customers are being impacted at the same time as they are by the rollout of these investments, but also by following power prices that have taken place in MISO and have also been impacting customers' bills. So one of the things we're focused on as it relates to those Illinois bills is really working to keep rates, annual rate increases below, say, a 2.5% level and that's the focus there. And then in Missouri, you're right, energy efficiency is -- we're rolling out meaningful energy efficiency programs. I think it's a well-constructed program for Ameren Missouri and for the state, where certainly we're kept whole, if you will, for the energy efficiency efforts, but customers have the opportunity to benefit from those. And then we're also continuing, as we talked about on the call -- focused on disciplined cost control. And we're focused on lean efforts, really, across our Missouri operations and across the company to try to keep any rate increases minimized.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just thinking about the Missouri rate case you plan to file, does this imply you're expecting to underearn by a good bit in the Missouri in 2014? Is there a kind of -- how should we quantify the amount of lag that's happening in Missouri right now?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, as you know, Michael -- thanks again for joining us, by the way, and then -- and your comments at the outset. As it relates to the Missouri rate case, it's -- the filing of that rate case next year isn't solely a commentary on earned returns, but certainly, it's being driven by the things we talked about, making meaningful investments in the reactor head replacement, as well as in environmental controls for the Labadie plant. And clearly, under Missouri's current framework, which does use historical cost, what we need to do is we think about meaningful investments that will grow the rate base and being able to earn a fair return on those investments. We'll need to make a rate case filing at a timely way to make sure we recover those costs and again, position ourselves to earn fair returns. Those are really the drivers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then the bulk of the $320 million to $370 million for Callaway and Labadie, is that cost you'll incur in '14? So when you think about Union Electric kind of CapEx of directionally $500 million to $600 million, that this makes up a large portion of it?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, it is a large portion there. Some of those costs -- you don't start those project necessarily in '14, so we've been certainly spending some, say, towards that reactor head already. But yes, I mean, they'll hit largely in '14 and again, be in service by the end of '14.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, in the quarter or maybe more importantly, year-to-date for 2013, what was the earnings contribution for the FERC-regulated transmission?","Martin J. Lyons","Michael, I'll see if Doug can dig that out. I don't have that here in front of me and don't know it off the top of my head.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Or kind of think about what's just embedded in 2013 guidance for it.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, I think Doug's going to take a look through it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Paul Zimbardo from UBS.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Paul from Julien's team here. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the impacts of the closing of the Paducah processing plant. How do you see this impacting the outlook for Joppa, as well as our prices and demand in the region and also the -- if you could mention the impacts to your financials.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. Paul, this is Marty. As it relates to the Paducah facility and impact on Joppa, obviously, the Joppa facility is one that -- is part of the portfolio that we're looking to sell to Dynegy. In terms of the impacts of the Paducah facility closing on our earnings, I don't really have anything to report there. Overall, that -- the merchant business, this quarter versus last, performed well. Availability was solid. Capacity factors were solid at the plants. I think, as we all know, power prices were down a little bit, down some this year versus last. But we came into the year pretty well hedged. So overall, the unit continues to perform well. I can't really comment on how that facility closing would impact future years and certainly expect that, that plant to be part of the Dynegy IPH portfolio going forward.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up. I believe you said you were assuming a 3.44% average for the treasury yields. Could you quantify what the impact was for the third quarter and roughly the amount that was implied in that fourth quarter guidance?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, the amount that's implied in the fourth quarter guidance, Paul, really is within that 9.24%. So when we talk about the 9.24%, it's really what we're expecting to be the average over the course of -- over 2013. And as then we look at the blue chip consensus for next year, we see that going up to maybe 3.95% for the 30-year treasuries, which would put you at about 9.75%. In terms of the impact on the ROE, you can kind of do the math. What we've talked about is about 50 basis points is roughly $0.025, so depending upon what's your expectation, as you can kind of take a look at what the impact is.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You -- in your prepared remarks, you had talked about just growing the dividend. I was hoping you can walk us through the policy and your expectations going forward there, and then a follow-up.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, sure. So there -- as we've discussed in the past, what the board looks at is a number of factors. But first of all, getting this deal closed with the sale of the merchant business, which, as we've talked about, we expect the benefit of that to be more stability and certainty in terms of earnings and cash flows going forward. So that's an important step. And then, looking at growth in the earnings and cash flows of the regulated businesses going forward, we've talked about a payout range target to be in the range of 55% to 70% of our regulated earnings. And today, we're at the upper end of that range with our $1.60 earnings. But as we do grow the earnings from the regulated business, and we believe we have a good plan to do so, and as we grow those earnings and cash flows, aspire to be able to then grow the dividend, and as that payout comes down into that range of 55% to 70% that I discussed.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Are you expecting not to raise the dividend until you get to around the midpoint?","Martin J. Lyons","No, that was not my statement at all.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up question. I think you noted that earnings for this year at the Illinois utilities don't reflect the SB 9 impact. Is that accurate?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, what the earnings reflect -- I guess, I'm trying -- not following in terms of what you mean by it doesn't reflect.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, I guess there are some benefits around the changes with the legislation earlier this year, and trying to figure out if that's incorporated in your earnings for this year of if that's more of a next year event, just given timing.","Martin J. Lyons","No, I think that the -- to the extent that the legislature clarified its views on the way the Illinois formula [indiscernible] we've actually formulated that into our 2013 earnings expectations. So it's our expectation that the Illinois Commerce Commission, as they rule on 2013 reconciliation, will, I guess, rule in line with the legislature's intent and financing this last piece of legislation. So that is reflected in our 2013 earnings. We haven't done anything in terms of going back in time and picking up any kind of benefit for prior years that may come through appeals of the commission's rulings for prior years. But we did impact -- we did update 2013 earnings for -- to reflect the provisions of that legislation.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of just regulatory lag in Illinois, can you just talk about where you expect that to be going forward or if there shouldn't be any lag with the changes made?","Martin J. Lyons","No, really shouldn't be any lag. When you think about the formulaic rates going forward, there really shouldn't be any lag. The legislation, we believe, is pretty prescriptive in terms of the costs that are picked up. Earlier this year, we did lay out certain costs that were outside of the formulaic ratemaking that would continue to be a drag, but for continuing efforts to reduce those costs, and we laid some of those costs out and we also identified those ones which we expected to go away over time. And then as it relates to the gas portion of the Illinois business, we have filed a rate case as we discussed on the call with the 2014 forward test year. And that forward test year is intended to minimize lag and some underearnings that we're experiencing this year in the gas business. But with the updated rates reflecting the 2014 cost and investments, that will minimize the lag next year. And then we also have the ability, now with the legislation in the gas portion of the business, to update rates monthly for incremental investments in our infrastructure that are beyond those reflected in the forward test year. So that also will help going forward as we deploy capital in the gas portion of the business to make sure we have an opportunity to earn a fair return there. Then the other portion of the Illinois business is -- continues to be transmission, where we still have transmission, that's FERC-regulated transmission in the Ameren Illinois business and of course, we have formula rates there. And again, don't experience lag as it relates to the transmission business. So all in all, I would say, in Illinois, very little in terms of ongoing regulatory lag.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ashar Khan from Visium.","Ashar Khan","If I can just go over these factors that you pointed out, Marty. So if I take the midpoint of the guidance for this year, which is I guess now $2.05, you kind of mentioned there is like $0.07 that doesn't come in because of the [indiscernible] more normal, so a more normalized number would be like $2.15, if I add those $0.10 back. And then you were saying that the parent and other should go from a negative $0.20 to somewhere between $0.10 and $0.15. So say, now you pick up on the $0.07 midpoint of that, so you're starting like at $2.22 normalized. And on top of that, we should add rate base growth for the distribution and transmission business. Am I doing my math right?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, all of your math is correct. So those are pieces of information provided. So then the midpoint is, as you pointed out, is $2.05, and our range is $2 to $2.10. I'd say, as we sit here today, we feel good about being maybe even a couple of cents into the top half of that range. So your $2.05 is a good starting point and you're right, we've had $0.07 of negative impact this year, one time from the FAC. And weather, one number -- you mentioned $0.03 weather. I think, year-to-date, it's probably $0.02 of negative weather, so it's -- you're probably talking about $0.09 there to add back, which you did appropriately. And you're absolutely right, we expect to reduce those parent company, other costs, which we estimate to be about $0.20 for this year, down to that range of $0.10 to $0.15 next year. So the things you're adding back are correct.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Martin J. Lyons","Operator, I think Paul was already on and off.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No, I'm here. I'm sorry. Just -- there was this an independent market monitor report from MISO that companies have been talking about in terms of potential impact on reliability and the reserve margin decrease. And rather -- I guess, under certain circumstances, rather sort of dramatic decrease, perhaps in reserve margin that has been discussed. And I was just thinking how you guys see that. I'm sure you guys have reviewed it. Obviously, for Illinois, the impact is a little bit different since you don't have generation. But just sort of how you see that in terms of Missouri and just any thoughts you have on that, and how that may or may not be in your rate base growth forecast right now, if you follow me, in terms of potential resolution of that or if you -- I don't know. Any comments you have on that I would be interested in.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Paul, I think as it relates to the issue you're referring to, we've had a long-standing position. We do believe that within MISO, we do need to get beyond this sort of annual capacity construct that really more of -- multi-year, longer-term price signals are appropriate to incentivize investment and make sure that we do have good reserve margins within MISO. It really comes down to being important, we believe, from a reliability standpoint. So our positions on those factors haven't changed over time. In terms of our Missouri operations, we obviously operate a good strong portfolio of assets that are performing well. And as we think -- longer term, as you've seen in our 5-year investment plans right now, I don't have anything in there in terms of meaningful change in our generation mix. But as we think longer term, we certainly do have an aging fleet of generating units, and we'll monitor all conditions, capacity price conditions, and as well as the IRP process in Missouri, which as we have discussed before, I think it's late next year. We will file another IRP with the Missouri Public Service Commission and at that time, I think we'll lay out our thinking about the options we have around our portfolio long term.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean, I guess, just wanted just a more general comment in terms of this potential -- rather remarkable reserve margin potential that, under certain circumstances, could theoretically show up. Obviously, you guys are -- feel reliability is important. It's not clear to me exactly where -- what service territory would be impacted or who would be deficient. But I'm just sort of wondering if there's any -- if you feel that there's any issue that requires sort of a more rapid response.","Martin J. Lyons","Well, we don't. As it relates to Missouri, which, I guess, for your question, we don't see a deficiency in our Missouri resources. I mean, we do have adequate resources in our Missouri business to meet our Missouri load obligations. So we don't see anything there. I think the -- one of the things we said, Paul, honestly, is that, with the reserve margins today, we believe, are high within MISO. At what point we get to sort of critical conditions is uncertain. We've certainly looked at what's been put forward by the market monitor and the committees that have reported out to MISO. And certainly, those are valid concerns that are being raised. And so we do think it's important that MISO take action to -- with regard to its capacity construct and move, as I've said earlier, into having a multi-year capacity construct. But as it relates to Missouri, I certainly don't see any kind of condition of emergency or urgency as it relates to our resources there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. What about Illinois? I mean, I know that you're not responsible for, but just in general, do you see that as a -- that Zone 4 is being problematic? And I guess, does that maybe lead to maybe additional transmission issues or potential investments or just any thoughts there?","Martin J. Lyons","Well, we're obviously -- we're investing a lot in transmission. I don't know if it will lead to incremental transmission in the near term. But our concerns about the capacity market and the -- our continued belief that it's important, from a reliability standpoint, to have a multi-year capacity construct, does get to Illinois and making sure that in Illinois, where it is a deregulated market, that the right price signals are sent over time to incentivize investment in generation so that there are resources available as Illinois goes out to -- and customers in Illinois go out to procure the power and capacity that they need. So again, I'm -- Paul, I'm not, by any means, saying that there's an emergency situation necessarily. But I think the points that are being raised at MISO are the right points to debate and consider as we think about a capacity construct going forward and the need for reliability in Illinois and throughout MISO.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Bill Appicelli from Nexus Asset Management.","Bill Appicelli","Just had a question about the underlying O&M growth that you've seen sort of for this year. I know there are some lumpy items, but what do you guys see sort of going forward at the utilities in terms of maybe O&M growth rate or -- you've got this comment about continued discipline on cost management. So is there a target in mind, or what are your thoughts around that?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. We haven't really -- Bill, thanks for the question. We haven't really communicated, I'd say, a target. Our goal is, as we've said repeatedly, is to, in Missouri, for example, is to keep our earned returns very close, as close as we can, to our allowed returns and to really try to minimize that impacts of regulatory lag. And so as I said earlier, we continue to look for ways to streamline our operations to become more efficient. I mentioned our lean efforts, which, we believe, over time, will produce savings but really haven't communicated, I'd say, any specific targets or expectations. In Illinois, we continue to be focused on running efficient, lean operations there as well. Earlier, the question came up about customer bills, and we are investing and improving the infrastructure in Illinois for the benefit of our customers, it's creating jobs as well. But one of the things we are doing is continuing to work to be efficient in terms of our operations and maintenance spending as we roll out those investments to, again, minimize the overall impact on our customers' bills. So really, across the operations, we're looking to operate in a very disciplined way.","Bill Appicelli","Okay. And then I guess, just at the parent, I know outside of the refinancing of the parent debt next year, that will drive some of the cost savings. What are the other areas that are -- you guys are focused on to reduce the parent drag?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. So there were -- I talked earlier in the year about as much as $30 million or so of costs that were G&A costs, if you will, that had been allocated over time to the merchant business. A significant amount of those are really direct costs, costs that we were incurring sort of at a parent level that were directly associated with the merchant businesses. So as we get to closure there, those costs -- those direct support costs will be eliminated. And then to the extent that there were other costs that were being allocated, we've had significant efforts underway over the past several months to identify ways to be able to eliminate those costs as well. And that progress -- that work has been going very smoothly and very well. So those targets that we talked about, getting $0.20 down to $0.10 to $0.15 next year, we feel very good about. And then as we look to '15, what we talked about on this call is getting those costs down even lower as those costs are reduced and rationalized. We get the full year benefit of the refinancing next year. And I've said before that we expect that we might be able to get those -- we'd be able to get those costs, not might -- we'd be able to get those costs down under $0.10 in the 2015 timeframe.","Bill Appicelli","Okay. And then just on the refinancing, do you expect to refinance the full $425 million or would there potentially be a lesser amount that's refinanced or -- in terms of reducing the principal?","Martin J. Lyons","That's under consideration. We think that today, if you look at today's market, that you'll be able to refinance that 8.875% debt. Today, maybe at around the 2.5% kind of mark. So favorable conditions as we sit here today and big opportunity for interest savings. What amount of that we would do sort of on a longer-term versus a short-term refinancing is under consideration and we'll let you know when we've got a specific view on that. But we do have -- as you know, we have the full capacity under our credit facilities available to us today. We've got no borrowings under those. So we have the flexibility with respect to that $425 million to do some of that long term and some of that on a short-term basis as well.","Operator","Our final question today will be a follow-up from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two items, one on O&M. Can you just walk us through how the Callaway outage schedules impact O&M? I think impacted last year and then will -- this year and then what the impact is in 2014? Does that get capitalized or is that all kind of flowing through and therefore, you see kind of some abnormal trends rather than just steady year-over-year changes in O&M?","Martin J. Lyons","Yes, Michael, that's true. I know that the accounting practices vary across the industry. But we do expense the full cost of the operations and maintenance expenses for the Callaway refueling in the period that, that outage occurs. So we had the full Callaway refuel expenses expensed earlier this year. So we did have a refueling in the spring of this year. The next one is, I sort of referred to earlier on the call, is in the fall of 2014. We certainly have significant capital expenditures at that time that I mentioned. We also have the refueling and maintenance outage, O&M costs that we will incur there at the end of 2014. And then 2015, we have no scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. So 2015 wouldn't have any refueling and maintenance outage costs in it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So will the -- because it's a bigger or kind of more complex outage that's happening in the fall of 2014, because you're doing the extensive capital work, will the O&M piece of that outage be different than a normal refueling outage? Or will some of it get capitalized, some will be O&M? Like I'm just trying to think about, as you start to give drivers for 2014, how the Callaway refueling schedule will impact things.","Martin J. Lyons","Yes. So Michael, I think sitting here today, we're not giving out our 2014 guidance, and I'll give more specificity when we do along those -- along the Callaway outage. However, I don't believe that the 2014 O&M costs are expected to be materially different than the 2013 cost.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then those -- when you did the 2013 cost, what was the cost of that outage that happened in the spring?","Douglas Fischer","Well, it'll -- this is Doug. It's in the Q. I don't have it precisely. Maybe we can...","Martin J. Lyons","We'll try to dig that one out for you too, Michael. But as Doug said, it's in the -- we did disclose that in the...","Douglas Fischer","When the Q is filed, it will be clearly in there.","Operator","Mr. Fischer, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Douglas Fischer","Thank you, all, for participating in this call. Let me -- excuse me, let me remind you again that this call is available for 1 year on our website. You may also call the contacts listed on the release. Financial analyst inquiries should be directed to me, Doug Fisher, or my associate, Matt Thayer. Media should call Joe Mellencamp. Our contact numbers are on the news release we issued today. Again, thank you for your interest in Ameren, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."]}}
