At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry Kircher","","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.","Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ.","Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our Web site today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have the opportunity to review our second quarter results with you.","As today's release detailed, we had a strong quarter operationally and financially. All reported results exceeded our expectations, and we're progressing on achievement of our full year financial objectives.","These results reflect the execution being achieved across our businesses as the corporation operated at a very strong level in providing critical solutions to our customers while returning value to our stockholders. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, and I thank them for all that they do on a daily basis.","Our strong year-to-date financial performance also enabled us to again increase full year 2014 guidance for segment and consolidated operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. Bruce will cover the financial results in detail later.","First, I want to congratulate our Mission Systems and Training team on their successful capture of three key new business awards this past quarter as well as recognize our Space Systems group for their capture of a multibillion extension on an essential National Security program.","One of the highlights of the quarter was Mission Systems and Training's competitive win of the Space Fence program. This contract will enable our corporation to provide a critical capability to our nation for tracking more than 200,000 orbiting space objects and increase the ability to prevent collisions with space-based debris.","MST was also notified of two significant helicopter new business events this quarter. With announcements from the U.S. Air Force on the Combat Search-and-Rescue Helicopter program award and from the Naval Air Systems Command with the award of the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement program. These awards will utilize our systems engineering expertise as we provide significant capabilities on these important helicopter recapitalization programs. Our role will be just to support Sikorsky, who is the prime contractor on both these programs.","Turning to Space Systems, our team was able to expand a key franchise program with a receipt of additional production lots for spacecraft 5 and 6 on the Space-Based Infrared System, SBIRS.","SBIRS spacecraft provide essential missile defense and warning capability to our nation and allies to counter the growing proliferation of offensive ballistic missiles around the world. These two awards expand our backlog at work and help position our corporation for long-term growth in core markets.","In addition to the notable new business awards, we also announced two strategic acquisitions in closely aligned core business areas. To expand our portfolio satellite launch preparation services, we acquired Astrotech Space Operations. Their addition compliments our existing capabilities in satellite design, production and integration.","We also announced the acquisition of Zeta Associates to further strengthen our national security capabilities in the areas of collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of critical information for intelligence and defense communities. Closing of both of these acquisitions is expected to occur in the third quarter, and they will be managed by our Space System business area.","I'd like to move to F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide a summary status of the program. New business support of the program continues to grow with announcements in this quarter from two of our cooperative partner countries to procure the F-35 for their future fighter needs.","Australia announced their decision to purchase 58 additional F-35 aircraft, bringing their total current procurement level to 72 aircraft.","Additionally, Turkey finalized their commitment to procure their initial buy of F-35 fighters, reflecting their confidence in the program to provide fifth generation fighter capability to their nation.","It's exciting to see expanding levels of international and domestic procurement of the aircraft as we work to deliver these revolutionary assets to our nation and allies. But we had numerous accomplishments on the development program this past quarter, we were obviously disappointed with the necessary grounding of the aircraft fleet in response to an engine fire and damage to an Air Force jet at Eglin Air Force Base on June 23rd.","Subsequent engineering and safety analysis, including an inspection of the entire F-35 aircraft fleet have been completed. Flight operations were allowed to resume last week, but there were some limitations until final root cause of the engine failure and identification of any corrective actions is completed.","I'd like to turn to some of the accomplishment achieved this quarter on the development program. That included achieving over 17,000 cumulative flight hours on program, demonstrating air-to-air combat capability and completing the first flight test with Version 3I software.","Another significant accomplishment was the successful landing of a carrier variant aircraft at the maximum test speed and drop rate. This success further paved us the way to conducting carrier landings at sea later this year.","In the software arena, we're conducting final checkout in testing of the Version 2B software, and are confident of being ready for initial operating capability of this turbo aircraft in 2015 for the U.S. Marine Corps.","We're also progressing well on Version 3I software that will achieve the planned IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016.","Before leaving the F-35, I'd like to briefly outline our recently announced Blueprint for Affordability agreement with the Department of Defense on the Joint Strike Fighter program. This agreement is designed to reduce the price of a new F-35 to under $80 million and then-year dollars by 2019 at a level at or below the price of the fourth generation fighters.","Achievement of cost reductions will enable domestic and international customers to buy a fifth generation fighter with its far more advanced technology and capabilities as they capitalize their fighter fleets. The need to replace fourth generation fighters is becoming even more acute due to the aging of the current fleet and increased strategic thrust to the aircraft.","The agreement calls for our corporation and key subcontractors, Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to make total combined investments of up to $170 million in affordability initiatives from 2014 to 2016.","Recoupment of our investments with an accessible return is included in the agreement after achievement of reduced cost of F-35 aircraft in future years. Our focus on cost reductions and affordability will be aided by this agreement as we strive to produce the F-35 for our customers at the lowest possible price.","Beyond the F-35, I was in the United Kingdom last week at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford and also the Farnborough International Air Show where I had the opportunity to meet with many current and potential customers.","My impression from those meetings is that the demand for our portfolio of products is strong and growing. We see broad-based customer interest in areas ranging from fighter and cargo aircraft to missile defense systems, tactical missiles, C4ISR and IT solutions. Customers are very interested in our evolving technologies, focus areas, where we're working to extend and expand the value and capabilities of our core programs.","One item that I'd highlight is the demonstration of our focus on providing innovative and different capabilities to an existing program. We're seeing on our LM-100J commercial airlifter program. The LM-100J is the civil version of our proven and cost-effective C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, and build upon the legacy of the airlifter for its new commercial customers.","We were particularly pleased to announce that we secured a letter of intent for our new LM-100J commercial airlifter. This customer has the opportunity to purchase up to 10 aircrafts, and we believe the potential demand for this airlifter will only grow in the future.","The final topic I'd like to speak briefly about is the decision we made this past quarter outlining revisions in our defined-benefit pension plan for salaried employees. We took actions to freeze certain of our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans in a two-phased approach and transition the effected employees to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.","Taking these actions will allow us to better manage our financial obligations at a more predictable weight, while still providing valuable retirement savings to employees. Our goal is to offer competitive benefits that align with our global security and aerospace peers, while also attracting and retaining the talent that is so vital to our success.","These changes will provide current and future employees with an employee retirement savings plan that is very competitive in the marketplace, while positioning our pension expenses on a more affordable and sustainable level for the corporation.","I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of second quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance. And then we'll open up the line for your questions. Bruce?","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's start with Chart three, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down slightly from last year, but actually a little ahead of our expectations.","Segment operating profit was strong at $1.4 billion, and this performance along with the improvement in our FAS\/CAS pension adjustment increased net earnings by 3%, and increased earnings per share to $2.76.","We had a stronger cash quarter than expected generating $977 million in cash from operations. And we increased our full year outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So I think we had a strong quarter and first half of the year.","Turning to chart four, and then comparing our sales and segment operating profit results for the second quarter this year versus last year, sales were down slightly compared with last year, but as I just noted this was ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was about $100 million lower than the same period last year. The last year we had the benefits of contractual resolutions that were not repeated this year. Adjusting for these favorable items, our segment operating performance was comparable to last, and again was broad based across our business areas.","Chart five shows that earnings per share increased by $0.12 or 5% over last year. EPS grew despite the lower segment operating profit due to the change in the FAS\/CAS pension adjustment from an expense last year to income this year.","On chart six, we will compare our cash from operations for the second quarter of last year. Cash generated was just under $1 billion in the quarter or 57% higher than the second quarter last year. The strong performance in the second quarter led to an increase in our outlook for the year as we will discuss on the next chart.","Chart seven, provided our current outlook compared with what we've provided in the first quarter. We are maintaining our orders outlook at between $41.50 billion and $43 billion, but we are actually ahead of our planned order level through the first six months. We have the large C-130 multiyear order planned for late in the fourth quarter. And with the size of that order we believe it's prudent to leave the order outlook unchanged.","Similarly for sales we are tracking nicely to our current guidance. We are increasing outlook for segment operating profit by $125 million reflecting the strong performance to the first half of the year. With the changes we announced this quarter to freeze our pension plan, we were required to re-measure our pension plan assets and benefit obligations.","In addition to the freeze, the re-measurement incorporated a new longevity estimate along with a lower discount rate and the net effect of these changes was $100 million increase in our FAS\/CAS pension income for the next six months. We increased our operating profit outlook by $225 million to recognize both the segment operating profit and FAS\/CAS pension income increases.","We also increased our earnings per share guidance by $0.35 and we will discuss this in more detail in a couple of charts. Finally, we increased cash from operations by $100 million to greater than or equal to $4.8 billion.","On chart eight, we have our sales outlook for the year by business area which remains unchanged.","Chart nine shows our updated guidance for segment operating profit. We increased outlook for operating profit by $105 million for space system and by $20 million for aeronautics. For Space Systems this reflects strong performance to-date along with growing confidence that two large delivery events planned for the second half of the year will both happen this year. The increase in profit for aeronautics recognizes the performance to the first half of the year being ahead of our expectations.","Moving on to chart 10, we will discuss the increase on our earnings per share guidance. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit raised our outlook by $0.25 per share while the $100 million increase in FAS\/CAS pension income raised the outlook by another $.20 per share.","In addition, we reevaluated certain tax reserve positions resulting in an increase in tax expense in the second quarter. Netting all of these changes our new earnings per share guidance increased a total of $0.35 for the year to a new range of between $10.85 and $11.15 per share.","On chart 11, we thought it will be helpful to describe how the pension changes we made will affect our expectations for FAS\/CAS income and pension funding and recovery over the next few years. As with all these projections it's important to remember that they are all based on current regulations and include our June 2014 assumptions for discount rate at 4.25% which is 50 basis points lower than what we used at the end of last year.","The projections also incorporate new longevity assumptions, our long-term asset return of 8% and demographics holding constant or as I'd like to say current course and speed. We expect lower FAS expense in the future and that would make our FAS\/CAS income in 2015 about twice the 2014 level and increasing the 2016 level about a half a billion dollars above the 2015 level.","For pension funding and recovery, we'd expect our contributions to the pension trust over the next few years to be similar to are lower than the 2014 level, and the future benefits associated with the roughly $10 billion we have funded but not yet recovered would remain in tact.","Recoveries in 2015 and 2016 are expected to be sequentially higher than 2014 and essentially keeping pace with the increases in FAS\/CAS income over the next two years.","Finally, chart 12 provides our summary for the quarter. We are pleased with the performance with the first half of the year as it results from continued strong program execution along with taking proactive measures and the benefits of a portfolio of programs that is second to none.","We expect to resume discretionary share repurchases in the third quarter and this leaves us well positioned to achieve the higher outlooks that we provided today.","With that, we are ready for your questions. Shannon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sam Pearlstein at Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Sam.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments you're making in terms of the F-35 to reduce the cost. I guess I'm wondering does it impact your booking margin on the program, and how much is it shared amongst your partners, because it would seem like near-term it should have a downward effect even if you can then recover it on the backend? So I'm just trying to understand how the mechanics of that work.","Marillyn Hewson","Bruce, why don't you take that?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Sam, I'll jump in there. So, we're calling this the Blueprint for Affordability. As Marillyn said, the overall objective is to put our money where our mouth is, quite frankly, because we think there are investments that could be made that will reduce the cost of the aircrafts over the next few years below what it could otherwise track to.","So the thought is, as Marillyn said, about $170 million up to $170 million spread over a couple of years. You could think of that, Sam, as sort of proportional in terms of the investment contributions to the work share of our partners. So, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and BAE would be expected -- although it's not required because not all the investments frankly will fall along that line, but for planning purposes you should expect just kind of proportional to the work share that we each have there.","The recovery of that is tied to achieving those cost reductions. And as Marillyn said, we would expect to recover that investment plus an appropriate return on that investment. So, Sam, to your question on booking rate impact, I don't expect this to have any negative impact on the booking rates for those lots affected unless we are unable to achieve the cost reductions that we are projecting in the basis for those investments. So if we do what we say we can do then you would see no impact on booking rates as a result of that.","Marillyn Hewson","I just want to add to it. This really is an exciting acquisition reform type of an initiative. We think it's groundbreaking in terms of bringing this F-35 program. We've been working closely with the Department of Defense for the past year to come up with this agreement, and it lines right up with Frank Kendall's blueprint. He has a better eye power of 2.0. And where they have asked us to come up with innovative ways to drive down cost has boosted, just volume will bring the cost down. We expect that probably 75% to 80% of the cost reduction comes through just ramping up production.","So the numbers that I started around bringing the cost of the aircraft down will depend first and foremost on that volume reduction, but at the same time we will remake these investments and cost reduction initiatives. That will be the balance of it to bring it down to a fourth generation priced aircraft by 2019 in then-year dollars. So we're very excited about -- and we've already got projects underway.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Bruce, could you walk through some of the puts and takes in the pension numbers, headwinds and tailwinds, obviously the discount rate we have that from the K, but the mortality and then the upside from the freeze?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So you're talking about sort of FAS\/CAS income change for the next six months?","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Yeah. All the details, you have netted the number to a positive 100 billion.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Let me give you the pieces, and I should point out, Rob, what I'm going to talk to you today is also going to be in the Q that you will see, the 10-Q that you will see filed tomorrow.","So we started off with an expectation of FAS\/CAS pension income of about $345 million for the year. You should think of the design change that we are incorporating, so that comes in sort of two stages. We have freezing of the salary benefits effective 01-01-2016, and then we have the services benefit will freeze at 01-01 of 2020. That will be essentially a full freeze of the pension plan at that point in time.","The results of those amendment changes, if you will, is an improvement of about $435 million compared to what we otherwise would have had without that. We actually had a positive through the first six months of the year that we recognized when we were required to re-measure assets and benefit obligations. We did better -- our long-term assumption for the rate of return on assets is 8%. So if we just break that into two six months chinks, you would have said, the first six months should have been about 4% return, we actually did better than that. And that better return resulted in $85 million net improvement.","The increased longevity impact for the year is about $265 million negative impact to the income that would otherwise have occurred this year. And then the discount rate reduction again about 50 bips as I said earlier is about $155 million. So hopefully if my math is right that locks us from the $345 million to the $445 million pension income and that's the net $100 million benefit there.","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Does that work with that?","Bruce Tanner","I'll say yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. You may begin.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen","Yes. Thank you. I think you've just answered my question. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may begin.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much. Marillyn, your focus on affordability is notable, I think, because of the Pentagon I guess and the navy called out two of your business units forgetting Top Chairman Awards. How important is that and what does that say about how are you going to push the rest of the business units to capture those achievements?","Marillyn Hewson","Howard, thank you for your question and thanks for the recognition for the folks that are doing the right thing that the navy and others have focused on our performance. So we are excited about that. Frankly, affordability is a daily focus for us across the entire corporation. Every one of our business areas is tracking to drive cost out of the business and look at how they can bring innovation forward into to some of their products in order to make them more affordable for the customer.","So it isn't just those that happened to get the recognition from our customers which we highly value and appreciate. But it is across the business that we are doing this. I know if you look back at what we've done in terms of reducing our footprint with our square footage reductions, shutting down some of our facilities, things that we are doing across our overhead structure and our expenditures. And at the same time, how we are looking at making sure that we are performing on a daily basis, so that if you look at our operational execution this quarter and for the past several quarters, I've never seen our programs performing better by putting off quality products on time, under budget and meeting the commitments of our customers.","The recognition that you highlighted was from the navy and not all other business areas work with the navy. So we would seek similar recognition from other services whereas warranted because we are across the board working on affordability. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, George.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Bruce, I wondered if there is still a little bit more in aeronautics. I mean you basically have a lot of puts and takes there like you get 40 million more F-22 sales and pick up 35 million profits. The R&D programs explained by -- you took the charge last year; F-35 sales were up 210 million, but no change in the profit. So is that an issue of where you are in the LRIP program. So kind of you just explained some of those comments.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So maybe I'll just hit all the moving pieces in aeronautics, George. And hopefully I'll capture the intent of your question there. So collectively, I think, let's see we were up about 135 sales in aeronautics, almost $450 million about in line with what our expectations were. We said all along that we expect to have aeronautics be really the only business area that has any significant growth to speak of. That of course was led by the F-35 program.","You mentioned about $210 million of that came from the production program. The total F-35 program was just under $300 million with the difference coming on SDD contract. Most of that increase on the SDD coming because we don't have the negative profit adjustment that was taken in the same quarter of last year.","C-130s were up about $75 million or so, really it was just one additional aircraft this year versus last. C-5 a similar story, one additional aircraft and a partial -- was up about $45 million. That is attributable to one additional aircraft that was partially offset because of a little bit of lower support in spares this year compared to last. As you said, the F-22 is about $40 million, almost all of that F-22 sales volume resulted from the higher risk retirements on a number of programs within the F-35 program that we are about $35 million of that 40 in total.","You talked about the, I think, your question was the F-35 production program up about $210 million while the profit level was flat, and what that really results from, George, is just as you speculated, we did have a number of higher risk retirements in the second quarter of last year that were not repeated this year. I think that's just a facing of when those events occurred. It's not something that's causing a long-term concern on my part. And I think we are performing actually very well and the production programs, we are at large as we sit here today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on missile defense and MEADS versus Patriot. Can you just describe a little bit on where we are today with MEADS from a revenue perspective? And if we don't get any additional fuel sign there when does that revenue stream trail off? And then maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, the MEADS versus Patriot and how much you care either way, which direction this all goes?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, you take the revenue question and I'll talk about the competitive environment.","Bruce Tanner","Good. I get the same thoughts on there, Marillyn. So I was trying to write those down as you were talking, Jason. So revenue stream and what's the current \u2026 ","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Yeah \u2026 ","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, current revenue level; you should think of it as fairly minimal right now. And that primarily because the development program that has been undergoing for the better part is, I don't know, five, six, seven years or so that is now sort of wound down to the end. The actual sales or revenue that is being generated by the program is not all that consequential. When that would falloff is sort of when the development program finishes which is -- it's not close to the end of this year, maybe a little bit into early next year. But that's sort of the profile you should think in terms of the revenue profile that we are looking at.","What we are always trying to do is now convert this from this program that is sort of finished at the end of this development into a production contract. That's what we are trying to do. That's what we are trying to do in Poland. I think the next opportunity is probably going to come up in Germany. I'll let Marillyn maybe discuss the more strategic views of Meads versus Patriot.","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. Thanks, Bruce. We are continuing MEADS, frankly, I will just say right upfront we are disappointed the Polish government announced that they are down selected to two offerings and MEADS didn't make that down select. Because we really believe that offers the best capability is the most modern mobile unit that's 360 degree capability open architecture. It has got all of the things that we think was a very good offering for the Polish government. At the same time as you know iterating Germany have invested a significant amount of their funds into the program collectively reviewed as government.","The next opportunity for us is to continue to work with Germany and Italy on developing their future here in missile defense system. Germany will be making the decision later in this year. We feel very good about how MEADS will stack up in that competition. As I said they have made a significant investment, they understand the capabilities. So we expect that to be strong. The program itself, as Bruce said, we are going to continue through the development phase on it and we also expect that the U.S. army will continue to review it and figure out how they can harvest some of the technology from MEADS.","Also just to highlight for you, we still benefit as well from the Patriot system, because there as you saw the recent opportunity with Cutter being announced and others, we are on the Patriot system with our missile with the PAC-3. So both systems will have an opportunity for that we are front and center in the marketplace with MEADS and expect that Germany and Italy will look seriously in, there are other countries as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Yes, good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Doug.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Staying on this area, missiles and fire control, all of these were lighter than normal during the quarter. I wonder if you could give us a sense of how you're looking at the outlook for that group in terms of order flow. Obviously PAC-3, those are important parts of that, so maybe you could give us a sense of where the international opportunities are and how do you see that unit moving over time?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, I will take that one on, Doug. So I think the biggest near-term international order for missile and fire control is probably the PAC-3 for Cutter. Marillyn mentioned that as well just a second ago. That's probably one that we are looking for. Hopefully, I think we had a signing ceremony in the Pentagon here in the last couple of weeks that will lead to a contract award to us hopefully some time in the third quarter.","One that may not be on your scope, Doug, that's a big sized order for us, and it's one that's worth discussing is potentially about a 1 billion order for the scout fighting vehicle in the U.K., this is basically putting a new churn and new capabilities on an existing fighting vehicle, combat fighting vehicle in the U.K., and that's being operated -- are performed by our LMUK operation. So that's a fairly sizable opportunity that we are very excited about. We think that actually has some export potential even beyond the U.K. for that vehicle.","Those are two, the bigger ones that we are looking at in terms of international orders. But I'll just say looking at the rest of the year expectation for missile and fire controls, we are trying to get back to about the similar level of backlog is where we ended the year at 2013. And of course we always have the fourth quarter of our calendar year being the first quarter of the new fiscal year and we tend to get a lot of our domestic orders in that quarter and I would expect that will happen again this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Okay, thank you. For Space Systems you mentioned that the EBIT upside relative to prior guidance is going to come from two deliveries now happening at the back half. Why didn't that impact the sales guidance as well?","Bruce Tanner","It's a good question, Yair. And let me just say there is probably -- I'll say, maybe like three moving pieces that are going out in the space guidance, and I'll address the sales as well here. So first and foremost, we've had better performance year-to-date. Some of that has come on the back on the United Launch Alliance. That sort of hired to-date performance is going to carryout for the rest of the year. So that's part of the increase there.","Secondly, recall probably both the fourth quarter call of last and the first quarter call this year. I talked about some continuing restructuring charges particularly as we are shutting down some facilities and relocating operations from those facilities elsewhere within the space system's portfolio. So those charges have actually turned out to be a little lighter than we expected that they would be when we set the guidance for this year. Importantly to note they are still back half loaded in the year, but the total year is expected to be lower than what we initially envisioned in the -- when we gave the guidance for 2014.","Then specifically to your point on the two launch vehicles, we probably had a little more contingency or conservatism in our profit guidance associated with those items only because our profit guidance range is pretty narrow frankly for Space Systems Company. I think it was at $30 million or so from the low end to the high end. These are items that are probably event sized at least collectively. Whereas the sales are probably contained within the $300 million range that we give already for the sales guidance. So while I recognize why that could seem like a disconnect I think it's because of the size of the ranges per sales versus the size of ranges for earnings.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Bruce, I wanted to get a capital deployment update from you. On M&A you guys have been kind of doing smaller things in areas of growth. Others in the space have suggested M&A could pick up. I wonder if you think that's possible. What's the probability that that annual number for LOCKHEED moves into the billions rather than hundreds of millions. Then on the share repurchase any color you could give on the anticipated pace at which that picks back up since you mentioned that's going to happen?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. I'll jump in a little bit on the M&A question. I'll see that if Marillyn has any maybe overarching thoughts than I provide. I think the short answer that your question, if I could repeat, it was sort of you have done some smaller acquisitions and what's the potential that we could end up with maybe more than $1 billion in a year instead of spend a several hundred millions of dollars in a year. I think the short answer to that is that it's opportunistic. It's what we see with -- we've always at least since I've been in this job, we look heck of a lot more opportunities for M&A than we ever execute on. That's because we don't think all that makes sense obviously. So if we find more deals that makes sense for us both strategically, financially and operationally, then we'll close that. There is not a certain number if you go that we are trying to stay below or trying to exceed and getting that number.","I think historically -- if you take a look at our capital deployment and our share repurchase plan, we ended the year last year at about $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We've grown that. I think we are at about $3.4 billion or so today. I think I said on the last call that we would probably try to get to a share repurchase that will bring us about in line with where we ended last year with cash on the balance sheet, and you can probably solve for that number better than I can, frankly. But that's probably my best indication of what the remaining expectation at least on our part is for share repurchases to the rest of the year. I'll ask and see if Marillyn has any different thoughts on the M&A question.","Marillyn Hewson","Not different, Bruce. I think you covered it well. I mean we will continue to look at selective acquisitions that really makes sense for us. We were looking at things that give us new access to end markets or some unique technology or capability or things that did with our core or that are very near to our core, just as the ones that we've done in the past quarter line up very well with our core business. We recently -- in the previous quarter we bought industrial defender, which is a leading provider for cyber security solutions. So you can look at the things that we're buying and if they create value and they're strategically and operationally lineup with what we want to do, then we're going to continue to look for those opportunities.","As you can tell from what Bruce has described, I mean we have a lot of capability on our balance sheet to do what we think makes sense. We're just going to go along our normal process of assessing and determining if it's a good bid for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Rob Stallard - RBC","Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Rob.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Rob Stallard - RBC","First, just a couple of quick guidance questions; what do you expect the full year tax rate to be? And also, what are the factors that you see weighing on the aeronautic margin in the second half? Thank you.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Thanks, Rob. So, I think it will be somewhere in the -- I think of it probably in the 32% range, maybe a little bit lower than that as we sit here today. So, one wildcard obviously is whether or not we have the R&D tax credit between now and the end of the year and\/or I believe will ultimately get R&D tax credit at some point in the future whether it happens this year, but we had the retroactive event like happened last year. I hate to predict that. But that's not included in the tax numbers that I just gave to you, Rob.","And the second question was on the aeronautic, sort of the second half of the year. So, as we sit here today we've actually had very good performance in the first six months for aeronautics as I said probably repeatedly in the opening remarks better than our expectations. As we look today at the guidance that we're providing that would suggest that we're going to have lower margins in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Not hugely lower, but that's the result of our lower planned risk retirements as we sit here today, and I think of how we're planning for those risk retirements in the future.","The first half had the benefit of some of those exceeding our expectations, and I think there is some potential upside that we could exceed our expectations of what we have planned for those second half risk retirements today.","The other piece that has a negative push on margins in the second half is obviously the rising volume of the F-35 program at the lower margins on the overall aeronautics margin. That will continue to happen in the second half of the year as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning. First, just a clarification where you gave us ton of moving parts in the pension, but can you give us what the FAS and the CAS components were, but the actual question is more on space, where this is the fourth year in a row where you put up or you're going to put up 13%, maybe better margins, it looks like there are even some conservatism up in the second half. Is this 13% margin business on a go-forward basis?","Bruce Tanner","Myles, it surprised me a little bit. So, space has the benefit obviously -- I'm going to answer your second question first, I guess, and I'll come back to the FAS\/CAS. So, space has the benefit of getting quite a significant portion of equity earnings associated with our 50-50 joint venture in United Launch Alliance. So, the actual margins on the rest of space is business, because we're recognizing the profit, but not recognizing the sales, has a boost in the profit that's not inherent in the rest of the portfolio.","We also have a joint venture in the U.K., where we're also accounting for it with equity earnings with the atomic weapons establishment, although it's a much lower piece of it. You think of the two of those as adding a pretty good boost, the margins of space. And those have increased over the past few years over what they were, say, three, four, five years ago.","We also had the transition in space of having a number of programs in concurrent development. And almost every single one of those programs is now in full rate production as much as I can say full rate production for space which is usually small quantities of spacecraft. So, programs like SBIRS, Advanced EHF, even to a certain extent the GPS III were on the tail end or hopefully completed with the development of a lot of those satellites and we're now in production. And you'd expect to see higher margins during that performance.","Also, I'll just say the performance on other special programs activities within space has been outstanding, both from a capabilities perspective as well as the financial performance there. So, whether or not we can continue that, Myles, I think we've got a little bit of actually negative as I talked about earlier in terms of the restructuring costs that eventually will go away.","You should also think though that we have about $40 million a year I think associated with the formation of ULA that is a recurring benefit, that I think expires in 2016 or 2017, I've lost track with. So, that's associated with the game we had on the contribution to form United Launch Alliance, I guess spread over 10 years.","So, will those offset the restructuring charges going away in the end of that recurring benefit at the end of the 10 years, that's the challenge for us and to see whether or not we can maintain that streak?","So I think you asked specifically, what are the FAS\/CAS numbers, so I gave you the net at $445 million. But CAS does not change. So, I still think of it roughly some billion, six, and the FAS expense, and I'm rounding some numbers here, I think FAS expense changes to about $1150 million for the year, and I think that probably nets the 450, but that's kind of the close to the pin math.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JP Morgan. You may begin.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Good morning. Why don't you drill a little bit into the Mission Systems and Training segment? First of all, just if you could give a little color on the reserves you recorded on the programs in the quarter. And then just secondly, maybe higher level, I think this was the first quarter where you had a negative profit adjustment since you started giving all that level of detail over the last three years. And I know you had a tough compare with the settlement of presidential helicopter from last year, but higher level -- what's the momentum in terms of performance in this segment that it's been so good over the last couple of years? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So, I'll try just the moving pieces there, Joe. Thanks for the question. So, most of the reserve -- I guess all the reserve that we took in the quarter is really associated with the training and logistic solutions part of the business. This is a part of business that really serves the variety of customers including the U.S. government international customers as well as commercial customers.","And you should think of this business at least in large part, you have to have products developed and ready for the market in order to be able to be competitive in this marketplace, which means to me that you have to sometimes make best in terms of sort of the configurations, the capabilities and the quantities of these new products.","We probably didn't make all the right bets here, and so we established some reserves in the case that some of the risk associated with some of the inventory that's on the balance sheet today simply doesn't find a home in the long-term.","You talk about this being the first quarter of sort of the negative hit there, and you're right. What I'm pleased with is, is essentially even with that reserve that we established for the training logistic solutions business, there were offsetting step ups or risk retirements that mitigated essentially to the full extent that reserve that was established, such that the net change for the quarter-over-quarter was really just the change in the contractual resolutions that happened last year that didn't happened this year. So, that's the way I think of it.","Well, the big reserve that was established, we also have big risk retirements that were planned in the quarter that helped to mitigate that. I'll say that the second half step ups that are planned at least from a risk retirement perspective in the second half of the year are probably going to be comparable to what we saw on the second half of 2013, and always say that's sort of the current planning, the current thinking as we sit here today. So, that's your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thank you for taking my question. Bruce, just two clarifications a little bit separate; first, on international revenue as a percentage, it looks like you're going to hit your 20% target this year. I'm curious if there is another target that we should be thinking about years in the future and then separately on pensions. You presented some very good detail on FAS\/CAS and prepayments. One of the areas of pushback that I sometimes hear is that you do have a lot of contributions coming that will eat into what the cash windfall might look like. I was hoping that you could perhaps offer some detail on that point. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Thank you. So, first question, John, on the international revenue and where we're going, I think when I look around, I think we did right at or just under 20% in the quarter. So, you're right. We're hitting our number. The goal is clearly to be higher. One thing frame of reference-wise is if we do what we believe we'll do from an order perspective this year and we end up at the backlog level that we're hoping for, probably 30% of that backlog could be international business.","So, I'll probably defer to Marillyn as setting the new goal for the company, but I'd like the thing that if we haven't has the 20%, we're real close, and I'd think that there \u2013- just by virtue of the backlog that we expect to have, we should have a higher number than that in the years to come.","Probably the best time for us to describe that is in October when we give you trend information for next year. And frankly we're kind of smacked in the middle of our planning process right now. So, I probably hesitate to pick the number directly until we've had a chance to take a look at that planning information and get back to you in the October timeframe.","I think your second question was on the contributions coming, is that ahead. So, I'll try to give you some visibility into that as far as the future contributions that we have planned in '15 and '16 at least, where I said they'd either be equal to or lower than the 2014 level. That's probably about as much insight as I want to give right now. I think the important part is the net cash, at least as I like to think about that. And net cash is going to be increasing pretty substantially. I may have spoken a little bit of code when I gave you that information, but hopefully you follow the information that we were providing there.","And that is expecting to continue, and the flipside that I like to always remind people is -- and I've talked about this in the earlier March. We have this $10 billion or so of advanced funding, but it's yet to be recovered just a year ago or so, that was $9 billion. Those assets are sitting in our pension trust today and they're accruing interests at the same rate as our asset return is making. And so, one different way to think about possibly is we're doing a whole lot better with those assets invested in our pension trust, and if they were doing nothing, but sitting on the balance sheet.","And so, I don't think it's a bad use of that cash. And as long as we can continue to satisfy the constituents in terms of dividends repurchases to our shareholders, doing the investments we need to make with our customers, I think that's a good use of our overall cash deployment as we sit here today.","Marillyn Hewson","I'd just like to add to Bruce's comments on the international side, well, we're not going to give you a specific number today. I mean aspirationally we're going to continue to grow in our international area. We're very much focused on that expansion of our business. It is where the growth opportunities are for us. We think we're extraordinarily well positioned with our portfolio for growth.","F-35 certainly is one area, because we see in the next five years almost 50% of the orders are going to come from the international arena, but in addition to that as we talked about, missile defense, there was outstanding demand for that around the world. We see a lot of opportunities and a full range of our capabilities. And we're going to continue to grow. We even realigned our organization such that we have more leadership and focus and resources from an enterprise standpoint so that we can win in that marketplace, and I think that's a good thought, Bruce, that we come back in the fall and given that a new target, but believe me, it will be about 20%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hi, good morning, almost good afternoon. Just -- I wondered if you could expand a little bit on this pension piece, the delta in the FAS number would most likely relate to the actuarial amortization, not service and interest cost I'd assume since those aren't changing and the benefits until 2016 and 2020, where does that bring the plan now that you've re-measured from a funded status on a PBO basis, and then when you look out longer term, is that substantially lower? Does that have a materials impact on the longer term cash reimbursements you'd expect to see as these prepayment credits are then collected and then you look beyond that?","Bruce Tanner","You got your money's worth for the question, Carter. So \u2026 ","Carter Copeland - Barclays","I'm trying my glass \u2026 ","Bruce Tanner","I think I'll answer your second question first. So, on a FAS basis, amazingly enough, our funded level ends up about the same point as end of the year last year about 78% with all the moving pieces on an Arista reserve basis, which is obviously more important one, because that actually determines our funding level. We stayed about the 90% level just as again as where we ended the year last year.","I'm not sure I follow frankly the first part of your question, Carter, but I'll say that -- I'll just go back to the details that I gave. I can't remember who I provided that to, frankly, but the pieces of the $100 million and the various components of that in terms of pension change. So there were -- the real estimates that we took are affecting both service costs and actuarial losses to use the, speak of the FASB and the 10-K and the 10-Q disclosure. So, those did affect both the service cost and the actuarial losses this year. And they affected it just for the last six months of the year.","So, you should think of those as increasing in future years only because there will be a full year worth of cost versus our service benefits versus half years for the same items there.","And I think your last question had to do with how does this affect recovery? What I'll try to convey is that I think our recovery remain strong. And I think I gave some insight as to what that will look like, and clearly relative to this $10 billion that we keep talking about in terms of pre-funding or funding advance of the requirements, that is going to continue to drive our overall cash collections for the next decade or so, and you're starting to see that materialize now and in the not too distant future.","Shannon, I think that's getting us on top of the hour here, maybe, Marillyn, some final thoughts or \u2026 ","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. Let me wrap up. I just want to conclude today's call by reiterating that we had another excellent quarter, and we, in my view, continue to be very well positioned to deliver even higher value to our customers and our stockholders in 2014.","So, we want to thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking to you at our next earnings call in October.","Shannon, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

And welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Gardner","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Please join me today on the call -- joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's news release, our SEC filings and chart two on the webcharts for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","As noted, we have posted charts on our website today that are -- that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. All of here, hope your New Year is off to a good start. Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. Their dedication and focus enabled us to achieve outstanding program and financial performance during a dynamic year of transition and I want to thank them for their efforts.","Our performance as a corporation allowed us to exceed all of our full year goals and has positioned us for future growth and to continue to deliver value to customers and stockholders in 2017. While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later, I want to highlight a few noteworthy 2016 financial accomplishments from my perspective.","2016 was an exceptional year of achievement, with all of our financial metrics exceeding our expectations and in the case of sales, earnings per share and cash from operations exceeding our previous historical high watermarks.","I was especially pleased with our performance in maintaining our focus on new business wins and building backlog. We received almost $19 billion in order bookings in the fourth quarter, which resulted in our achieving a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and a year-end backlog of over $96 billion. This represents over $1 billion increase from 2015 year-end level and reflects the broad demand for our products from both domestic and international customers.","Significant awards included $7.2 billion for our F-35 LRIP 10 and definitized contract action agreement, a $1.5 billion award for PAC-3 missiles defense capabilities for United States and allied military forces and $1.2 billion from the Republic of Korea Air Force to upgrade 134 of their F-16 aircraft. Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us [Technical Difficulty]. Sorry for the interruption there [inaudible] (03:57). Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us to deliver expanding sales level and outstanding financial results as we move forward.","Another area where we are, it sounds like somebody is not on mute. Let me just continue. Another area where we were successful with our strategic focus on cash and cash deployment, in 2016 we generated nearly $5.2 billion in cash from operations, reflecting the commitment focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers on a daily basis and we expect to exceed our initial three-year $15 billion commitment we originally laid out in October of 2014 by $1 billion. This strong cash generation also enabled us to continue our longstanding cash deployment strategy.","In 2016, we returned 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders through our competitive dividend and ongoing share repurchase activity. Keeping with cash deployment our 2016 share repurchases exceeded $2 billion and coupled with the shares retired earlier in the year as part of our divestiture of the IS&GS business allowed us to reduce our year-end outstanding share count to below our target one full year ahead of our stated goal. These achievements reflect our ongoing commitment to perform with excellence for our customers and stockholders.","Looking beyond 2016, our 2017 guidance outlined today shows that we are expecting solid organic growth and continued strong cash generation, and Bruce, will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and webcharts.","I'd like to turn now to the status of DOD budget. Currently, the DOD is operating under a continuing resolution through April 28th for fiscal year 2017 with funding constrained to prior FY16 levels. While this will cause funds to be limited for certain DOD programs and likely delay expansion in others, we do not believe our 2017 sales, earnings or cash flows will be affected by this delay in receiving the full appropriations bill. We forecast that prior year's appropriation levels will support our current plans as our broad portfolio of long cycle programs remains well-aligned with our customers\u2019 needs.","Further support for this conclusion is that the continuing resolution also allows for a limited set of exceptions, which include the ability to additionally fund two of our programs, advanced procurement for new multiyear Black Hawk helicopter contract and sufficient funding to maintain the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle program launch capability and schedule. While we believe the possibility of a full-year CR still exist and would not be in the nation's best interest, we are hopeful that a resolution can be reached to maintain our country's readiness and strength.","Separately, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law last month and reflected bipartisan agreement that defense budgets should not return to amounts defined by the Budget Control Act or sequestration levels. I am personally encouraged by that fact, but there is recognition from both parties that global security threats are not decreasing and that in fact we do need to continue to put resources toward our national security and our interoperability with our allies around the world.","We look forward to the upcoming submission of the new administration's budget proposal and continued congressional support for a strong defense and future recapitalization actions both in FY 2017 and beyond. We look forward to working with the new Pentagon team as we collectively look to provide our armed forces with the capabilities needed to perform their crucial missions.","I would like to continue my remarks with a few highlights from the fourth quarter that illustrate the continued upward momentum we have in our operational performance as we delivered daily on the commitments to our customers.","Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we delivered 16 aircraft in the fourth quarter, including the first planes for customers beyond our original eight partnered nations, Japan and Israel. These countries represent our ninth and 10th international customers, and along with South Korea show building international interest and the capabilities of this remarkable plane.","In November, Luke Air Force Base welcome the arrival of its first Foreign Military Sales or FMS aircraft as Japan took ownership of its first F-35, where it will be used to train an elite cadre of Japanese air self-defense pilots and maintainers.","In December I traveled to Israel to attend the delivery ceremony for the first pair of Adir F-35 stealth fighters for the Israeli Air Force. The IAF has embraced the technologies and capabilities of this fifth-generation fighter and believe it will become a powerful accelerator for their entire air force.","Also during the fourth quarter our F-35 backlog grew as we received an undefinitized contract for LRIP 10, which added 90 planes to our flow. This brings our total F-35 orders to-date up to 373 planes. Just as significantly, our 2016 deliveries of 46 jets brought our total deliveries to 200 aircraft at the end of 2016. We expect 2017 to be another inflection point in our production cycle as we now anticipate delivering 66 planes, an increase of over 40% from our 2016 level.","As many of you know, I have the opportunity to meet with President Trump on two occasions prior to his inauguration to discuss our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. We along with our partners share his strong interest in producing this unparalleled aircraft at affordable prices for our warfighters and taxpayers. We believe we are on this path and I'd like to take a moment to give you a quick status of the program.","At this time, I'll ask you to turn to the third page in the webcharts that we have provided. This chart depicts the F-35A model per unit price, which is the Conventional Takeoff and Landing or CTOL variant. The chart also depicts the F-35 program order quantities. The bar graph portion of the chart shows our historical and projected orders.","You will also observe a dark descending line on the graph, which shows the per unit price of our CTOL variant in each LRIP as notated by the axis on the right. You can see from our latest status on our LRIP 9, our current F-35A is now around $100 million apiece and drops below $100 million for LRIP 10.","The LRIP 10 price is currently proposed with represented reduction of over 60% from the first LRIP 1 aircraft and this demonstrates a learning curve as efficient as any achieved on any modern tactical fighter aircraft.","The chart also includes a red dotted line, which represents the government program offices annual budget estimate to Congress of the F-35A unit price. This selected acquisition report or SAR is submitted annually to Congress as part of the yearly budgeting process in advance of our contract negotiations for each lot.","As you can see we have had eight consecutive years of achieving settlement unit prices below the internal government expectations, showing our ongoing commitment to producing this aircraft with increasing affordability.","You will also see the rapid ascent and quantities on the chart. It is with this anticipated trajectory and production that we can continue to see the efficiencies in touch labor, manufacturing techniques and supply chain operations that we project will allow us to meet our stated goal of offering the CTOL version for $85 million by 2019. We believe this will result in the best combination of capability and price of any aircraft ever offered, while at the same time growing valuable job opportunities for our American workforce.","Turning to our Space Systems business area, I'd like to highlight another example of one of our innovative products and the benefits that can be derived from our long-term commitment to technology, our customers and their missions.","In November, we successfully delivered the Lockheed Martin built GOES-R satellite to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The spacecraft was launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and placed into geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above the earth as the first of four in a next-generation weather satellite constellation.","We are excited to be leading the GOES-R program, a collaborative mission between NASA and NOVA, which will provide major improvements to quality, quantity and timeliness of critical weather data. This constellation will improve the detection and observations of meteorological events that directly affect public safety, protection of property and ultimately economic health.","I'm especially pleased that the company's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California contributed key instrumentation that will fly aboard each spacecraft, including the Geostationary Lightning Mapper or GLM.","The GLM will take hundreds of images every second, mapping lightning activity on the earth surface and in the atmosphere. Scientists are hoping to use data from the GLM and GOES-R satellites to provide citizens and public safety officials early warning of severe storms and tornado activity.","Finally, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate our Sikorsky team for delivering the 1,000th H-60M Black Hawk helicopter this past quarter at a ceremony in our Connecticut facility. This version of the Black Hawk dating back to 2007 has been consistently enhanced with more powerful engine, improved airframe and modern avionics, and it is a key element of the Army Aviation Modernization Plan.","The Black Hawk has been noted as the workhorse of army aviation and including the entire Black Hawk family, Sikorsky has delivered over 4,000 Black Hawk helicopters, which have blown over 9 million flight hours. We are honored to be part of this heritage and look forward to continuing this proud legacy.","In closing as I reflect back on our accomplishments over the past year, we completed our strategic actions to better align the business for operational and financial success, and long-term value creation. We increase sales, grew our backlog and had strong cash generation, while continuing to perform with excellence for our customer. Looking to the future, I am enthusiastic about our corporation\u2019s broad portfolio and the growth opportunities that it provides both domestically and internationally.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2017 financial guidance and then we'll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the webchart we included with our earnings release today. My remarks begin on chart four and an overview of our financial results for the year.","Before discussing our 2016 financial results, I want to provide an understanding of the material weakness and internal controls that we described in our earnings release. This materially weakness relates to a number of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is limited to Sikorsky only.","While we have not discovered any material errors in the financial results included in our earnings release today, our reviews of the internal control processes and IT-related controls over financial reporting at Sikorsky indicated a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement could have occurred that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, which is enough to determine that a material weakness in those internal controls exists.","That finding in turn triggered a more thorough review of Sikorsky's financial statements to determine whether or not that potential for misstatement led to an actual material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements and at this time we have not found that to be the case.","We expect to have completed our analysis of Sikorsky's financial statements when we file our Form 10-K in February. Thereafter, the remediation process will continue as we\u2019ll have to correct and then test the remediated controls over several reporting cycles. We will provide updates on our progress as we file our Form 10-Qs in 2017 and we expect that the remediation will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2017.","Moving on now to our 2016 results. Overall, we finish the year a little stronger than the outlook we provided to you in the October call. We obtained the highest sales, earnings per share and cash from operations that we've ever achieved, we continued our track record of returning substantial cash to our stockholders and we grew backlog to more than $96 billion, significantly strong sales volume in the year. So, overall, we are very pleased with our results for 2016 and we think this positions us well as we enter 2017.","I\u2019ll add this, also nice for me and perhaps for you as well, to have the many portfolio shaping activities that occurred during the year behind us, hopefully making it easier to both explain and follow the results of the company going forward.","Turning to chart five, we compare our sales and earnings per share in 2016 versus 2015. Sales were nearly $7 billion higher this year compared with last year and most of that growth came from having a full year of Sikorsky performance and results of RMS for 2016 versus less than two months in 2015 and significant organic growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program.","Earnings per share grew by 25% over last year's level, driven by higher segment operating profit and FAS\/CAS adjustment, the benefit from a lower tax rate and a lower share count due to share repurchases in the year and the results of the share reduction associated with the IS&GS divestiture.","Within the 2016 results we also had the benefit of recognizing the booking resulting from obtaining a controlling interest in the U.K.'s Atomic Weapons Establishment that we discussed on the last call. That gain increased EPS by $0.34 for the year.","Chart six shows our actual cash from operations generated in 2016 and outlook for 2017. During the October call, we discussed that our cash projection in 2016 has significant variability in it driven by about 700 million in F-35 collections that could have been received in either 2016 or 2017 and we sized our 2016 cash from operations at $5 billion or $5.7 billion. We also said that if the $700 million was not received in 2016 it would simply be added to our outlook for 2017 resulting in a two-year outlook for cash from operations of greater than or equal to $10.7 billion.","As it turns out we did not received a $700 million in collections in 2016, but we did generate $5.2 billion in cash from operations even without those collections and we are keeping our 2017 outlook at the $5.7 billion level resulting in a two-year outlook of greater than or equal to $10.9 billion or $200 million more than we said in October.","If you will turn to chart seven we\u2019ll discuss the amount of cash we returned to stockholders in 2016. With our cash from operations of around $5.2 billion and capital expenditures of almost $1.1 billion, our free cash flow in 2016 was a little more than $4.1 billion and with $2.1 billion of share repurchases and $2 million of dividends paid, we returned a 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders last year.","On chart eight you can see how our consistent focus on returning cash to our stockholders have resulted in a significant reduction in number of shares outstanding. We reduced our shares outstanding by 36% from our peak share count level of 456 million shares in 2002 and we achieved our goal of reducing outstanding shares to below 291 million shares one year earlier than our target date. As a reminder, we anticipate $2 million of share repurchases in 2017.","Chart nine provides our 2017 outlook, our sales guidance is between $49.4 billion and $50.6 billion and our segment operating profit range is between $5.015 billion and $5.135 billion. Our FAS\/CAS adjustment is $880 million for 2017 and we will discuss this in more detail on the next chart. Our earnings per share are expected to be between $12.25 and $12.55 and our cash from operations is expected to be equal to or greater than $5.7 billion as we discussed earlier and this represents a good start to achieving the goal we established in October of generating $15 billion or more of cash from operations during 2017 to 2019.","On chart 10 we compare the FAS\/CAS adjustment outlook that we provided in October with what we are providing now. In October, we expected an adjustment of $800 million since then interest rates increased probably our discount rates to increase to the 4.125% level by year-end, 50 basis points higher than we projected in October.","The increase in discount rate increased our FAS\/CAS adjustment for 2017 by $240 million and we lowered our outlook for the long-term return on our pension assets from 8% to 7.5%, recognizing the downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset classes in our trust, lowering the long-term return on assets lowers our FAS\/CAS adjustment in 2017 by $160 million, partially offsetting the increase resulting from the higher discount rate and netting to a FAS\/CAS adjustment of $880 million for 2017.","Chart 11 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook ranges by the four business areas. I recall a briefing we gave in New York City at the end of 2006 where we said that the Aeronautics business area would grow from its $11 billion revenue level then to more than $20 billion by 2015. Given all that's happened since that time reaching $20 billion in 2017 still feels like a nice accomplishment for our Aeronautics team and has enabled us to forecast 2017 revenue of $50 billion at the midpoint of our guidance.","And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. We achieved exceptional performance in 2016. We continued our cash deployment practices and generated strong returns for our stockholders, and we completed our portfolio shaping actions, which we believe positions us for the continued long-term value creation.","With that, we are ready for your questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","Could you basically update us in terms of where you are in your negotiations on LRIP 10 and whether you intend to basically take any legal action in terms of the way the [inaudible] (27:07) of LRIP 9 was determined?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question Cai. I will take that on and Bruce do you have anything to add you\u2019re certainly welcome. On LRIP 10 we are very close to a deal as some of may have seen in the media I expressed that after my discussions with President Trump recently. We are very close to a deal that would allow us to close LRIP 10 in the near-term and so I expect that will be very soon. On LRIP 9, basically we are not under any pressure to do anything further on LRIP 9 at this point. We are just going to continue to look at our options on LRIP 9. Anything do you want to add Bruce?","Bruce Tanner","No, no. I think that capture it, Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ron Epstein","Yeah. Hey. Hey, good morning, guys.","Bruce Tanner","Hi.","Ron Epstein","When we perhaps think about modeling the program, the F-35 program as we go out over the next several years, I mean, one question I get a lot from investors is, I mean, how should we think about the margin profile? I guess what I am asking is one of the fears is on Lot 10 pricing, I mean, are we going to see a margin step-down or I mean, can you give us a broad way to think about the margin progression of that program?","Bruce Tanner","Hey, Ron, I will take a shot at that. So the way I think of it, Ron, we have given, I think, a very consistent speech for a number of years about our expectation that the F-35 program will have sort of sequential year-over-year margin improvement up to the point that probably we reach full rate production at which point it ought to look a lot like other production programs at that sort of thing stage of their lifecycle.","And at least as I look with the expectation of where I think the agreement on LRIP 10 is going to come out. I don't think we would deviate from that discussion at this point in time, just to put in some perspective, I think, if F-35 from 2016 to 2017 the margins that we are expecting in between those two years is probably growing 90 basis points not quite 100 basis points year-over-year. I think that\u2019s going to happen with the results that we expect to obtain on the LRIP 10 negotiation. And thereafter, I would expect that we would continue to have some margin improvement maybe not as at higher rate as we experienced from sub 2016 to 2017, but still have sequential increase in margin after the full rate production programs as we have talked about in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Rich Safran","Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning. I have a question on Brexit and international, so one fallout, potential fallout from Brexit is the impact on the U.K. defense spending. I was wondering if you have had any discussions with the British Government on this topic, if you expect much of an impact. And on the topic of international, can you give us an update on the discussions you are having with international customers, for example, how they are viewing the change in administration, are you expecting a continued step-up in international demand, is there any change in emphasis on direct versus FMS, that sort of thing?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for your question Rich. I will just start with Brexit question and in terms of U.K. defense spending, I haven't had any impact and input from the U.K. MOD that they're going to move off of their strategic defense plan, they have a strategy and their normal review that they will continue to spend on their defense spending. So we haven't seen any impact from that. No indication that that\u2019s going to change. I think just like most countries their national security is first and foremost for them and so they are going to continue to focus on that.","In terms of other international customers and any reaction to the change administration. I frankly haven\u2019t had any dialogue back from that as well. We -- as we bring in -- as we have an orderly transition of power in the United States of America, we have new leaders in the administration, they each -- they have different policies they might put forward, but it hasn\u2019t impacted our demand for our international products, a lot of our growth on international -- in the international marketplaces in the F-35, it\u2019s in missile defense, it\u2019s an opportunity for F-16 and C-130J, opportunities for C4ISR, Space awareness, things of that nature and that continue -- there continues to be a demand for those. And I -- as I -- as we continue to move forward in dealing with our international customers we\u2019re not seeing any retrenchment at all.","Bruce Tanner","Rich, you asked about the FMS and our direct commercial sale whether there was any discussions about potentially changing that are not. My suspicion is that\u2019s not high on anyone's agenda list at this point in time and I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any sort of policy changes towards that.","Just to put it in some perspective as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we would expect our FMS percentage of our international sales to grow and our direct commercial sale percentage of our international business to shrink over time, primarily simply because of the F-35 program and that program is a long way from ever having the ability to sell any aircraft on a direct commercial basis and essentially all the international customers and all the growth that you're going to see from international customers and the program going forward is going to be on the FMS side of the house.","And the same thing, frankly, is happening with our THAAD program, which is another large international grower. So that sort of squeezing out if you will the actual direct commercial sale business, actually direct commercial sales business isn\u2019t shrinking in absolute terms of all that much, but the percentage is reduced because of what I just described.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi Rob.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Marillyn and Bruce, your comments on the F-35 program essentially seemed to suggest that nothing is really changing. But in the press we seem to see the DOD and the President taking a more aggressive stance. Is there a chance you are being too optimistic on this and the actual pricing on Lot 10 and beyond, and the margin could be lower than you expect?","Marillyn Hewson","Let me take that on since I have been a lot of discussions with President Trump. I only just going to frame it for you, I tried to express after those meetings, some overview of the meetings themselves, but I\u2019ll just give you a little bit more color on it.","Basically President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, its largest program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure that that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible costs on the program and we share, we understand his concerns about affordability, we certainly share that. The meetings that we've had have been very productive, with very good dialogue. He asked excellent questions and he is really focused on making sure that that the cost comes down on the program and it is not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions about how we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future.","So I have welcome the opportunity to talk to him, because it gives me an opportunity to share with him what we have been doing in terms of bringing the cost down as you saw on the chart that we put in our deck today that we have been driving the cost down on the program that we have invested as ourselves and our industry partners in what\u2019s called blueprint for affordability and we're moving forward on sustainment cost reduction initiatives, so that we can continue to take cost out of the supply chain, to take cost out of our manufacturing and produce ability and materials we use as we\u2019ve moved along on this program.","And as we've done that we\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve also have the opportunity to share with him things that the Department of Defense can do and how they might buy the aircraft differently in the future that would help continue to drive the cost down, he open that discussion.","The other thing is very important that I'm happy to have the opportunity to chat with him about is the capabilities of the F-35 brings to our minimum and uniform, I mean, it\u2019s basically a game changer, it brings for our country, for our military, as well as for our allies around the world unmatched capability, absolutely unmatched.","And recognizing that his focus is on how do we drive the cost down aggressively and we -- I think we are -- us along with our industry partners are right in line with him on doing that, we\u2019ve got a lot of ideas on how we can do that in the future. In the meantime, we will continue on the current negotiations to come down that curve that you saw on the chart that we shared with you to continue to drive the cost down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Marillyn, just a follow-up to that last statement you made on the sustainment cost, are you talking about an incremental initiative here to reduce maybe some of the sustainment spending or is there may be an opposite way to think about that that as you manage this program for the next 10 years to 15 years for Lockheed that you can lower the unit cost, but perhaps, maybe recoup some of those upfront unit cost savings for DOD with actually higher sustainment revenues for you guys further down the road? How are you thinking about that balance?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, first of all, what I was discussing was the sustainment cost reduction initiatives, just like on blueprint for affordability which was focused on production costs, we along with Northrop Grumman and BAE committed some investment up front to help with getting projects underway that will continue to drive the cost down and production. We have similarly invested upfront to support the U.S. Government in driving sustainment costs down in the near-term over the next five years to drive that cost down.","So that was what I was referring to. Now your question about sustainment itself, I mean, we do look at these programs in terms of their overall lifecycle costs, which is not just the development and production but it\u2019s also sustainment and our goal is that the overall cost for the program would continue to come down.","Bruce Tanner","Hunter, maybe just to add one thing from my perspective and just to make sure that we are all clear on this. Sustainment is going to grow in the future. It has grown very significantly last few years as the aircraft is being based at various locations around the U.S. and soon to be internationally as well. So there is no doubt that sustainment will grow and the Lockheed Martin contribution towards that sustainment will grow into the future. This is about just doing sustainment smartly and doing it as economically as we can, but even if we do it is economically as we can we are still going to see some pretty significant sustainment growth in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","You just talk a little bit about the backlog being $96 billion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your expectations are for 2017 year-end backlog and maybe highlight some of the key orders you are looking at, there was some international THAAD that didn't happen in \u201816 and just if you can talk a little bit about some of the key orders to watch?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So, thanks, Sam, there is, as we look at 2017 in all likelihood we are probably going to see a little bit of degradation in backlog. I would think maybe a couple million bucks or so for the year. Some of that is obviously dependent on, there is a couple of fairly good size competitive awards in 2017 that may or may not happen or may or may, at least may or may not happen in the year and in fact we may or may not win some of the proposals if you will.","The biggest drivers we have got in terms of orders and sort of keeping the backlog level as to where it is today are a little bit less than where it is today. You should think of that the ongoing advanced funding for the F-35 program. So very early in the first half of this year we should start receiving advanced funding for the LRIP 12 aircraft which will be a pretty good size increase in terms of absolute numbers of aircraft over LRIP 11.","As we just talked about with Hunter the sustainment and spares funding to support the bases around the country and the global is going to be increased in the first half of the year. We should start seeing additional GPS III satellite orders first half of the year and probably finalize the Hellfire order that didn't quite get finished last year and I expect that will take place early this year.","The really big orders in the year are the LRIP 11, definitization for F-35 that's -- we are assuming in numbers that we are going to get both LRIP 10 negotiated and definitized and LRIP 11 negotiated and definitized in 2017. We have already recognized a pretty good portion of the LRIP 10 contract via the [ph] U.K. (41:30) that Marillyn talked about, but not so much on the LRIP 11, so a big, big chunk of our orders in 2017 is associated with that definitization.","You mentioned the international missile defense programs I believe the largest one we\u2019re looking and again the second half of year is the THAAD Qatar program, so the first five of THAAD battery for the Government of Qatar is also a fairly large order in the second half. And then lastly, and I believe this is actually the second largest order for the corporation in 2017, but we do expect to close on the multiyear nine Black Hawk order in the second half of this year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Marillyn, you\u2019ve gone through a number of significant changes in the last 12 months. And you indicated you and Bruce are going to be back to living a little bit more with normal. But could you for a moment step back and kind of talk a little bit about where are some of the competitive advantages you see and how you'd like to shape the company going forward, I mean, 25% of the company is F-35, but you do have a lot of other programs and a lot of other technology opportunities?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Howard. As I said in my prepared remarks on the front end, I think, we're extremely well-positioned for long-term success. Yes, last year was a challenging year in terms of transitioning the divestiture of IS&GS and really moving very far along in our integration with Sikorsky and that I would say a great tribute to the team is that despite those major efforts that we had going on in the business we exceeded all of our financial commitments, as well as actually hit some new records, I mean, I think, that's a true measure and our operational performance was outstanding in terms of how we are performing for our customer, so I'm extremely pleased with that.","In terms of strategically as we look forward, having Sikorsky as part of our company now, it opens up a lot of opportunities for us, we are currently in the development phase for a number of helicopter program, so we are going to move into production, so as you look at the CH-53K at the Presidential Helicopter, the work we've been doing on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter program, the combat rescue helicopter that we\u2019re working, all of those programs, as well as what Bruce mentioned, we continuing on with the Black Hawk and getting into the next year multiyear Black Hawk is excellent growth area for us that will continue to bring good cash generation and continued growth for us as the company.","And then we do expect at some point the commercial business will come back, we are at a lull right now with the oil and gas prices, but it\u2019s another opportunity for growth for us and one of the elements of the company that we\u2019ll look forward to continuing to grow. And so, Sikorsky has been a great asset that we brought into the company and I see great growth opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about 35 at length, you can see, certainly it is a growth engine for our company and we continue to see growing international demand for it, so it\u2019s not just a program of record that we have with the U.S. Government on the services that are buying the aircraft, but and the international partners that have already signed up, but many other countries are showing interest in the program.","And then across the portfolio from our missile defense to the work we are doing in mission systems and training to all the elements of our fire control capability, our space systems and satellite and spacecraft. I think if you look holistically at our portfolio we are very strong in all of those areas and represent a leader in and virtually every one of those markets. So from a competitive advantage standpoint I think our goal is to continue to perform with excellence on the programs that we have today and to continue to look for opportunities to keep our portfolio relevant to continue to invest in research and development and innovation so that we stay on the forefront.","I think innovation for us is the lifeline of this company. What we\u2019re doing in our independent research and development, what we\u2019re providing to our current customers and what we\u2019re looking at and providing for long-term investments for the long-term and things like hypersonic and directed energy and other things. And then as you're probably aware we set up a venture fund where we\u2019re also taking positions in companies that we see is another seeding of our innovation into our company.","I would lastly say that from a competitive advantage standpoint my view is that that it is the talent in this company that is the competitive advantage. We have the best talent in the industry in my view from and that in my view sets us apart. So that couple with the technology and the outstanding portfolio, I think, sets us up very well for continued success and continued growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Marillyn, it sounds like border taxation was discussed during your meeting yesterday with other business leaders and I'm just curious as it applies to your own business and to the defense landscape, do you have a sense as to -- a clear sense as to how this is going to impact your business in the sector, does it sound like the President is a supporter of no tax on exports and could you just describe how it would impact Lockheed the way you see it? Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Myles. And I guess, I would step back from his yesterday and what you\u2019ve heard from him in his campaign is that his focus is on not having work go offshore to be produced and then brought back into the United States that are -- and have the company have the advantage of producing it elsewhere. So if you take the Lockheed Martin, I mean, we are not, we produce our products in the U.S., predominantly of our roughly [ph] 98,000 (48:04) employees over 90,000 are here in the U.S. This is where we produce our products and then we deliver them around the world.","And those that are producing another parts of the world whether it\u2019s in the U.K. or in Canada or Australia, the work that we might be doing there is not being imported back into the U.S. So I don't see that this border taxation issue affects us as a company and I think it\u2019s more geared toward commercial companies that might decide to do the production offshore and then sell their products back into the U.S.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. May be Myles just to add it from my perspective, so anytime you're talking about reducing taxes on exports, we\u2019re -- we have a fairly good amount of exports and we don't frankly import a whole lot, so we would probably be a net benefiter from a tax perspective relative to that were to happen.","I think if you look at either one of the tax proposal as sort of being tossed around. The current one you just discussed, as well as the one that the house put forward later or earlier, excuse me, middle part of last year or so.","In virtually either one of those scenarios the statutory rate drops pretty significantly and for Lockheed Martin the U.S. domiciled company with most of our income, as Marilyn said, coming from U.S. locations. We don't have the sort of offshore issues that a lot of the global companies would and so we would be a benefiter or benefactor probably either one of those tax policies going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Marillyn, I wanted to ask if you could maybe provide a little more detail or I guess thought around the total U.S. defense budget commentary you touched on briefly in your prepared remarks. I mean, I guess, where would [ph] Japan (50:16) the actual likelihood that sequestration is removed from DOD versus the need to have some kind of compromise where they, I guess, still, I guess, I'm not as sure, but still seemingly still deficit focused Congress and if this is happening will we see it in the \u201818 request or does the administration need another year and half to have it be fully their own and be prepared to do that?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Noah. I guess, I will just give you my opinion because that's really all I can do at this point is pretty unpredictable as we go forward and as you indicated. My opinion is though that there's appears to be bipartisan support for eliminating sequestration. As I\u2019ve said in the past, we have a lot of independent dialogues with various members of Congress, every one I've ever spoken to [Technical Difficulty] they don't think it's good policy and they want to get rid of it.","So I think now with the current Congress and the new administration that it probably opens up the opportunity for really getting that done and I'm very encouraged that the dialogue has been around eliminating the defense sequester, just removing it altogether and there's also a strong discussion around increasing defense spending, because we have for the last few years allowed our -- with that budget caps et cetera, we have not been investing like we need to in recapitalization and then and readiness and a lot of things that you hit directly from our customers, our services telling Congress and telling the new administration that they need.","So we are very supportive of our defense customers and being a voice around that, because we do think it's important to eliminate the sequester and the budget caps associated with it to allow them to do, to address the national security strategies and to provide a right capability for minimum and uniform.","In terms of where it might come into play, I mean, I -- again, I'm encouraged by the fact that there is some discussions around supplemental to the FY17 budget, there's some discussions around getting after this whole issue of sequester and eliminating the budget caps. So whether it\u2019s in \u201918 request or in the early \u201917, it\u2019s hard for me to predict, but I think it will be near-term and longer term, because everyone that I speak to has recognized and certainly President Trump has recognized that it's something that needs to go away and we need to get on with spending the appropriate amount, having adequate budgets to support our national security.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky","Good morning, everyone. Bruce, Marillyn, I was wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor and walk through each of the segments and maybe provide a little bit of color on the risks and opportunities this year relative to your official outlook?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jason. Let -- Bruce why don\u2019t you walk through and then if I have anything to add on.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Let me do that and Jason, if I don\u2019t quite capture what you are looking for get back and shout out at me there. But maybe just starting with Aeronautics, largest business, obviously, portfolio. So on the sales side we\u2019re expecting sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, so fourth quarter will be the highest quarter of the year first quarter as is typical in Aeronautics will be the lowest quarter of the year.","From sort of the comparison to 2016, I would expect sort of the rate of growth or the percentage of growth over \u201816 to sort of diminish a little bit as we go through the year even though the numbers will get bigger and that's in part because we are going to see a little bit albeit the F-16 program comes to an end in the late second quarter or early third quarter, if this is the last eight aircraft deliveries that we have in backlog right now and until we get another country to buy the F-16 that will be the last those production aircraft, so that\u2019s going to be a little bit lower in the second half of the year than the first half, but still pretty significant growth quarter-over-quarter for Aeronautics and obviously most of that driven by the F-35 program.","I think EBIT during the year probably follows the sales volume as we look at least right now pretty consistent margins quarter-over-quarter, that obviously, it is dependent upon when we have the timing of risk retirements occurring throughout the year, but with the planned risk retirements we have in the outlook right now it says that the margins are fairly consistent going throughout the year.","May be jumping to missiles and fire control, expect the first quarter to be maybe a little bit lower than perhaps you're expecting, first quarter is going to be quite a bit lower than the rest of the other three quarters of the year, you should think of that as the timing of deliveries that had both and especially if you are comparing it to the fourth quarter of 2016 we had a lot more deliveries in the second half of 2016 and we expect to see in the first quarter of 2017, and so that drop off you'll notice I think when we come out with our results at the end of the first quarter.","The next three quarters are quite a bit higher than the fourth quarter and they are actually pretty consistent as we look at the outlook right here for the next year or so, low in the first quarter, next three much higher and the next three fairly consistent with each other.","Similar to Aeronautics, the EBIT kind of follows the sales volume because we do expect a fairly consistent margin between quarters in 2017. Rotary and Mission Systems 2017 kind of similar to Aeronautics, we do expect sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. Probably, also EBIT tracking for sales but we also expect that the margin quarter-over-quarter will increase, so we'll see some increases as we go throughout the year within the margins within RMS and this is a little bit of the wind down of some of the purchase accounting and intangible -- not intangible amortization but the integration costs associate with Sikorsky, as well as the timing of some of our planned risk retirements in 2017 causing that effect.","And then, lastly, Space, in 2017 actually almost draw straight line across the quarters, roughly $2.2 billion there about every single quarter of the year is what we are expecting. There's no commercial launches or commercial satellites with sales that we would book upon delivery like we had in 2016. We actually had two commercial launches all in the year and we have zero plan for this year, so you won\u2019t kind of see the spike associate with those deliveries as we saw in 2016 so I am a little more consistent there.","EBIT again kind of follow sales volume is probably little more variability than that and this is really associate with the timing of equity earnings as we progressed throughout the year. So hopefully that captures that in terms of how we look at that. Obviously, as we look at the year and I always give this speech at the start of, it\u2019s seems every year, that's based on the opportunities that are built into our plan.","And as I always like to say, as we look at the opportunities in 2017 and compare those to what we saw in 2016, the potential for doing better is about the same as what we saw in 2016 or for that matter in 2015 but we have to make that happen in 2017 for that to come to fruition and again that's not in the numbers or the planning that we just talked about to you.","Greg Gardner","Stephanie, I believe we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of cleanup things on F-35, Marillyn, if we go back to the sustainment discussion, in your discussion, in your negotiations with DOD on LRIP 10 and on anything else, has there been any consideration to defer future competition for either F-35 sustainment or for the Block 4 subsystem upgrade work? And Bruce, how is this potential competition contemplated in your long-term outlook for the aircraft? And then the last thing I wanted to ask you is how important is the 450 unit international block buy to the margin growth cadence that you described to Ron earlier?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Rob. I guess, the first question on sustainment, sustainment is a separate contract from the LRIP 10, so it isn\u2019t part of the discussion at all in LRIP 10 negotiations nor would be the upgrade work for Block 4 going forward\u2026","Robert Spingarn","But might they factor into any horse trading or anything that you all are talking about?","Marillyn Hewson","Actually no we treat them separately as separate contracts, we look at what the sustainment contract is versus the LRIP 10, I mean, there are just, the separate LRIP 10 is pretty straightforward, as we look at our assessment of the costs associated with LRIP 10 and offer that we put forward based on the cost of the aircraft and the terms and conditions associated with that contract. It doesn't include sustainment.","Bruce Tanner","Rob, let me try, I jotted down your questions. Hopefully, I captured them well. But as far as the future competition for sustainment block, if that happens and look competition is the buzzword that everyone talks about these days. We are not afraid of competition. We think the legacy of performance that we have both with the software development on the program, as well as what we've done so far in sustainment and we -- what we plan to do with as Marillyn said, some of the cost reduction initiatives on sustainment. We think we are incredibly well-positioned in both of those if in fact they are competed and our assumption would be that we would win those competitions and that is embedded in our planning if you will.","I think you also asked about the block buy and the importance of the 450 aircrafts, potential block buy relative to margins. Not so much benefit on the margins that we are contemplating, Rob, as much as helping secure long-term commitments from suppliers, long-term planning for our own work inside our own factory such that can hopefully get and with the benefits are sort of an economic order quantity associated with that block buy that we can get the price of the aircraft or the cost of the aircraft down just as what Marillyn\u2019s talked about relative to her conversations with the President. I mean that is one of the items that was addressed in those conversations is what can we and the government do to get the cost of the aircraft down and that is clearly one of the things that can do that.","You get -- if you look at any sort of multiyear or block buy or economic order quantity, there are always savings associated with that, the only question is how much are those savings and we think we have a very good plan in place relative to the block buy to bring the cost down going forward. But I wouldn\u2019t expect that that expectation on our part of lower cost would be sort of priced in to that block buy if you will. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see necessarily margin spike associate with that.","Marillyn Hewson","So with that -- with our last question let me conclude the call today. I want to end up the call by just reiterating that 2016 was truly an extraordinary year of transition and success, and our team performed exceptionally well in all phases, strategically, operationally and financially. As we look into 2017, our strong backlog and solid portfolio have the corporation positioned for bright future of topline growth and increasing cash flows. Thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking you at our next earnings call in April. Stephanie, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in our first quarter 2019 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had exceptionally strong results this quarter, financially, strategically and operationally. These results reflect the quality of our workforce, the strength of the corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. My thanks goes to everyone in the company for their contributions in driving this outstanding performance. This performance from across the corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2019 enable us to increase our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operation. ","Our first quarter results and increased full year outlook reflect the execution of our entire team as each of our 4 business areas were able to contribute to our improved financial outlook. Our backlog grew to a new record level, another sign of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of products and services. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail, but I would like to begin by highlighting a few of the elements that drove our exceptional performance. ","Sales this quarter exceeded last year's first quarter by 23%, with each business area growing revenue significantly from the first quarter of 2018. The growth was led by Missiles and Fire Control as deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, particularly in our Precision Fires organization, and our PAC-3 missiles grew from last year. Our Aeronautics business area also strong saw strong sales growth as we continue to increase production of our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and delivered 26 aircraft this quarter compared to 14 in last year's first quarter. ","Our segment operating profit increased by more than 30% year-over-year as strong performance across the board contributed to the growth. Missiles and Fire Control experienced outstanding operational performance over multiple programs, which allowed them to complete the retirement of risk items planned for later in the year. And similarly, in Space, our government satellites team producing the fifth and sixth spacecraft in the advanced extremely high frequency constellation was able to complete crucial testing milestones ahead of schedule as well as achieve program efficiencies to increase margins this quarter. These strong results in sales and earnings and our focus on maximizing cash returns also allowed us to increase our full year outlook for cash from operations. ","Our team continues to drive growth and performance in all financial metrics with a portfolio of products, technologies and services that are in great demand by our customers and continue to provide value to our stockholders. I'll touch on some significant performance milestones in just a moment, but I want to first highlight a few of the notable new business items that demonstrate the lasting importance and strength of our deep legacy portfolio. ","In Aeronautics, our F-16 team received 2 notifications from the State Department of the approvals for F-16 Foreign Military Sales to Morocco. The first is for a potential sale of 25 new F-16 Viper aircraft and related equipment with an estimated value of $3.8 billion. The second State Department approval will allow us to upgrade Morocco's existing 23 F-16 aircraft to the modernized Viper configuration. This opportunity has a total estimated value of nearly $1 billion and once definitized, Morocco will be the fifth international customer to upgrade its legacy F-16 fleet to this enhanced version of the Fighting Falcon. These notifications, coupled with the recent announcements from Bahrain, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Greece, on planned future new F-16 aircraft production and upgrades shows the enduring support of this venerable fourth-generation fighter. ","In Missiles and Fire Control, we received a contract award for over $1.1 billion from the U.S. Army for lot 14 of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System munitions and associated equipment. Demand for this program has increased significantly, both domestically and internationally, and we now anticipate that we will deliver nearly 5x the number of rockets and launcher pods this year than we did just two years ago. ","Rotary and Mission Systems saw a continued strong interest from several international customers this quarter. RMS received a $200 million award from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force for development and integration of the Aegis Weapon System on new Japanese ships. RMS has already delivered the Aegis Combat System to 4 of Japan's Kongo-class and 2 of their Atago-class destroyers, and we will now provide this capability for an additional 2 Atago ships, continuing a relationship that began over 30 years ago. ","RMS' Sikorsky line of business was awarded a contract from Poland to build 4 S-70is, our international BLACK HAWK helicopter variant, for the country's special operations forces missions. The award announced by the nation's prime minister at a signing ceremony inside the Sikorsky production center in southern Poland follows delivery of 2 S-70is to the Polish national police in November of last year and continues our 10 years of Sikorsky helicopter production in Poland. ","Keeping with Sikorsky, the State Department announced a potential $2.6 billion Foreign Military Sale to India for 24 MH-60R SEAHAWK helicopters. This Romeo version of the BLACK HAWK is the world's most advanced maritime helicopter, and this contract, once definitized, will allow us to deliver unparalleled anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface weapon capabilities to the government of India. ","And in our Space business area, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense awarded us a contract worth approximately $3.6 billion to oversee the operation of the MOD's atomic weapons establishment sites for another 3 years. We are honored to continue to support the U.K. government's important mission as part of the AWE Management Limited venture with our strong focus on security and safety. These announcements reflect the continued demand both domestically and internationally for our portfolio of products and services. Our legacy platforms remain vibrant, and our focus on innovation and new technologies provides us with growth opportunities for the future. ","Moving briefly to the defense budget. The president submitted the FY '20 presidential budget in March with a total defense request of $750 billion. Included in this request is $718 billion for DoD total funding, an increase of nearly 5% from the 2019 enacted appropriation level. The FY '20 submission continues to focus on missile defense, nuclear, space, cyber, joint lethality and intelligence capabilities in support of a national defense strategy, and we have demonstrated that our portfolio remains well aligned with these priorities. To achieve the funding objectives contained in the administration's request, Congress will ultimately need to pass legislation to raise the Budget Control Act ceiling, which are still in effect for discretionary defense spending in FY '20 and FY '21. ","We are encouraged by recent congressional support for raising the spending caps. However, we expect significant discussions to take place before the budget process will be finalized. We have seen strong bipartisan support for national security initiative and the recapitalization of our nation's armed forces over the past several budget cycles as well as for our programs in general, and we are hopeful the fiscal year '20 process results in a similar outcome. ","Moving on. I would like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program we saw several important milestones and accomplishments take place this quarter that spotlight the program's maturity and the continuing support we see from the international community. First, a truly significant event took place in February as a department of The Navy declared initial operational capability or IOC for its fleet of carrier-variant F-35, deeming the F-35Cs are ready for combat. ","Beginning with the U.S. Navy's receipt of its first F-35C test aircraft, the joint government and industry team embarked on a rigorous path to IOC, including participation by 2 carrier vessels, 3 squadrons, multiple sea trials and significant logistics and support effort, which resulted in 10 F-35C jets from the Strike Fighter squadron 147, the Argonauts, being declared ready for operations. Preparations can now begin for the first carrier deployment aboard the USS Carl Vinson, and this achievement will mark the first time in over half a century the U.S. Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force will all be mission-ready and combat-capable with the same family of fighter jets, a tremendous achievement for the entire F-35 team. ","Keeping with the Joint Strike Fighter. I was proud to attend the ceremony this January to celebrate the rollout of the first operational F-35A or conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, becoming the third overall plane to be delivered to the Dutch. The Netherlands has been an F-35 partner since the plane's inception and continues to be a strong advocate for the program. The first 2 CTOL aircraft were delivered in 2013, and we are concurrently supporting operational testing, and this latest addition to the Dutch fleet will ferry to Luke Air Force Base to be used in pilot training. The Netherlands Air Force, with its plan to acquire 37 jets and its role as a sustainment hub in the European region, is a key partner in the F-35 community, and we are honored to help support their national security objectives. ","Moving to Missiles and Fire Control. We are very pleased to see the first and second tranche of orders from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to procure our Terminal High Altitude Air Defense or THAAD air and missile defense system. In March, we received the initial order for over $900 million for initial tooling and front-end procurement items. And on April 1, just after our quarter closed, we were awarded second order for approximately $2.5 billion to supply interceptors and equipment to support KSA and U.S. government THAAD batteries. These orders are the most recent actions following the U.S., Saudi Arabia announcements in 2017 and support the beginning of the development and deployment of the 7 planned Kingdom of Saudi Arabia THAAD battery installations. ","In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team celebrated a key milestone with the first flight of the SB>1 DEFIANT helicopter, a revolutionary aircraft developed jointly by our Sikorsky organization and Boeing. The DEFIANT is designed to fly at twice the speed and with twice the range of conventional helicopters, taking advantage of our innovative X2 Technology and coaxial rotor blade design. The SB>1 is currently participating in the U.S. Army's joint multiple role technology demonstrator program, helping to find the requirements for medium-lift utility helicopters for the Army's Future Vertical Lift program. ","I'll close with our Space business area, which received an order for over $800 million from the U.S. Navy to design, develop, build and integrate technologies to support the flight test demonstration of a new hypersonic boost glide weapon system. Lockheed Martin Space was awarded the Navy's conventional prompt strike weapons contract and will provide flight articles and support equipment for the system's flight test. This order follows 3 previous awards the corporation has received on hypersonic weapons: the Tactical Boost Glide contract, the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon or Hacksaw program and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARROW program. These wins are being performed in 3 of our 4 business areas with a cumulative value of our hypersonic strike weapon awards now exceeding $2.5 billion across the corporation. Air and missile defense and hypersonic weapons are key priorities of the Department of Defense's national defense strategy and missile defense review, and we look forward to continuing to lead the development of these emerging technologies in support of the customers' missions. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Possenriede","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales and segment operating profit were both higher than our expectations for the quarter, which also drove additional cash. We returned over $900 million to our stockholders in the quarter, nearly 2\/3 through dividends and 1\/3 in share repurchases. We also achieved another quarter of record backlog totaling $133.5 billion. And based on the strong first quarter results, we have increased our outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the year. We had a tremendous start to the year, and we will discuss these metrics in more depth on the upcoming charts. ","On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the first quarter of this year with last year's first quarter results. I'll note for comparison purposes that each quarter of this year has 13 weeks in the accounting period while last year's first quarter had 12 weeks. This will reverse itself in the third quarter, which last year had 14 weeks in the accounting period. However, even without the extra week in the first quarter, our results well exceeded our expectations. Sales grew 23% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.3 billion while segment operating profit increased 31% over last year's level to $1.7 billion. ","On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for first quarter by business area as compared to last year's first quarter. All the business areas experienced double-digit growth. Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control experienced the highest growth in the quarter with 27% and 40%, respectively. Aeronautics sales growth was driven primarily by F-35 production and sustainment volume while Missiles and Fire Control was driven by multiple programs, including precision fires, PAC-3, THAAD and hypersonics. ","Rotary and Mission Systems had 17% growth with contributions from all lines of business. Space also had strong growth of 13% driven by government satellite programs and new starts, including next-gen OPIR. ","On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in first quarter 2019 versus our results in first quarter 2018. Segment operating profit was up considerably in the quarter compared with last year's results. Here, Missiles and Fire Control had the largest increase in operating profit, 60% higher than last year. This increase reflects volume related to the sales I just discussed and the timing of risk retirements across the tactical and integrated air and missile defense portfolios. ","Aeronautics grew its operating profit by 23% due to higher volume on F-33 -- F-35 production contracts and risk retirements. RMS grew operating profit by 22% due to higher volume on mission systems at Sikorsky and risk retirements at IWSS, and this was slightly offset by a reserve taken on a ground-based radar program. And Space also increased operating profit by 27% mainly due to risk retirements on AEHF and volume on government satellite programs. ","Turning to Chart 7. We'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.99 was 49% higher than our results last year driven by a few items: first, the higher segment operating profit that I just discussed. In addition, it reflects the benefit of a lower tax rate that includes additional tax deductions for the foreign-derived intangible income or FDII that we highlighted as an opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2018. I will talk more about this on a later slide. Lastly, a onetime noncash earnings benefit from a property sales that had previously occurred. ","Turning to Chart 8. We'll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting out our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $1.4 billion. We returned nearly 70% of our free cash flow to our stockholders in the quarter between share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned, we are increasing our full year cash from operations outlook from greater than or equal to $7.4 billion to greater than or equal to $7.5 billion now that we have greater visibility into the year and a quarter of strong performance. We are on track for our continued investment in the business through capital expenditures with $1.7 billion planned for the year, which, as usual, is proportionately higher in the second half of the year. For the full year, we are progressing toward our cash deployment goals. ","Chart 9 provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $1 billion based on higher expectations for all of our business areas for the rest of the year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $100 million due to higher sales volume across all 4 business areas. There is no change to our net FAS\/CAS adjustment. We are increasing earnings per share expectations by $0.90. I will provide more detail into this increase on the next chart. And for cash from operations, we are increasing our outlook by $100 million to greater than or equal to $7.5 billion. ","Chart 10 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.27 increase in our EPS. Updates to our revised estimated effective tax rate from approximately 17.5% to 15.5% for the year, along with miscellaneous items, drive a $0.50 addition in EPS. The property sale from a prior period that we've noted in our press release add $0.13, resulting in a total increase of $0.90 and a new EPS outlook of greater than $20, with a range of $20.05 to $20.35. ","On Chart 11, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. As I discussed on a prior chart, we increased our sales outlook in all of our business areas: an increase of $425 million in Missiles and Fire Control; $225 million in RMS; $200 million in Aeronautics; and in Space, $150 million, for a total increase of $1 billion above the outlook we provided on our last call. ","Chart 12 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. And consistent with our sales outlook, each business segment increased their operating profit for the year: Missiles and Fire Control by $40 million, $25 million each for RMS and Space and $10 million for Aeronautics, totaling to an increase of $100 million above last quarter's outlook. ","And finally, on Chart 13, we have our summary. We're off to a very good start in 2019 with strong financial performance across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in our current level of our backlog as well as our future growth prospects across the entire portfolio. And based on the results of the quarter, we increased our full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. ","And with that, we're ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First from the line of Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Even without the extra week, I think your sales growth was about 14%, the highest in 15 years by our records. And I wanted to drill down a bit, if I could, into MFC, which seems to be the growth leader, and that would -- may have had the easiest comp for the year in this first quarter. I think you're targeting 15% for the year, highest among the segments. So Marillyn, you and Ken called out a bunch of programs that are driving that strength. But there's -- some of these wins are very recent, probably aren't in there yet, like Saudi THAAD, and I think there's a bunch of opportunity coming up with the Army. There's a new PAC-3 interceptor, PrSM, the mobile medium-range missile, among others. How do we think about MFC's growth with all of that opportunity and what you recently won? How long -- how sustainable is this beyond this year?","Kenneth Possenriede","Rob, it's Ken. I'll take that. So interesting question, Rob. And the way I'd answer it is we've talked about our capital expenditures this year of $1.7 billion, which are up quite a bit from previous years, and we see that growth into the future, mainly next year. I'd say a good chunk of that increase is due to our capacity build at Missiles and Fire Control, and that's across the portfolio for the strike weapons business. And the key there is we've worked very closely with our customer set, in line with them when we were building out that capacity. So we see strong growth in Hellfire, in JASSM, in IAMD. And from a PAC-3 standpoint, we see strong growth. You mentioned THAAD Saudi. So you are correct, we just booked that order. So Marillyn mentioned we booked the front-end obsolescence piece of that. In the second quarter, we'll book the interceptors for Saudi plus the Lot 11 interceptors. In the third quarter, we should be booking -- second or third quarter, we should be booking the localization work for Saudi Arabia. And then out in the 2021 time period, we'll book the rest of the interceptors, as Marillyn mentioned, the 7 batteries. So at least in the next couple of years, we see strong growth continuing at Missiles and Fire Control.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Good morning and great quarter. Just to follow up maybe a little bit more on Missiles and Fire Control. We saw the strong profitability in the quarter. And when we look back in the period, kind of 2012, 2013, 2014, kind of seeing upper teens type margin from that business, and I think our understanding was always that the mix toward new programs was going to push that into the 14%, 15% range, more in accordance with your guide this year. But maybe if you could talk about the sustainability of the Q1 profitability and why we shouldn't think that, that margin is going to be significantly higher going forward.","Kenneth Possenriede","Seth, it's Ken. I'll take that. So if you look at the first quarter, we had a couple of things going. So we did have a lion's share of our profit step-ups, risk retirements occurring in the first quarter. But what also happened in the quarter, we looked at some of our risk retirements that were planned later in the year, and it actually did make sense for us to take those steps in the first quarter. So if you look across the portfolio, it's apparent to us -- based on the first quarter results, we did take our outlook up from a profit standpoint for PAC-3 and THAAD, and that is mainly driven by performance and volume. ","And looking at our tactical and strike missiles portfolio, some of that growth was for performance and volume, but some of it was mainly for volume. So if you think about some of the starts -- the new starts in that part of the portfolio, namely hypersonics, that is going to continue to grow over time. That will be dilutive to margins. And also, the classified program that we talked about in the past, we're starting to see some volume growth there, but that will be dilutive in the future. So we see for the rest of the year with Missiles and Fire Control being a little north of 13% margin, so not what we saw in the first quarter for the reasons I described.","Operator","And we'll go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Safran","Ken, I guess I would just like to follow up on those comments that you just made about margins and the bit of dilution I think you're seeing from the influx of new development programs. Now you did mention that it was going to be dilutive going forward, but I'm also wondering though if that's pointing to future growth and margin expansion. And are there other elements -- everybody looks at margins as sort of a surrogate for cash. Are there other elements of cash that gives you confidence going forward? And as always, if you're seeing this growth in -- with new programs, I'm wondering what that might imply for your long-term cash flow outlook.","Kenneth Possenriede","Thanks, Rich. Yes. So we have had a concerted effort on our working capital. And you did see some of the benefits of that this year, so we feel good about what we're doing to manage the balance sheet from a working capital standpoint. So we still feel good about where we're going in the future for next year and the year after, at, round numbers, about $7 billion each in 2020 and 2021. We're also working the international angle, and we should see some potential advanced payments in the future. And we do see some upside from a margin standpoint going forward.","Marillyn Hewson","Just to add to that, too, Ken. I mean as we see these development programs, as they go through their longer cycle and get into production, we'll see margin improvements.","Kenneth Possenriede","We'll see margin expansion as well. Thank you, Marillyn. Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Epstein","Marillyn, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about hypersonics and what is going on there for the company. I understand a lot of that is classified so you're limited in what you can say, but can you give us a broader feel about how that market's developing? And maybe more color on how it's developing for Lockheed.","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. Thanks for the question, Ron. I guess the first thing I would say is that we've been investing in hypersonics for many, many years. And as a result of that, I think that's why we're leading in this front end of being able to bring capability forward. In terms of how the market is developing, it's basically threat-driven. If you look at what was in the national defense strategy, what's in the missile defense review, what you're seeing, our near-peer competition with China and Russia, I mean it's clearly a growing need for us to be able to not only address hypersonics but counter hypersonics as well. And so we are investing in both of those areas. We're bringing capabilities forward in both of those areas. And as I expressed in my earlier remarks, it's across 3 of our 4 business areas. Of course, the fourth business area will be working on some of the communications elements of that as well. And so frankly, it's an important investment area for us for many years as a corporation. And as we collaborate across our business areas and across our corporation, I think we're bringing the best solutions forward to our customer.","Operator","And next, we go to Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Douglas Harned","I wanted to switch over to F-35. You're seeing good growth there, but when you look at where the 2020 budget is, it cuts numbers back to 78. But then on the other hand, you've got a letter from 103 house members wanting to raise that to 102. And then we've got the issues around the Turkey order and then maybe some risks around Italy and Canada. So what I'm trying to understand is when you look at the plan that you have for taking production rates up over the next few years, how important are these potential shifts up and down. How do you think through where this could end up on the high end or on the lower end when you plan?","Marillyn Hewson","So let me just start with that, and then, Ken, you can add on to my comments. I guess the first thing I would say, Doug, is that we are continuing to see increased opportunities for the F-35. There's strong international demand. Certainly, as the domestic demand with the U.S. services is strong, the Department of Defense has been very clear that they're going to stay on their full procurement plan for that jet. They don't have any intention to pull away from that at all, so we see that going forward. How they manage what they buy year-to-year, that's always been a challenge as they look at what their overall needs are relative to the budgets that they have to work with. ","So I think that's going to continue, but what we're really seeing is the list of interested countries is continuing to grow. And you probably heard the Admiral Winter who is the Program Executive Officer recently comment a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned Poland and Romania, which are among the others that we\u2019re well aware of having competitions and having expressed their interest in the program going forward. So it's -- there's continued interest. Even the existing partners are expanding their needs, say Japan, for example. We're seeing a lot of other countries continue. ","So it is a -- it's certainly an opportunity for us to address the growing demand. We frankly have great capacity on this program. We've got facilities that -- in place that we're going to be in position to produce over 180 aircraft a year. We're prepared to do that. And so we see a lot of opportunities beyond the current program of record, which is something like 3,300 aircraft already, and it's growing. So I don't see a concern about that. Well, certainly, the government -- the JPO will have to figure out what -- how they manage what aircraft they buy at what point in time as countries look at their procurement decisions or as things change amongst some of the partners that we have. But I think they're managing that risk quite well and the demand is very strong. Want to add to that, Ken?","Kenneth Possenriede","Yes. The only thing I'd say and it's just -- if you think about the countries you describe, Doug. Turkey, an important ally of ours at least today, is -- if I remember this right, in the block buy, it's 8 aircraft per lot. Right now, Canada is not even in those numbers. Italy is an important ally. We're hopeful that they do continue on the program, but in the grand scheme of things, not a material number of aircraft. I think the frustrating piece for us is the United States Air Force. And we'll continue working with our customer and with representatives in the government on what's the right path forward there, and we'll continue to drive the price of the airplane down. We see a path too on LRIP 14, which is -- will be ordered in 2020 and delivered in 2022, will be below $80 million an aircraft for the A variant. And we'll continue driving down sustainability cost to where we get to $15,000 a flight hour by 2025. We're confident about hitting those numbers.","Marillyn Hewson","I think it's $25,000.","Kenneth Possenriede","Sorry, $25,000, excuse me, by 2025.","Operator","And next, we go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Ken, on the F-35, you clearly raised the margin on that program. Can you tell us where -- which block and where we might be on that? And then on the $50 million charge of the ground-based radar that you alluded to, what was that? And have there been other charges on that program in the past?","Kenneth Possenriede","You bet. Yes, George, you're right. On F-35, we did raise margins. It was mainly on looking at LRIP 10, looking at block buy and on some of our sustainment programs. And going forward, we're looking at steps on some of our other production programs, including LRIP 11, and we'll see how we're doing from a performance standpoint. So you've got that right from an F-35 perspective. ","So on the radar program, that is out of our RMS business, and we've had some issues from a software verification standpoint and fixes, installation and checkout and integration and test efforts. No, this was not our first write-off on this program. Going forward though, we feel pretty good. And if you look at some of the things that we have to do, for the rest of this year, we'll be doing software verification. Integration and test completion will be done. We'll deliver a secondary array later this year, and that will ultimately get us to delivering our radar -- the radar by the end of 2020. So going forward, we feel good about where we are on this program.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","So DoD is increasingly using classified orders to buy equipment to enhance security. Can you give us a rough sense in terms of what percent of your revenues or your backlog is classified? And maybe any color you might be willing to offer regarding in what areas of your business do you have more classified programs?","Kenneth Possenriede","Cai, it's Ken. It will be hard for us to tell you how much of that's in our backlog. But you should think of -- based on who we are, it's across our portfolio. We have a strong presence in Space. We have a strong presence in Missiles and Fire Control. It goes without saying, ADP, our Skunk Works has a strong presence doing classified work. And frankly, it's growing, and it's an important piece of our portfolio.","Operator","Next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Ken, I wanted to just come back to the guide and the performance in 1Q. Obviously, a good start to the year. It seems like you're highlighting a good portion of the strength to be timing-related. Can you just talk a bit more about why that is? I mean it seems like you're maybe expecting just a lot lower growth in the back half of the year. Are you being conservative? Are you concerned about budget? Just some more color there to get comfortable with the path ahead.","Kenneth Possenriede","You bet. So yes, if you go around the business, and I'll talk to this as our surprise and not so much year-over-year, but looking at ARROW, strong performance mainly in F-35. And looking at the back half of the year, it warranted taking our guidance up mainly -- in Aeronautics mainly driven by F-35. But also, back to Cai's question, some of that growth we did see in ADP, in our classified growth, which is dilutive. So that's why we only took our profit up the $10 million, and we took our sales up to $100 million. What I would say is, just recently coming from Aeronautics and looking at F-35, on the whole, we have comfort about the guidance that we're providing on F-35 right now. There may be potentially some upside. We'll see that in the next couple of quarters, but right now, we feel pretty good about Aeronautics. ","I think I gave enough color on Missiles and Fire Control, and we do see strong growth there. But in the back half of the year, it is lower, and we'll address that as time goes on. From an RMS perspective, from a guidance standpoint, we did take our guidance up driven by -- mainly driven by radar programs. In some -- to some extent, Sikorsky, we are seeing stronger growth at Sikorsky. But I will note just based on helicopter deliveries this year on the BLACK HAWK and frankly, there are none for MH-60 this year or CH-53 this year, year-over-year, Sikorsky is still down in sales. And from a Space standpoint, beginning of the year, we saw them as flattish. We now see them growing roughly 2%, and that's in the new start for OPIR, GPS III and space missile defense. But as you said, more of it in the front end than in the back end, and we'll take a look at this again in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS Securities.","Myles Walton","In the back of the press release, from the risk section, I noticed you expanded the commentary around delays due to governmental policy, in particular congressional notification delays to Saudi and UAE for the first time. It's obviously not holding you back. Your sales and bookings look great. But I'm just curious, is that -- are you seeing it? Or are you anticipating it? And is it both for military sales as well as through a commercial sales process?","Kenneth Possenriede","Myles, I'll take that. It's Ken. So we're not seeing it today, so it probably would be more in the future. So pick C-130Js for Saudi Arabia. We've been in conversations with the Kingdom, frankly, probably over the last 2 years. They have a desire to buy 23 variants of the C-130J aircraft. It still has not been approved by the United States government, so we're still sorting that -- excuse me, it has been approved by the United States government, but we're still sorting out when that can happen. So I think it's more anticipatory than what we have seen in the past.","Marillyn Hewson","If I could just add on to that. I mean we did get congressional notification get through that some years ago. But to Ken's point, it's been a number of years ago, and they've only bought 2 of the 25 they were authorized for. So we're in discussions with them. But if you think about some of the risk of sanctions against some of the munitions or something along that line, I mean, we conform with the policies of the U.S. government. So any changes in quantity that they might purchase will line up with U.S. policy. But as Ken said, we currently have orders on the books, and we're looking to fill those orders, and we don't see any changes to that guidance right now. So it's just acknowledging to a stockholder that there is risk, but we're not seeing that risk materialize yet.","Operator","Next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","On the F-35, you mentioned how the aftermarket had contributed in the first quarter. I was wondering what your expectation might be for F-35 support revenues this year and what that program could grow to over time.","Kenneth Possenriede","Sure. Rob, it's Ken. I'll take that. So yes, we do see sustainments going to grow this year, and it'll grow double digits. I don't think there's any question about that. And I do believe, based on conversations with the customer, we will continue to see growth in our sustainment. We'll continue to stand up basis in order to support the needs of having available aircraft out there. You'll see spares and parts continue to grow. We've talked a lot about the modernization of F-35 program, so you'll start seeing aircraft that are in the field, that are deployed out in the field will start to be modernized. So yes, in the foreseeable future, we continue to see growth in the sustainment of the F-35 program from a sales standpoint.","Operator","And we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just broader picture, going back to the growth question, the expectation of 6% -- 6% to 8% top line growth for the year. You're still growing at impressive mid-teens rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter. How do we think about the multiyear outlook in terms of growth? And maybe what's changed? Are there any new program wins? Any international wins? Or is it a delta versus what you're seeing in outlays on the budget?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, Sheila, thank you for the question. Let me just start by outlining for you the key areas of growth that we see, and then Ken can give some more color to that. I mean, first of all, I already mentioned earlier about the growth on the F-35. We consider that as a true growth engine for us for the next -- for the foreseeable future. And in fact, if we just look at the international growth opportunities, half -- close to half of the orders over the next for 5 years are going to be in international marketplace. And as I mentioned, there are several more countries that are coming online that we didn't anticipate even when we looked at that a year ago. ","Air missile defense is a key growth core area for us with PAC-3, THAAD, with our Aegis Combat Systems, with what we're doing with MEADS in Germany on what's called TLVS. But that area is a growth for us. Sikorsky, we continue to see growth in the Sikorsky line of business. We've got a lot of development programs, of course, that we are working on, from the CH-53K to the combat rescue helicopter, to the presidential helicopter, to also the opportunity on Future Vertical Lift. So that's a big opportunity for us. ","There's resurgence in our F-16. We're not only selling new F-16s, we're upgrading F-16s, and we see more and more customers coming forward to purchase F-16s. And then there's a big potential opportunity in India. So as we look forward, there could be up to anywhere close to 400 opportunities on F-16s between those -- among those countries that we see today. So good growth there. And then, of course, we want to continue with our growth on C-130, so the multiyear C-130 as well as opportunities in the Middle East and other countries for the C-130. ","Our Space business and the areas of space situational awareness and areas like that, we'll continue to see growth and then our radar systems, a lot of our sensors and opportunities. And then Ken had gone a great length talking to you a little bit about what we're doing in the Missiles and Fire Control. The real key is, if you look at our backlog, a record backlog of over $130 billion. I mean that sets us up well -- just that alone, what we've already booked in the business sets us up very well for the next few years. And then it should give you great confidence in that growth for that and then the opportunities we're seeing that aren't even yet in that backlog. Ken?","Kenneth Possenriede","You hit every point I was going to make, so thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","I'm going to follow on that because the bookings and the revenue projections both from you and the consensus don't -- are pretty far from squaring up. So 2017 book-to-bill, 1.2; 2018, 1.45; the quarter, 1.2. I think you've said the second quarter of this year would be your strongest of the year. I think you've said a lot of the 2018 booking strength isn't actually falling in 2019, and the bookings are very predictive of the revenue historically in the business. Why -- what am I missing in not believing the guidance that has the top line organic revenue growth rate decelerating to 5% to 6% the rest of the year; the consensus 2020\/2021, 5% to 6%? Why shouldn't it look a lot more like the first quarter, obviously ex the week, but in the double digits, which looks a lot more like the booking strength has been for a while here?","Kenneth Possenriede","Yes. No. It's Ken. I'll take that. So if you go back to last year, so our bookings last year were almost $79 billion. Think about the block buy of $23 billion of bookings last year, the omnibus work that we got for 36 aircraft, the economic order quantity bookings we got. So they're all -- that's great they're all in backlog. The issue is from a capacity standpoint, from where we are with the F-35, a lot of those orders were not just LRIP 12, but for LRIP 13 and 14 and then the front end of procurement for those orders. And it's going to take us a while to have that convert to cost and to sales. And the same thing -- for the second quarter, we're going to hopefully get the block buy definitization in the second quarter, which will be a sizable order in this quarter. But from a sales standpoint, that's not going to happen for the next couple of years.","Marillyn Hewson","And as we highlighted in my remarks, Ken, just to add to that, we did book the 3-year award on AWE, which typically, in the past, we haven't been doing those at a 3-year tranche. So that was a good solid unexpected award to get 3 years under our belt in the first quarter as well.","Kenneth Possenriede","Right.","Operator","Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","I'd like to discuss the Orion program for a minute. It feels like this human space exploration initiative has had a lot of starts and stops over the last 15 years or so. And you guys have noticed some top line strength there now for two quarters in a row. The question is what is the proving point on this program where it kind of becomes too hard to cancel ahead of the next period of budget pressure?","Marillyn Hewson","I'll give you a top-level story on that and then let -- Ken, if you have some additional to add to it. But I mean, if you look at the focus that this administration has on being leading in space, it has become a much more -- not only the exploration side, which is what Orion is focused on, but from a contested domain in terms of challenges that we see from our adversaries in space, over 70 countries have things up there in space. We've got space pads. We've got all of the satellites on the national security side that we're doing, the weather satellites. We have a range of capability across our Space business. Then when you look at the exploration side, there is a big desire for us to get to the moon and beyond. And Orion is the next spacecraft that will take astronauts to the moon and beyond -- to Mars and beyond. I mean that's our -- that's what we've been investing in, what the U.S. government's been investing in. It's held up well budget after budget because there's a strong bipartisan support for investing in that exploration opportunity. And couple that with a lot that you have heard from the administration and from NASA on where we want to go in space exploration, there's strong momentum behind it. So I think that's going to continue.","Kenneth Possenriede","Yes. I think the only other thing I'd add is just think where Orion is from an exploratory mission 1 and 2. If you look at exploratory mission 1, the crew module's complete. They're moving into testing. They're going to make the crew and the service modules soon. They're going to -- in the summer, that's going to get transported to NASA's Plum Brook Station, which is in Ohio for integrated environmental testing, and the launch on the SLS is driven for 2020. And EM-2, the exploratory mission two is right behind it in 2022. So there is enough momentum on this program that it's alive and well and well thought of.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","Marillyn and Ken, sort of bigger-picture question here in terms of execution and investing. Clearly, there's big growth and a lot of opportunities to come. So sort of part A is how are you executing on this big growth and aligning incentives just as you encounter some charges here and there? And then also, how are you investing at the opportunities? Specifically, how do you choose between what opportunities you pursue and which opportunities you do not pursue?","Marillyn Hewson","That's a great question, Jon, and it is a focus that we always have on performance and execution as a company. And I would say, just looking holistically, we're performing extremely well. I mean we do track very closely our performance in support of our customers on our programs on a regular basis, and we set a high bar obviously, even tighter requirements on our cost, schedule, quality, technical performance than even our customers do so that we get early warnings if things are going on track or whatever. And so we're performing well. ","We also keep a very strong focus on our suppliers because our suppliers play a key role in our overall performance. Somewhere between 60% to 70% of our revenue is in the supply base, so we rely heavily on those enterprises to perform in what they're doing as well. And we've got a strong subcontract management team that is working closely with them to make sure that they meet their commitments on performance so that we likewise will meet our commitment. ","Now on occasion, yes, we do have issues. When you're in a business like ours where you've got a portfolio of programs that are well into production, performing well, but you have new starts, very complex high-technology work that we do as a technology company start-up, there are times where we will have challenges not just in the development and complexity of the product but also in the supply base in support of that. We work through those. We put -- we have well-oiled processes in our company with program-assist teams and others that go in and work very closely at the front end of programs to address that. ","In terms of alignment of incentives, I mean, absolutely, our performance is aligned -- our performance is key to us performing and achieving incentives for our teams. So I think all of that is well lined up. It's long-standing processes that we have in the company. I think that's why you see that -- across the board that we performed well as a company, and we meet our commitments. Again, we're not perfect. We have issues that arise. But when there are issues, we address them, we put the right resources around it to go address them, and we never walk away from our customer on issues when we have them. ","The second point on investing, we do look where our priorities ought to be, and it comes with first aligning with the priorities of our customers. So we are constantly working closely with understanding where they're focused. If it's -- whether it's hypersonics, directed energy, whether it's what they need in advanced aircraft where they're looking at sensors and, as I mentioned, the space domain, all of those areas, we are in constant contact with our customers, understanding their priorities and aligning with our priorities. And if you look at our portfolio, how well it's been supported in the Department of Defense budget, in the government budgets that we have in the U.S. as well as our growth in our international marketplace of how we performed well in the international market with somewhere around 28% to 29% of our revenue is outside of the U.S. and then the absolute value of that is growing, I think we're well aligned in investing on the right things so that we can bring our best solutions to our customers.","Greg Gardner","John, this is Greg. I think we've come about the top of the hour here. So I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Well, thank you, Greg.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our second quarter results and our increased outlook for 2017. As today's release illustrates, we had strong results this quarter, operationally and financially. Our strong year to date financial performance also enabled us to increase our full year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across our businesses in providing critical products and services to our customers while returning outstanding value to stockholders. It is particularly noteworthy that our quarterly cash flows exceeded last year's second quarter by nearly $200 million when we adjust for the $125 million of IS&GS cash that was included in the 2016 results. ","Our team continues to progress toward our full year objective in growth in sales, EPS, and cash from operations, and I thank our team for their dedication to our mission. Chris will cover the financial results in detail a little later. However, I want to touch on two events which occurred after our accounting quarter closed that point to the strength of our portfolio and the significant growth opportunities they provide. First, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky line of business secured a $3.8 billion, five year contract for 257 Black Hawk helicopters to be delivered to the US Army, as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. This award marks Sikorsky\u2019s ninth multiple year contract with the US government and includes options for an additional 103 aircraft, bringing the potential value to over $5 billion. We are honored to have the opportunity to continue providing rotary aircraft in support of the important missions of the US Army and our international customer. ","Second, our Aeronautics business area received an F-35 award on LRIP 11, which includes funding for 74 US jets and totaled nearly $5.6 billion. This brings the total quantity of US aircraft authorized for LRIP 11 to 91 planes, a growth of 36 fighter jets from LRIP 10 US government order, and represents a 65% increase from the prior lot. We anticipate a separate order - a separate award later this quarter, which will add additional aircraft for our international F-35 partners and foreign military sales customers. The recent US award demonstrates continued evidence of the strong support the F-35 has earned, and we look forward to finalizing these contracts as we progress to full rate production. ","Turning briefly to Defense budgets, the FY17 DOD budget appropriations have been enacted and were consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement of 2015, bringing Defense Department base budget funding to approximately $524 billion, as well as overseas contingency operations funding to about $83 billion. We\u2019re pleased to see that our programs continue to be well supported, as seen by the legislation increasing F-35 aircraft and Black Hawk helicopter quantities. The higher levels for both the base and OCO budgets, reflect a growing level of bipartisan recognition of rising global security threats and the need for additional budget resources. The additional funding for FY17 will help begin to address some of the acute budget needs to recapitalize our defense assets and respond to the global security environment. ","Also, the president released his request for the FY18 DOD budget. This included $574 billion for the base budget, an increase of nearly 10% from the FY17 appropriations and 3% from the prior presidential base budget submission. Additionally, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, have released their fiscal year \u201918 National Defense Authorization Act markups, both of which greatly exceeded the president's request. And the House has since passed their version by a wide margin. While we recognize - while we realize that these proposals exceed the current budget caps, we are encouraged to see the recognition that our defense budgets require increased levels of funding. We are hopeful that bipartisan agreement can be reached to rescind or modify the budget caps and fund our military at the levels needed to address the current set of world threats. ","Moving on, I'd like to highlight several operational successes we achieved on our F-35 program, and then briefly comment on the recent historic announcements from the US and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia governments to bolster global security. The program featured two milestones that highlight the growing international nature of the Joint Strike Fighter. The first Japanese assembled F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, was unveiled at the Final Assembly and Checkout or FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan. This aircraft marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location. ","Similarly, the first F-35B variant to be assembled outside the United States, was rolled out in Italy from the Cameri FACO facility. Cameri has already delivered multiple F-35A versions and is slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total. Together, these two events underscore the benefits of the multinational partnerships that have been forged as we work to provide fifth generation capabilities to both US and coalition forces. ","Keeping with the F-35 program, we were also proud to spotlight our F-35A at the Paris Air Show last month. The CTOL variant performed its inaugural aerial demonstration, showcasing its aerobatic maneuvering and the jet\u2019s raw power to climb and run. I watched, along with the rest of the amazed crowd, at the Le Bourget Airport as the aircraft flawlessly executed 90 degree climbs, remarkable angle of attack displays, and several unique moves that only a fifth generation fighter could accomplish, all of which shine a bright light on the impressive capabilities this unrivaled stealth fighter provides. As the crowd erupted into applause, I could not have been more proud of what our Lockheed Martin team, together with the US government, the JPO organization, international partners, industry teammates, and hundreds of suppliers have been able to accomplish. ","Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words about the unprecedented announcements that President Trump and his majesty King Salman of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made in Riyadh in May. As part of those announcements, the kingdom expressed its intent to procure more than $28 billion worth of Lockheed Martin products and services, including air and missile defense products such as THAAD batteries and PAC-3 missiles, Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships, variants of our Littoral Combat Ship, C-130J aircraft and various other defense related capabilities and solutions. These announcements reflect the strength of the relationship that our corporation has built with the kingdom over the past 50 years. In addition, the request touched each of our four business areas, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our offerings and the growth potential that our portfolio brings.","Finally, I would like to acknowledge our Space Systems team, as they mark the one year anniversary of the Juno spacecraft orbiting the planet Jupiter. Images from the Juno orbiter graced the cover of the May issue of Science Magazine, delivering breathtaking views of the giant planet\u2019s polar region. The mission also included measurements of the magnetic and gravitational fields and unique perspectives on the atmospheric and weather environments of Jupiter's surface. Scientists are excited at the initial in depth results being provided, as well as with the potential new discoveries that may be made in the upcoming experiments. We believe our continuous commitment to innovation and our long term partnership with NASA have contributed to these remarkable achievements and we are proud to be a part of this ambitious undertaking. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your question. ","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn and good morning everyone. I'll be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s begin with chart three and an overview of our results. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in the quarter. Sales of $12.7 billion were slightly ahead of our expectations and showed solid growth over last year's results. Our operating profit and earnings per share results were also ahead of our expectations, while cash from operations was in line with what we were expecting. We continued our strong cash deployment actions and we increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. So we had a very solid second quarter and a nice rebound from some of the performance issues we had in the first quarter. ","On chart four we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were $1.1 billion higher this quarter compared with the last year, with most of that growth coming from the Aeronautics and Space Systems business areas. Aeronautics growth was driven by higher volume from the F-35 and C-130 programs, and an additional C-5 delivery this quarter compared with last year. Space Systems growth was driven by the inclusion of the atomic weapons establishment sales in the quarter compared with none in the second quarter of last year. Segment operating profit was $55 million higher this quarter compared to last year. This was driven by higher volume and improved performance of the F-35 program and Aeronautics, improved performance across multiple lines of business within RMS, and these were partially offset by lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance and Space Systems. ","Turning to chart five, we\u2019ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations of $3.23, was about 10% higher than the results from a year ago, reflecting both higher operating earnings and lower share count this year compared with last year. ","On chart six we'll compare our cash from operations this quarter versus our results from 2016. We generated more than $1.5 billion of cash in the quarter, over $70 million more than we did in the second quarter of last year. But as Marillyn said in her remarks, that understates our relative performance as last year's results included around $125 million of cash generated by IS&GS, which was not divested until August of last year. On a year to date basis, our $3.2 billion of cash generated, is also about $70 million higher than our results from the first half of 2016, but last year's amount included nearly $300 million of cash generated by IS&GS. ","Chart seven shows the cash returns to stockholders in the quarter. Subtracting capital expenditures in the quarter from our cash from operations, our free cash flow was just under $1.3 billion, and we returned slightly more than $1 billion to stockholders, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. This cash deployment represents 81% of our free cash flow in the quarter. ","On chart eight, we want to make you aware of two large awards that took place shortly after the end of the quarter that are not reflected in our reported backlog level. The largest award was for the F-35 LRIP 11 UCA for domestic aircraft that Marillyn mentioned and was worth $5.6 billion. The second award was for the multi-year IX by Black Hawk helicopters and was worth $3.8 billion. Both of these awards occurred within two weeks after the quarter close and their combined values would have pushed our backlog above $100 billion for the quarter had they occurred just a few days earlier. ","Chart nine provides our updated outlook for the year. We increased sales by $300 million, with all of that increase coming from the Space Systems business due to the higher volume we're seeing this year. We increased segment operating profit by $35 million, with $20 million of the increase coming from our Aeronautics business and $15 from Space Systems. Aeronautics increase recognizes better than planned performance so far this year, while the Space Systems increase is primarily volume driven. We had an improvement in our unallocated costs worth $25 million, driven mostly by a reduction to a previously established reserve. While these improvements in our - with these improvements in our operating profit, we increased our earnings per share by $0.15. And lastly, we\u2019re maintaining our cash from operations outlook at equal to or greater than $6 billion. ","Charts 10 and 11 show our revised outlooks by business area for both sales and segment operating profit. I covered the revisions in the outlook in the prior discussions. ","Chart 12 provides a reconciliation of our prior EPS outlook to our current outlook. The $35 million increase in segment operating profit, increases our expected EPS by about $0.10, while the $25 million decrease in unallocated expense, improves the EPS by around $0.05, resulting in a revised outlook for the year of $12.30 to $12.60. This new range is higher than the guidance we provided when we began this year, more than offsetting the setbacks we experienced in the first quarter. ","Finally, we have our summary on chart 13. Our quarter results for sales, profit, EPS and cash from operation, were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. That resulted in the increased outlook that we just discussed. We are well positioned to achieve our full year goals and as we look ahead to the third quarter earnings call, we'll provide our initial trend information for 2018. As a reminder, the new revenue recognition rule will be effective for us starting in January and will be incorporated into our trend information.","With that, we're ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]. First, we go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. Bruce, always a lot of focus on the cash flow, and there's been a lot of discussion about the capital spending at various defense contracts. Your CapEx is certainly up over the last few years, and up year-over-year. How should we think about that in future years? And what's going to dictate that? Is this F-35 volume or the contract wins or losses like TX? What\u2019s going to dictate kind of the levels of CapEx we see over the next few years?","Bruce Tanner","Sam, thanks for that question. It\u2019s a good question. As we looked at our long range planning from last year, that covers basically 2017, \u201918, and \u201919, 2017 is sort of a peak in terms of the capital expenditures for the corporation. And that reflects a number of things, some restructuring that we're doing within our Space Systems business, moving some of the work around within locations, within Space Systems, and it also reflects the last tranche of investments required to get the F-35 sort of fully capitalized. It increased in, I\u2019ll say between 2015 and maybe years prior to going forward because we added Sikorsky into the portfolio, which obviously has higher capital expenditure requirements than did the IS&GS business, which really had practically immaterial capital expenditure requirements. So if you start to sort of think of 2017 as sort being the high point, at least as we look at it today, going forward we would expect that number to slightly decrease going forward and within that slight decrease going forward, there are some requirements for additional new capital for some of the wins, one of which you described in your question, but that's sort of more than offset by the reductions in the other capital expenditures required, including F-35.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone. Bruce, how should we think about Aeronautics' organic revenue growth in 2018? Just because now you are going to have a pretty tough just growth comparison. You\u2019ll have more F-35 growth, but you had mentioned before other aircraft in the segment being headwinds, not sure if those have moved around. And then if you could just perhaps tie that into - a few quarters ago, you talked about staying in the 3% to 5% total Company growth range, but 2018 maybe being at the low end of that. Just wanted to check back in if that was still sort of the case. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Noah. So Aero\u2019s organic growth, I think what I said previously or what you said that I said previously in earlier quarters, still is true today. We're still looking - I\u2019ll probably answer your second question first. We're still looking at the total company, about the 3% to 5% growth going forward, and\u201918 is a little less than that and actually in \u201919, as we sit here today, it probably picks back up. And a lot of that is because as - to your first question, in 2018, we're actually seeing a drop off because we have the end of the F-16 production line, at least based on current orders at the end of our - close to the end of 2017. We have no new production F-16s planned for 2018 as we sit here today, and that's not in the numbers that we've talked about previously. We also have the end of the C-5 program in the early part of 2018, and so those two events are kind of bringing down Aeronautics organic growth. You\u2019re still seeing tremendous growth potential in both the production and sustainment programs for Aeronautics for the F-35 program, but the other two are slightly, as I said, dissipating some of that growth. And that's one of the reasons why in 2019 we kind of bounce back as we're operating off of a lower compare, if you will, in 2018. ","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. I want to change a little bit from operations, talk strategy for a moment, and there's two things related. One, Marillyn, you've started to make some investments outside of your core that look like they are complementary, and maybe you could address that and talk about how significant a commitment it could be. And then related to that is, from a longer-term point of view, you have to think about people and what are going on there, and how do you think about succession planning?","Marillyn Hewson","Excellent questions, Howard. Things that I - both of which I have spent a lot of time on, on a regular basis. So thank you for the question. From the strategy standpoint, our focus is on growth. We've been very clear about that. We think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow. We see our international growth increasing from what today is about 20 - in 2016 was about 27% of our sales, 30% and we\u2019ll continue to see that growth. The demand around the world is high for not only F-35, but missile defense. One of our F-16 C-130s, other defensive systems that we have, as well as our opportunities in space based situational awareness, et cetera. So that growth, we have been - in terms of your comment about outside our core, the complementary, I would say that our commercial satellites, our commercial helicopters, those that we\u2019re doing with the LM-100J, which is the commercial version of the C-130, those are absolutely areas to move in commercial but very closely aligned. And then of course the hybrid airship is another opportunity for us. So those all are in line with our core competences and our capabilities, but moving into similar - more into the commercial space and aligning with that.","Long term, we're always focused on our talent management, our talent development. It is an ongoing part of our business. And in terms of succession planning, as you look at the leadership team that we have at Lockheed Martin, very seasoned, very strong, talented team that is - that I'm really proud to be a part of the team and working collectively with them on how we\u2019re executing our strategy for the corporation. But at all times we\u2019re looking at building that pipeline of talent into the business. And yes, we also look at that talent from the standpoint of its diversity. And so I'm proud to say that 21% of our leaders are women and we continue to bring more talent in from that regard. So succession planning is something that we continue to look at as a company and it's an ongoing effort for us. Thanks for the question. ","Operator","And next we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Good morning. I wanted to ask, as you go into next year, and we think about - going back to the cash flow, Sam asked about the CapEx. And you talked I think at the tail end of last quarter, about trying to - ex-pension contribution, perhaps cash flow could be - operating cash flow could be flattish with this year. Bruce, does that still work with the multi-year on the Black Hawk and the quantity adjustments that are happening there? And any other new incremental information that we have since last time? ","Bruce Tanner","I think the answer is no. it doesn't change, Rob as far as our thinking is concerned relative to the way you've described 2018. Sans pension contribution, I would expect operating cash flow for the corporation to look pretty similar to this year. And again we talked about, after those pension contributions both in 2018 and 2019, but if you add the cash from those years along with 2017, we expect to be in excess of $15 billion. We're off to a great start obviously this year in 2017 and we\u2019ll give you more insight into what we're looking for \u201918 and maybe a little beyond as we talk to you on the next quarter call. ","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Good morning guys. I just want to maybe talk about some business opportunities, the first of which would be the TX and JSTARS. How's that going and when would you expect a decision made on those?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. I\u2019ll take those. We\u2019re looking at where the Air Force is and TX and JSTARS, they\u2019re looking at - they\u2019ve set an award in the fourth quarter of this year. Obviously we never know until they actually do it, and so we couldn't say, but that's what they've outlined is the fourth quarter of 2017 for JSTARS and TX. And then we see some other near term awards that we're hoping to see in September, October timeframe, ones like the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services that we\u2019re unencumbered on that today and us being - it\u2019s in competition and we hope to see that award. It\u2019s got total program value with options of up to $8 billion. Our Ground Based Strategic Defense is another one that we would look to have to see an award coming here in the fourth quarter. And we're hoping as we look at the Saudi operations, the opportunity that we have there that potentially we could see a fat award sometime late in the year, early next year. ","And then another would be LRSO, the Long-Range Standoff Missile. That is also looking at September timeframe. And let\u2019s see. Another would be, the Saudis are looking at getting the search and rescue and S70i helicopter award that we expect in September timeframe as well. So several awards in the near term. I think I rattled off six or seven of them just there. And so we're excited. And Bruce, you have some other thoughts?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Just maybe one to address the question of the star - the start of your question, Ron. You should think of most of these as we've already submitted the proposals. So you sort of ask, what's the status? Well, the status is I think we're all sort of waiting and for the most part, the government is evaluating ours along with everyone else's proposal, and we sit anxiously waiting to see the results of that. but there's not much we can do at this point as I said because almost every one of the ones that Marillyn - if not all of them, that Marillyn just rattled off for - we've already submitted the proposals for those. ","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Finbar Sheehy","Hi. It's Finbar Sheehy for Doug. In your press release, you talked about higher sustainment activities in the quarter for the F-35. Can you talk to us about how big those are now, relative to total F-35 revenues and how you expect that's going to evolve over the next few years? Maybe how big a percentage of F-35 revenues will sustainment be, say, by the end of the decade? And how do margins on sustainment compare to the incremental margins you are getting now on new aircraft?","Bruce Tanner","I\u2019ll trying that, Finbar. So sustainment is growing fairly rapidly. I mean I want to say it's not quite growing this year at the same pace as is production, but it's growing dramatically over last year's numbers. I mean you should think of this as in the sort of high teens sorts of numbers. So it's growing incrementally and it'll continue to do that for a number of years as we set up more and more bases, both around the United States, but as well internationally as international customer start letting down the aircraft in their home location. So that growth is going to continue. I don't have the exact split, but I want to say if you look at sustainment out of the total F-35 production, I want to say it's probably 20%, 25% as large as the production volume on an annual basis, something like that. And it stays at those sorts of levels for the next few years. So as production grows over the next couple of years to its peak when we hit full rate production, I would expect that the sustainment will sort of follow suit there. ","And then your last question, Finbar, was relative to the margins and how we do on sustainment contracts. And I\u2019ll tell you, we do about the same on the F-35 sustainment as we do on production. That might change somewhat in the future going forward, but at least historically and where we sit today, they're pretty comfortable without a whole lot of difference between them. ","Operator","Next we go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask about the SAR that came out last week and the change in peak quantity of the Air Force buy in the out years. It came down from 80 to 60, but we're talking about numbers that are pretty far out there in 2022, 2023 time frame. So I'm wondering how you are looking at that, what implications you think it might have, whether it's a change that you expect to stick around. ","Marillyn Hewson","I\u2019ll take that, Seth. Thanks for the question. I would just say first off, we haven't really seen the SAR. I mean we know that it's been submitted to Congress. We know there's been top level readout from the JPO, but the fact sheet that came out on it. And I think in that, the Joint Program Office highlighted the fact that the reason that the numbers were changing were predominantly due to a change in the procurement profile of the Air Force jets, which is the largest volume buyer for the Air Force. And - but frankly, we just - I know that in my discussions with the Air Force, there's a desire to buy as many as they can, as quickly as they can. So I haven't got an official position from them that they\u2019ve reduce their procurement profile. That just happens to be what's in that select acquisition report that came out going. I mean certainly lots of opportunity to change the quantities as you can see just with what's in the budget deliberations right now, the adds that are coming forward on the F-35 for the various services. We think it's still in - we\u2019ll still see potentially some upside on it. So that would be my take. Bruce, anything you want to add?","Bruce Tanner","Another thing I might offer just for a little perspective. I think you had it right, Seth in that the planned peak volumes for the USAF are sort of far out there right now. Just to give you some perspective on that, we're still in discussions with the Joint Program Office relative to a potential block buy. And the numbers that have been thrown out for that block buy, and this is just again to put some perspective over three LRIPs, is about 400 and - between 440 and think of it as five - 450 or so aircraft over that three year LRIP period. So nearly 150 aircraft per year and that's what we're talking about for LRIPs 12, 13 and 14. So these are literally right around the corner. That\u2019s 150 aircraft, with the USAF buying 48 aircraft in each of those three fiscal years. So the cut to 80, to 60, we're not even approaching the 60 yet, and we're building aircraft of quantities of 150 per fiscal year. ","So as Marillyn said, a lot of opportunities to change quantities between now and then. And it will be interesting, once we do see the full SAR report, how much of that was sort of budgetarily really driven, with the potential to change that budget that much that further - that far out, excuse me, versus I\u2019ll say a quantity difference. And if I read the fact sheet right actually from the JPO, I think the actual total quantity of US government buys for F-35s went up coincidentally enough by about 13 aircraft for additional Marine Corps buys. So pushing up to the right, but again as Marillyn said, lots of opportunity to change those values between now and then. ","Operator","Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. ","George Shapiro","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Marillyn Hewson","Barely, George. Try again.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","On the F-35, the incremental margin was 17%. So did you increase the margin on the LRIP 9 or 10, or both? And then also the deliveries were flat with last year, and down from Q1. So I would think that we'd be starting to see increases here, given the deliveries are going to be higher. So what's happening there? Thanks. ","Bruce Tanner","Yes. George, I\u2019ll try those. So incremental margins, I didn't do the calculation that you just cited, but you're probably right. Your math is always good, George. And we did have a couple of pick-ups. I think we actually - you asked which specific LRIP we had some risk retirements or step ups, and we actually had, I want to say three separate LRIPs. And you should think of these as somewhat older LRIP contracts or LRIP numbers. I believe two of the three were five - LRIPs five and seven. So this is sort of reflecting the fact that we're closing out or getting ready to sort of close out some of those lots. The ones you talked about, the more current ones, Lot 9 and so forth and Lot 10, we're getting good performance on those, but that's probably step ups that we look forward to in the coming years as - coming quarters, as opposed to this quarter here. ","And then as far as deliveries, George, now the way I look at that, I think there's - I think we're planning 66 aircraft to be delivered for the year. And what may not be clear in that number is there\u2019s only - the biggest lion's share of that, 61 of those are being delivered out of Fort Worth. The other five are going to be delivered out of the international locations that Marillyn talked, the FACO in Nagoya, Japan and the other FACO in Italy. So none of those five aircraft have yet to deliver, although they\u2019ve rolled out as Marillyn said. So all those are out in front of us. And as you look at where we ended the first half of the year, we'd actually delivered 29 aircraft. That number is a little deceptive because we closed the quarter actually on June 25 as opposed to the end of the month and we actually had some deliveries between then and the end of the month. As we sit here today, George, I want to say we\u2019ve delivered 34 aircraft so far and I think we're on track to deliver 36 by the end of this month. So we're actually progressing essentially right on track on the domestic deliveries. And we do expect those five international deliveries to all take place in the second half. So short set, I think we're tracking to our expectations relative to 66 aircraft for the year. ","Operator","Our next questions from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. ","Pete Skibitski","Good morning guys. I had a further F-35 and Aeronautics margin question. Just because, Bruce, it seems like the F-35 has been kind of less of a headwind maybe than you expected going into this year. And I know some of it's on better performance at the international facilities and whatnot. But as you look out into 2018, it will be a bigger part of the mix, F-35 and Aeronautics. Do you have any confidence probably yet to say that this year is kind of the trough for Aeronautics margin, and we'll start to expand as we go out on higher F-35? Or is there still some uncertainty in some of the latest LRIP lots?","Bruce Tanner","Just to be clear, Pete, you\u2019re talking about a trough for Aeronautics or a trough for F-35? You were talking about Aeronautics I presume, right?","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Correct. Correct.","Bruce Tanner","You know what, I'm not sure I want to call that in this quarter, Pete. I\u2019ll feel a whole lot better. We do our planning between now and the third quarter. And when we give you the trend information in 2018, I will surely address that then. But I don't think your question is that far off the mark. If the answer is not yes, that's probably where we'd expect the trough, the answer is it\u2019s probably pretty close to that, maybe \u201918 but we'll take a look at that when we give you the trend information in October. ","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Bruce Tanner","Yes, and I should say, in any event we would still expect there - even if it was a trough, I don't see it dropping below 10%. The only question is we've had some, to your point, some pick-ups earlier this year is, can we match that next year going forward? But again I\u2019ll give you a lot more insight in the October call. Thanks.","Operator","Next we go to David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead. ","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, I guess first a clarification. The 3% to 5% revenue growth, and talking about maybe being at the lower end of that in 2018, does that include the change in revenue recognition? That's the clarification. And then thinking about cash conversion, free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years, you've obviously got pension cash moving down. But then as we look out towards the end of the decade, you have - your FAS expense is going to come down. Could you just talk about the progression of how you're seeing free cash flow conversion over the next maybe - towards the end of the decade? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","David, I'm actually glad you asked that clarification on the 3% to 5% were sort of based on current rev-rec methodology. Although we've give more information on this when we have the results, when we give the trend information in October. But at the least preliminarily (indiscernible) pulling together in anticipation of that rev-rec changing, we're kind of I\u2019ll say running rev-rec in addition to the normal methodology for the first quarter and second quarter. I haven't seen the second quarter results yet. But so far everything is indicating that you would think we should see a whole lot of difference. And part of the reason for that is a lot of the units of delivery are what we call POT, Passage on Title transfer where we essentially record sales upon delivery. As long as you're sort of delivering at a constant rate and the program is not at the end of its life if you will, then you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large swing, even when you\u2019ve converted over to a percentage of cost or cost to cost methodology, and that's sort of our expectation. We don't see a large drop off or a large increase or decrease in our POT deliveries there. So most importantly on our rev-rec, F-35 is not - does not change one bit and that's obviously the biggest driver of Aeronautics and for that matter, sales for the corporation. So I'm hopeful having said that, Dave, that the 3% to 5% sort of works under either methodology, the current methodology or the new rev-rec methodology is what I'm trying to say and we\u2019ll see what that looks like when we provide the trend information in \u201918 as I keep saying. ","Relative to the free cash flow conversion, we teed this up. In the past, David, you and I have had a couple of conversations on this. We - I think the - we talked about FAS income. You sort of brought that up. In 2020 - the 2020 timeframe is the end of the accruals relative to our pension trust going forward. So essentially the trust becomes completely frozen at that point in time. And because you lose the service cost, we actually end up getting FAS income in that point in time. As far as cash is concerned, we will expect to see cash contribution, the ERISA contributions continue to increase through that period of time. But we would also expect to see CAS recoveries in our price that are government contracts increase by about a similar amount. So we still expect to have a tailwind associated with pension cash and free cash flow literally going out. I think it\u2019s still consistent what we showed maybe as much as a year ago that all the way out through 2025, at least as we sit here today, we expect to have some tailwind from pension dynamics relative to our cash flow going forward, and that's still what we see today. ","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So since your first quarter, it looks like your foreign sales prospects have improved. Can you update us in terms of what you're looking for, for book to bill this year and any color on next year? And secondly, you mentioned a lot of the foreign potentials. You didn't mention some of the NATO missile defense potentials such as Romania, Sweden, for the Patriot system and MEADS. Thank you very much.","Bruce Tanner","Cai, I\u2019ll take a stab at that and Marillyn can add some color to it if she wants to. So relative to the first question and how we're doing, we're actually tracking hopefully better or better than planned relative to international orders today. I don't have necessarily the book to bill for the year, but I mean trying to do this math in my head, I think we're slightly ahead of book to bill as we sit here today, meaning international order are higher than international sales to date. I would expect that to be the case at the end of the year. A lot of that obviously is predicated on whether or not we get sort of the first tranche of the KSA, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders that Marillyn talked about, those $28 billion worth of orders. There's the potential that some of those can come in between now and the end of the year. It's not obviously clear that they will. There\u2019s obviously some congressional notifications and the like that has to take place and getting the funding employees to do that. But there is that possibility. ","Now, even without that, I still think we'll probably be, probably in a positive situation book to bill because we won't have the sales for that either for international business there. So having said that, as we look out in the future, and you didn\u2019t ask this question, Cai, but we still think we've got a chance to end the year potentially at around $100 billion of backlog if some of these, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders come in this year, as opposed to next year. But even without that, 95 to 100 is probably what we're expecting, and again more on the international side than the sales for the year. So a positive book to bill. ","You asked about the air missile defense. We're still in conversations with Germany right now, the MEADS opportunity there. There's a stated objective to get that negotiation complete by the end of this year. We'll see if that actually closes then, but if not then, I would hope that that closes at least in the early part of 2018. And obviously there's Poland with the Patriot sale and we'll do a lot of the PAC-3 - all the PAC-3 missile associated with that sale. You mentioned some other NATO countries. I\u2019ll let Marillyn maybe jump in and give you a little more insight than I can provide to you.","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. You mentioned Poland, Rumania and others. I mean of course we have Aegis Ashore, which is US system that\u2019s been placed in Europe, but that's an opportunity. Missile defenses, there's a strong demand in Europe, as well as in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific and the Middle East where we continue to see opportunities. JASSM was an opportunity from the standpoint of Poland. And so there - you're exactly right. There continues to be in the NATO environment missile defense opportunities for us to continue to meet, as well as for other parts of the world. And I think as we have recently done the THAAD test out of Alaska, that was a very successful test. In fact, 14 out of 14 on THAAD, one that I'm sure that many countries will take a look at, at the successful capability of that to take out a ballistic missile. And so that being an opportunity that we've talked about that currently in South Korea, protecting that area in Guam. But certainly Japan and other countries will continue to look at THAAD as a capability in the European market as well. ","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. On space, you raised the sales guidance there. And just curious on your outlook for space in general, going here in 2017, where the uptick was coming from. And then if \u201918, this gives you any indication that it's actually got some growth in it. And then conversely, the incremental margins looked a little light, 5% incremental margins. Is that just to absorb the commercial satellite charges, or something else? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","I\u2019ll try those, Myles. So we\u2019re pleased with where space is heading this year in terms of sales. It\u2019s - as I said in the prepared remarks, it's a little higher than our expectations. And obviously we increased the guidance for the year. It\u2019s a little higher than what we expected when we started the year. I do think that portends well for 2018 growth. And there's some of that coming from our special programs business and there are some opportunities there that we have to see how they play out that will drive that either higher or not as high, depending on the outcome of those opportunities. ","And then relative to the incremental margin, you have that right, Myles and that is reflective of the fact that some of that volume was offset by the commercial satellite charge that we did take in the quarter. And that's probably worth talking maybe a little bit about, only because it - that sounds like a bad item to have a charge on the commercial satellite. But this is really taking our old legacy A2100 satellite bus, which we've had for a number of decades and really providing a technology refresh of that legacy satellite. So it's sort of updating it to the current state of the art. We\u2019re putting a whole lot of new technologies and capabilities into it, everything from power capabilities and increases to the propulsion on the satellite, the electronics. We've got a new solar array, new power regulator. So a lot of different items all being sort of put together. And unfortunately the satellite where this happened to be the first article for production, was the largest commercial satellite we ever built, or will have ever built. ","And so - well, that's the bad news. The good news is, is this new configuration satellite has already resulted in new orders from the US government. And I look at it as this is something that we had to do. We had to refresh that product line and while I'd prefer it not to be on a fixed price commercial international contract I have to sort of cut your teeth on, we're glad that we're doing this now because this will position us to have a foundation for new satellite offerings hopefully for years to come. ","Operator","Next we go to with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joe DeNardi","Thanks very much. Bruce, wondering if you could just talk about capital deployment. From a leverage standpoint, are you comfortable with where you are now, and we should just assume that all of the free cash flow gets split up between the buyback and dividend? Or do you see some deleveraging over the next year or two?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So good question, Joe. That\u2019s something we\u2019re - we obviously talk every September with our board relative to future deployment actions relative to dividends, but before that session, before we have those discussions and we discuss that sort of strategic view with our board of directors, I\u2019ll say the expectation is it's sort of more the same in terms of our deployment actions. We do have some near term debt retirements coming up starting in 2018. We\u2019ll come - that's something that we\u2019ll guide you towards relative to the trend information \u201918 as far as our thinking relative. To refinancing that or paying that off. But our expectation is we probably do some deleveraging as I sit here today going forward in the near term. Those aren't huge chunks of debt, but some of these frankly are the very short term financing that we did actually to finance the Sikorsky transaction","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Bruce, just sticking on Sikorsky, which you just mentioned - total military helicopter deliveries were down about 18% year to date. How are you thinking about that for the balance of the year? And then in the context of obviously the new multiyear with the US Army and Saudi, how should we think about the government deliveries going forward?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So this question, Peter, that's actually something I looked at as I was prepping for the call also. The first half deliveries of Black Hawks are down. And at least as I post that with our team at RMS, that really is just because of the timing of the contract deliveries in the current multi-year eight Black Hawk order profile. Even though we're down as you pointed out relative to last year, the expectation is that we still expect to actually deliver more Black Hawks this year than we did last year, just not a huge number, just a handful there. But we would expect to catch up and actually have sort of sequential growth in Black Hawk deliveries, with fourth quarter obviously being the highest by quite a bit relative to the first quarter. A little bit of a different pattern than what we saw in 2016, but that is the contractual pattern. And I didn't look close enough to see if that's because of the types of aircraft we have. We have some MEDEVAC helos versus utility helicopters and that might be part of it as well. But all sort of expected and that is the plan going forward again to sort of finish the year higher than we did this year. ","You also asked about - there was another part of your question, Peter. I think you asked about 2018 relative to the multiyear nine. the multiyear nine, I think in - and I haven't got my head exactly around the deliveries next year, but I think they're fairly complement - maybe a little less than this year, but not hugely less. Alternatively as we look forward, the biggest - bigger drop off frankly is in the Romeo helicopters. These are the Naval Hawk helicopters if you will. That's sort of coming to a much lower number of production aircraft delivery like maybe by a third or so or more reduction next year. So one thing that we're watching to see if we can get some rebound on that is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. One of the items that was in that, actually two of the items that was in that $28 billion that Marillyn referenced before was for additional Black Hawks on top of what's in the multi-year nine Black Hawk deal today. And an additional - or additional Romeos are the Naval Hawk helicopters as well. So those have got to sort out and again the timing event, Peter is what we're watching very, very closely to see whether or not those orders come in this year, the early part of next year. But we're hopeful they can sort of butt up against the multi-year nine deliveries we're talking about.","Greg Gardner","John, this is Greg. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Jason Gursky","Good morning. I wanted to - Marillyn, I want to ask you about the Company's supply chain, your strategy there. You've spoken in the past about the need for Lockheed and its suppliers to focus on two things, affordability and cybersecurity, essentially to ensure continuity. Can you provide us a bit of an update on the Company's effort to drive affordability out of the supply chain and is your strategy continuing to evolve there? Are you looking to maybe vertically integrate a little bit more than where you've been in the past and as you look out at things, how far along do you think you are in accomplishing your near to medium term goals on affordability? And then on the cybersecurity front, how do you view the health of the industry overall at this point? And what's Lockheed and the rest of the industry currently doing to improve the cybersecurity health of the supply chain? Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jason. Those are great questions. If you look at our supply chain, it represents 60, sometimes 70% of the revenue on many of our programs. It\u2019s a very important element of our business in terms of our execution on programs, performance on programs as well as what we're able to financially accomplish with those programs. So that's great question. On the affordability front, I would just start with our largest program, which is the F-35 and representing last year about 23% of our sales. We put a lot of effort into that piece of it. And collectively with our team mates, major team mates, with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, we worked together on something we call - that the government calls a blueprint for affordability, where we actually put funding upfront working, not just with the three team mates, Lockheed Martin, BAE and Northrop Grumman, but all the way through our supply chain and identifying areas where we can invest, continue to drive cost down on the F-35 beyond what you would normally get through a ramp up of production and the volume. And we'll continue to do that. We\u2019re also doing that on the sustainment side. So look at where are there cost reduction initiatives that we can put in place there that would continue to drive the cost down. But we are - we work with supply chain affordability every day on all of our programs. I feel really good about our affordability initiatives in that regard. Our teams that work directly with our sub-contractors, with our suppliers, that is one of their primary efforts and ones that working alongside them, they\u2019re constantly focused on.","The other thing I would say is where we have a big opportunity on F-35 is through the block buy because that's where we can get the volume reduction. That\u2019s where we can get suppliers, if they know they're going to get three lots worth of work, 450 airplanes and plus, then they can invest in driving the cost down. They can commit to a lower price to us on their element of the system. But bottom line is, we work all the way across our supply chain on ongoing basis and are constantly driving. In terms of vertical integration, I think it really just is driven on a case by case basis where it makes sense. I mean if we're assuming that we think we have the capability inside Lockheed Martin, that we could do at less cost and more - and better technology, then we might look at some vertical integration there or through an acquisition that gives us the opportunity to do that. But generally speaking, we're mainly focused on the affordability and the performance of our supply chain on an ongoing basis.","You asked a question about cybersecurity and sort of the health of the industry and what are we doing on that front. I will just speak from a Lockheed Martin standpoint. We recognize that the supply chain is - it's critically important that they have in place appropriate cyber defenses in their business. And so we have worked with the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards to help put in place voluntary initiatives that - and frameworks that work with supply chain on how they can get employees the appropriate defenses. We then audit and monitor what our supply chain, our suppliers have in the way of cybersecurity defenses on an ongoing basis. And we actually work with our customer. Our customer often looks to us for the depth and capability we have in cybersecurity. It is a line of business for us. We do it for many customers and supporting them, and we likewise take that same capability and try to work it back through the supply chain as well.","In terms of health of the industry, I think it's an ongoing effort that we've got to constantly stay focused on as a nation. The threats are constantly changing or there's always an unpredictability in that sense. But we've been a thought leader and an industry leader in cybersecurity for many years. In fact we have the national cyber range where we develop that and where our government customers and others can bring their solutions and test them on those national cyber range and determine whether it brings the kind of defenses that we're looking for, that they expect. And so I would say across the board, cyber has been an area for us that, as in everything that we do across the system, it runs through all of our programs. It is - we have a robust capability that we provide to customers and we work hard with our supply chain to make sure that they get the right defenses in their own networks on ongoing basis. Thank you. ","So I think that that was the last question. Greg, let me just wrap back and conclude the call today. I want to conclude by restating that our second quarter results and our increased 2017 outlook reflect that we have an ongoing commitment to our strategy for growth, strong cash generation and we continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers and long term value creation for our stockholders. We\u2019re very pleased with the solid results that we had for the quarter. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call in October. So John, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Gardner","Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call today. As today's release illustrates, we continue to outperform the goals we set at the beginning of 2018, with another quarter of strong operational accomplishments, important new business awards and outstanding financial results. We've seen strong financial performance across the entire corporation. And this performance, coupled with our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, has resulted in us updating our guidance again this quarter.","I'm especially pleased to see our earnings and cash expectations continue to grow as we remain focused on operational performance and delivering long-term value to shareholders. Our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance and improved full year projections are the result of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of offerings as each of our 4 business areas contributed to our updated 2018 financial outlook.","We will discuss the financials in detail a little later in the call, but I do want to highlight two key actions that our Board of Directors took this quarter in the area of cash deployment. First, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10% to $2.20 per share or $8.80 annually, maintaining our long-standing commitment to a strong dividend. Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $1 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to $3.7 billion. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit.","Together, these two actions demonstrate our continued strategy of balanced cash deployment and long-term commitment to delivering returns for our stockholders. ","I'll cover performance highlights in just a moment, but I want to begin by noting several strategic new business awards that we received this quarter, which position us for long-term growth in our existing portfolio, as well as affording us exciting new opportunities.","In August, our Lockheed Martin Space team received an initial $2.9 billion reward from U.S. Air Force for 3 next-generation missile warning satellites. These overhead persistent infrared, or OPIR, satellites build upon our legacy SBIRS spacecraft with a modernized bus and increased survivability, delivering advanced early warning and improved resiliency. We look forward to delivering these next-gen capabilities with this new opportunity. [Technical Difficulty] competitor contract of over $1.3 billion for the first two GPS follow-on satellites, with a total estimated contract value of up to $7.2 billion for 22 new GPS-IIIF spacecraft. These new GPS space vehicles are designed to provide greater accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities, providing the technology upgrades to ensure GPS-III remains the gold standard in navigation, positioning and timing.","Moving to our Aeronautics business area. We secured approximately $1.7 billion in orders for 22 additional C-130J transport planes. The results of the increases included in 2017 and 2018 fiscal year omnibus appropriations legislation. These awards bring our C-130J backlog to 70 aircraft, another example of the enduring demand for this legendary platform.","In Missiles and Fire Control, we were very excited to be awarded the $480 million Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW program, to provide critical design review and production readiness support for new hypersonic weapon. The ARRW contract marks our third 2018 award in this emerging technological area, and when combined with the previously announced Tactical Boost Glide and Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, or HCSW programs, brings the aggregate value of our 2018 hypersonic awards to over $1.5 billion.","We were disappointed, though, at not being selected for 3 large competitive bids this quarter. We believe our proposals represented outstanding technical offerings at our lowest possible pricing. Had we matched the winning prices and been awarded the contracts, we estimate that we would have incurred cumulative losses across all three programs in excess of $5 billion, an outcome that we do not feel would have been in the best interest of our stockholders or our customers.","As we conduct our lessons learned process, we will seek to discover any root cause issues which may lead us to alter our future capture strategies. However, our objective will always be to position the corporation to perform with excellence for our customers while delivering outstanding value to our stockholders.","Our new business pipeline remains robust and our win rates remain strong. The strategic awards I noted earlier contributed to the corporation recording over $18 billion in awards during the third quarter and allowed our backlog to climb to over $109 billion, a new high watermark.","Turning briefly to the Department of Defense budgets. The President signed into law the DoD 2019 fiscal year appropriations act last month, the first time in a decade that an appropriations bill has been enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. The act provides approximately $670 billion of base budget funding for the nation's security and defense programs. The legislation aligns with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided with an additional $80 billion for national defense over 2 years in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. ","The final FY '19 appropriations also reflect continued support for our broad portfolio as funding was increased from the Presidential budget request for some of our key programs, including 16 additional F-35 jets; 14 additional THAAD interceptors, 8 additional C-130J aircraft; 8 additional BLACK HAWK helicopters and 2 additional Littoral Combat Ships. These increases were supported by both House and Senate appropriations committees and reflects strong bipartisan support for these platforms.","Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant milestones we achieved across the corporation during the past quarter, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. We saw 4 significant events take place this quarter. In September, we finalized an $11.5 billion Low-Rate Initial Production, or LRIP, 11 contract with the Department of Defense for the production and delivery of 141 F-35 aircraft. Notably, we came to agreement on unit prices, which are the lowest in program history, with the F-35A, our conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL variant, achieving an $89.2 million price, a 5.4% reduction from the LRIP 10 per unit amount. We remain focused on delivering the best value to our U.S. services, international partner nations and Foreign Military Sales customers as we continue to pursue achieving an $80 million CTOL target price.","The F-35 program also continued its maturation process as it was approved to transition into the operational test and evaluation, or OTE phase, in November. The Defense Department had certified the programs readiness to enter the OTE phase, one of the final steps being approved for full rate production. ","Also in September, F-35 aircraft participated in their first U.S. combat mission as the U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs successfully conducted an air strike in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel ground clearance operations in Afghanistan. ","The Marine Corps was the first service to declare the F-35 ready for initial operational capability in 2017, and the aircraft has been deployed as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group, enabling enhanced stability and security from international waters and demonstrating the remarkable capabilities of this fifth-generation fighter.","Lastly, on the F-35. We were all extremely proud to see our U.K. Ministry of Defense partner celebrate an F-35B performing its first carrier landing as British pilots touched down on the HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Atlantic Ocean, laying the foundation for the future of fixed-wing aviation aboard the U.K. carrier fleet. The F-35 subsequently took flight using the ship's ski ramp platform and later performed successful night landings on the carrier, both with and without the use of night vision technology. The F-35 and the HMS Queen Elizabeth are at the beginning of the 2-month developmental test process to establish the envelope for the F-35 to operate from the deck of the ship, and we are very happy to be part of these landmark events.","Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area. We saw strong domestic and international demand for our tactical missile products this quarter, as well as continued international PAC-3 support in our air and missile defense organization. ","In our tactical missiles organization, we were awarded an FMS contract totaling over $630 million to provide Hellfire missiles to the Netherlands and Japan.","Our tactical missiles team also received a pair of awards totaling over $0.5 billion for 42 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, launchers and associated hardware to be delivered to the U.S. Army and international customers. ","Earlier this quarter, U.S. and Swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide PAC-3 MSE missiles to the government of Sweden, helping to increase the country's defensive capabilities and support interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces. Sweden will become the sixth international customer to sign an agreement for PAC-3 MSE missiles, and we look forward to providing our leading-edge missile defense products in support of their national security objectives.","I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems business area and discuss several noteworthy achievements from our Sikorsky team. First, the Sikorsky S-97 Raider prototype helicopter demonstrated the ability to fly at speeds exceeding 200 knots during recent flight testing at our Sikorsky development flight center. The Raider aircraft incorporates our Collier award-winning X2 Technology, a suite of capabilities, which include our innovative counter-rotating blade design, fly-by-wire flight controls and advanced vehicle management systems to provide a critical speed and handling quality needed by today's warfighter.","The X2 technology allows for speeds twice that of conventional helicopters, and we look forward to offering this unique solution to the U.S. Army as it begins to revolutionize its aircraft fleet as part of the upcoming Future Vertical Lift program. ","I would also like to congratulate the Sikorsky team on an upcoming milestone as October 31 will mark the 40th anniversary of the first BLACK HAWK delivery to the U.S. Army in 1978. The iconic BLACK HAWK helicopter has more than 10 million flight hours, supporting our army customers' brave missions and has played a key role in humanitarian efforts, aerial firefighting and border patrols as well. Over 4,000 BLACK HAWKs of all types are in service worldwide. And I would like to thank the Sikorsky organization for their dedication in delivering this remarkable aircraft to our customers for the past 40 years. And we look forward to continuing this partnership for years to come.","These two significant accomplishments come at a time when we will be recognizing another key milestone. This November, we will mark the third anniversary of Sikorsky aircraft joining the Lockheed Martin family. The Sikorsky organization has expanded and strengthened our corporation's portfolio over the short time, and I would like to thank the entire team for their efforts as we celebrate this important occasion.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Once again, we exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the quarter as we did through the first half of this year. Sales, segment operating profit and cash from operations before making our final pension contribution for the year continued to be strong. The $1.5 billion pension contributions we made in the third quarter completes the $5 billion of pension outlays that we've been discussing all year.","We continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning around $800 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And we grew our backlog to a record $109 billion in the quarter, with all 4 business areas contributing to that growth. Based on our performance in the quarter, we expect strong results for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the full year, as we'll show in a few charts. ","We were pleased with how our financial results are shaping up thus far in 2018, and we'll be discussing how our performance this year is carrying over into next year when we get to our charts showing preliminary trends for 2019 later in the presentation.","Turning to Chart 4. We compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. I'll note for comparison purposes that the third quarter of this year has 14 weeks in the accounting period while last year's third quarter had 13 weeks in the accounting period, and this situation will reverse itself in the fourth quarter when we have 13 weeks this year and will compare to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of last year. Even without the extra week in the quarter, our results exceeded our expectations. With that background, sales grew 16% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.3 billion, continuing the momentum we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 23% over last year's level to nearly $1.6 billion. ","And all four business areas contributed to the significant increases in both sales and profit in the quarter, while the margin increases in the quarter were driven primarily by RMS due to improved performance in our Sikorsky and integrated warfare systems and sensors lines of businesses and by Space due to improved performance in our government satellites line of business. On Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.14 was $1.82 or 55% higher than our results last year, driven by higher sales volume, the margin improvements that I just discussed and a lower tax rate in the quarter compared to last year.","Moving on to Chart 6. We provide our revised outlook for the year. With only the fourth quarter left in the year, we are providing our best point estimate of results for the entire year rather than the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. We expect sales to be around $53 billion for the year, near the top of the guidance range we provided last quarter and 6% higher than our results in 2017. At $5.8 billion, our forecasted segment operating profit will exceed the top end of our guidance range last quarter, resulting in a 10.9% margin, about 70 basis points higher than last year's results.","Our FAS\/CAS pension adjustment remains unchanged at a little more than $1 billion. Our earnings per share is expected to be around $17.50, also above the high end of our previous guidance range, recognizing the strong performance in our business segment operating profit as well as a lower tax rate in our lower estimates, which I'll discuss further in a moment. And we're increasing our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million to be equal to or greater than $3.4 billion as we expect a large portion of our earnings increase to be billed and collected before year-end.","Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our earnings per share outlook this quarter compared to last quarter. Operational performance is expected to drive a $0.40 increase in EPS, driven by higher segment operating profit as a result of higher sales volume and margins in our business areas. Taxes and other are expected to add another $0.20 in EPS, with most of that increase coming from a lower tax rate as we continue to reflect the latest understanding of the tax legislation passed last year. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 13.5% and 14%. Together, these changes represent an expected $0.60 improvement from the midpoint of the EPS range we provided last quarter to a new outlook of $17.50 per share. ","Chart 8 shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year, also with point estimates for each of the business areas rather than the ranges we provided in the prior outlook. We are increasing our sales outlook by $650 million compared to the midpoint of our last guidance. We expect it to be near or slightly above the high end of the guidance range from last quarter, continuing the strong results we've seen so far this year.","On Chart 9, we provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. We're increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $150 million from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter, and our point estimate is above the high end of that range. Three of the 4 business areas are expected to exceed the high end of their prior range, showing the broad-based nature of our performance improvements.","On Chart 10, we provide our preliminary look at our 2019 trends. We expect our 2019 sales level will grow 5% to [Technical Difficulty] '18 sales, which equates to approximately a 6% to 7% increase over the midpoint in the 2018 guidance range we provided in July. We expect our segment operating margin will remain strong at between 10.5% and 10.8%. This margin level assumes similar performance in our legacy programs in all business areas with some dilution resulting from the growing number of new start programs, as the increases in our backlog levels would indicate.","We also expect to have lower equity earnings associated with the ULA business as a result of the number and mix of launches expected in 2019 compared with 2018. We estimate that our cash from operations will be at least $7 billion, as we've noted in previous calls, and we have no planned pension contributions next year. ","We also plan to have at least $1 billion in share repurchases, about the same levels we expect to have in 2018, more than offsetting any planned share issuances in the year. And similar to 2018, we have a debt maturity coming due next year worth $900 million.","Moving to our FAS\/CAS outlook. We expect our 2019 FAS\/CAS adjustment will be approximately $1.5 billion or about $500 million higher than the adjustment for 2018. This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 4.125% or 50 basis points above the 2018 rate. Based on our performance to-date, we are assuming a 1% return on our assets for the full year. And going forward, we are reducing our long-term asset return assumption by 50 basis points to 7% per year.","All told, we expect to see continued strong growth in the 2019 based on the mix of follow-on extensions of our legacy programs and a number of quality, new and exciting orders that demonstrate the long-term strength of our portfolio.","And finally, on Chart 11, we have our summary. We've seen strong performance from all of our business areas this year, and I'm especially pleased with our year-to-date orders, both in quantity and quality. Our full year outlook has improved in all financial metrics, and we look forward to continued growth in 2019.","With that, we're ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And first, we'll go to the line of Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","So a quick question for you, first on the margin side. So the implied mix that you're talking about, can you give us maybe quantification of how much the growth in cost versus fixed price and also maybe by segments, a bit more color on where the 10 to 50 basis points of headwind is coming from?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, thanks, Myles. I'll take that one on. I think the simplest way to understand it is we are seeing pretty much new starts in all of our business areas, and you've seen some of that in prior orders that were released. And frankly, some of that you haven't seen because some of that has occurred on some classified contracts and actually multiple business areas. So I won't be able to get into probably as much detail as you would like in that discussion, but suffice to say that that's actually causing some of that margin pressure that we're seeing going forward as well. The largest single item that is driving the margin reduction next year, though, is actually our ULA equity earnings. Those are actually going -- we expect those to be down nearly $150 million or so from this year's estimate of the equity earnings from ULA. And you should think of that as a pretty significant reduction in both the launch quantity in terms of the number of vehicles launched, but probably more importantly, a pretty significant change in the mix of those launch vehicles. So we have more, for instance, Delta IV launches in 2018 than we expect to have in 2019. Those are obviously the most profitable launch vehicles in all of ULA's portfolio. ","So that's the biggest driver. But as I said, without going into all the various pieces, maybe I'll tell you what. I'll try to hit just a couple of the business areas maybe very quickly going into next year. I'll give you more detail on this, Myles, when we talk to you in January. But as far as the margins in aeronautics, we actually expect those to be fairly similar next year to what they are this year. And that kind of goes to the comment I think I made in my prepared remarks, where we actually do expect to have legacy programs, as we're calling them, have increases in margins year-over-year. But start-up activities, including by the way, I'll count the F-16 production program as a restart there. We've been out of production for some 3 years, so that's one example of where I would cite we have production I can talk about. Other programs in some of the classified, in the Skunk Works areas, the contract activity that's driving us to have kind of a flat margin going forward. Our Missiles and Fire Control margins, probably maybe slightly lower, comparable to slightly lower than it is this year.","And again, the same story is within aeronautics. Legacy programs are actually expected to have margin improvement. We're actually seeing pretty good growth in our SOF GLSS contracts, higher than we expected, quite honestly. And you recall that contract brings lower margin than in the overall portfolio of Missiles and Fire Control. Probably the biggest single driver, though, at Missiles and Fire Control is a whole bunch of new starts. And you should think of those as hypersonic programs, new starts, as well as a number of other programs, including classified activity that's going on there that we've talked about orders being received previously on this call. RMS, right now, we're looking at actually pretty comparable margin going forward. So really, you should think of the first 3 business areas that I've talked about, ARRW, Missiles and Fire Control and RMS all having comparable -- maybe slightly less in Missiles and Fire Control. The biggest driver, as I said, earlier, is Space Systems or Space, and that's primarily because of the ULA equity earnings there. The rest of the portfolio is actually performing about as expected next year compared to this year.","Operator","Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","I wanted to ask a multiple-part question on F-35. It looks like F-35 in the quarter grew fairly significantly well above kind of the delivery rate growth. Can you talk about kind of how far in terms of the revenue growth we're seeing, how that breaks out between production and sustainment? Kind of how far ahead we are based on going from 91 deliveries this year to 130? And then last one, on your cost curve, obviously, the price per LRIP is coming down like 5%, 6%. Can you talk about your cost curve? What kind of learning you're seeing from a cost perspective?","Bruce Tanner","David, I'll take that one on as well. So you had a lot of parts in that question. I'm just going to try to keep up with them. Relative to revenue growth on F-35, I think what you surmise is pretty accurate. And we did have some pretty significant growth in the quarter. I think we were double-digit, actually a little more than double-digit on F-35 in the quarter. As we look, and maybe that's the heart of your question, what does that look like next year, I think, you said relative to the ramp-up from 91 to about 130 aircraft. We would expect F-35 next year to also grow probably at the double-digit, maybe a little bit higher than that. And that's for both production and sustainment activity, David. And the one wildcard that I'll mention that really did surprise me as well as we were getting ready for this call is that actually the development activity on F-35 is going to grow at double-digit rate next year. So part of that is we had a pretty significant reduction in the older SDD contract from 2017 to 2018, but we're starting to see more and more sort of new noncore SDD development activities being added to the contract. And that's actually growing, as I said earlier. That's growing, the development portfolio, higher than double-digit from 2018 to 2019, so that's kind of a pleasant surprise for us.","Cost curve, I don't have the learning. Maybe Marillyn does at the top of her head. I want to say we were at the mid-80s to maybe a little bit higher percent learning curve on F-35. I think that's about right that we've been running about that level, almost since the LRIP 1, David. So we're still maintaining that. At some point in time, that will start to level out as we've kind of branched all we can out of our learning curve, and that's where we need to have some potential investments to get some sort of step improvements going forward there. But at least, right now sort of year-to-date and we're still -- or Q-to-date and we're still seeing that trend. Think of it as mid- to higher 80% learning curve is what we're experiencing on F-35. by the way, very much in line with what we've seen on other legacy production programs, if not slightly better.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Marillyn, I just wanted to follow up on your comments regarding those programs you've lost in the quarter and the potential $5 billion hit. Are you concerned that this is changing the landscape for defense contracting, and the sort of low ball bids could make your future profitability less attractive?","Marillyn Hewson","No, not for us. I mean, that's not the kind -- that's not what you would expect from Lockheed Martin, and that was the point in my opening remarks is that we're going to pursue good business for this company and being able to perform at what we say we can perform, too, for our customers. So that's the key for us. How other competitors behave in this environment, I really can't speak to you. You'll have to ask them.","Robert Stallard","That was more from the other direction. Is this potentially what the customers are now expecting as they see these prices out there?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, we have seen -- we've talked about this in the past call, so that -- we obviously made a clarification on what you're asking. We do see that the affordability is a very important element for them, and a lot of these best value procurements, when we know that we've got a good technology solution when it comes down to lowest cost technically acceptable -- lowest price technically acceptable, LPTA-type decision, we are seeing -- we are assuming that's happening because if you come in with a technical solution that's good and comparable, and you meet all of those elements, but then they just go for lowest price and ultimately, that could be the opportunity that the government is taking on affordability. And they cite that. We've seen in the media that they would cite that they've gotten things at much lower than they anticipated. Bruce, anything you want to add?","Bruce Tanner","The one thing I want to add, Marillyn, is -- Rob, I think I wouldn't necessarily draw a long conclusion from 3 awards. I'll tell you, those were disappointing for a lot of reasons. But the fact that they were really decided, all 3 of them, on sort of a LPTA basis didn't help the situation. It's not getting -- I would argue, the best capabilities for the warfighter in the hands of the warfighter. What else? I don't think that's entirely universal amongst all the competitions that we've seen this year. And we frankly won some competitions where we weren't the highest price. So I do know that you can automatically, as I said, draw a conclusion that, that's necessarily a change from on every program that's going to be competed going forward. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, if you will.","Operator","And our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","Bruce, some of the commentary you provided on the margin, I was wondering if you can give us some perspective on sales growth, including on some of the single aisles, which impacted 2018. How [indiscernible] what the prospect is for growth to accelerate in '19?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, so as we said, we experienced growth all throughout 2018. And we talked about that on previous calls as far as how we came out with roughly a 2% expectation, we ended up actually having 6% growth over 2017. And I think in the past, I attributed that to the significant plus-up in terms of the omnibus increases. Many -- higher rate of awards, and especially in the first half of the year than what we were expecting to have and an earlier turn-on for a lot of those awards than what was historically we've seen. This, I think, speaks to the speed concept that Secretary Mattis always talks about now, is getting things to the warfighter's hands quicker. So I think that was part of the reason we're seeing in 2018 as high as we are. 2019, I'll try to do the same, if you will. I think the highest growing business area is going to be Missiles and Fire Control. I think they're going to grow probably a little bit north of double-digit, maybe not much more than that. Next up is aeronautics, which collectively, I think, is probably going to grow probably in the high single digits, not quite the double-digit level but that's still good growth there.","RMS and right now, both RMS and Space are expected to be sort of comparable to where our results were for 2018 or where they're expected to be for 2018. I think that there's a business area or two that I could point to, where there may be some opportunity to get some growth beyond that. The comparable level is probably in both of those. I think we had some potentially good news, for instance, on the Canadian Surface Combatant competition and depending on when that gets fully awarded. I won't go through the entire process. That has the potential, I think, to create some growth going forward. So I'm watching those faces, but you should think of it, Jon, as really the Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control sort of carrying the heavy load in terms of sales growth, with Space and RMS somewhat comparable expectation to where they are this year, with hopefully some upside to that level.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Safran","Bruce, I think this is going to be for you. And I'm going to ask you a bit of a forward-looking question here. And if you feel you can't answer it, just tell me and I'll ask something else. The long-term 2018 to 2020 cash from ops guide was not in the slides. So I thought I'd ask you about that. Would you comment on your 2018 to 2020 cash from operations trends? And would you care to comment on 2021? And if you can't answer it, would you include in your answer just a general discussion of major programs, about what's baked into your guidance and what's not?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Thanks, Rich. Let me figure out how to better navigate through your question there. So we've given sort of 3-year numbers in the past. We're actually going to talk about that probably more in the January call, but I'll give it a shot here as well. So in the past, we've said that we had expected about $3 billion in 2018. We're ending up at about $3.4 billion, so a pretty good beat relative to our expectations there. We still see in 2000 -- I would say, 2019 we're providing a trend information of at least $7 billion. We still see $7 billion, which we teed up in one of those charts that we briefed previously in 2020. And you should think of that, Rich, as we're actually seeing some pretty good-sized working capital growth in both 2019 and 2020 associated with a lot of our new start programs. It so happened that it happens on a time when it's sort of fortunate for us because it happens in 2 years where we don't have pension contribution, so we're kind of able to have nice, robust cash in both '19 and '20, even while we're growing working capital. The fortunate thing about 2021 is that working capital starts to actually reverse itself, so we actually start to recover a lot of the working capital growth we're actually seeing in '18, '19 and '20.","And at least as we sit here today, Rich, and I'm not trying to give a 3-year guidance number for you, but I would think that the 2021 cash ought to be fairly comparable to our cash from operations in 2019 and 2020. And that's despite the fact that we start making pension contributions at a pretty good magnitude in 2021, somewhere north of $1.5 billion or so. So you should think of that as we're recovering working capital in that time frame. We're also starting to have higher depreciation recovery in terms of cash recovered versus the capital expenditure increases we've seen in the last couple of years, and we expect to see next year as well. And then lastly, the profit growth we're getting from the sales growth that we talked about earlier. So sort of those three things is what's giving us a pretty -- as we sit here today, at least, I'll say a fairly good expectation that we can hold at the $7 billion level, at least as we're looking out for the next 3 years or so.","Operator","Our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel Pearlstein","I just want to follow up on that comment you just made about capital spending. And I guess I'm trying to just think about that as we project forward, how much does it increase and when does that increase stop? And is this new facility, that go with a lot of the wins that you've seen to-date? I mean, can you just characterize where that money is going?","Bruce Tanner","So Sam, I'll take that. It seems like I get this question every year, and every year it seems like I'm saying next year is sort of the peak of capital expenditures. And unfortunately, that's not the case now. But I would argue this is all good news. Capital expenditures next year, probably going to be $1.5 billion or more than that, slightly, so a pretty good increase from this year. At least, in our 3-year planning, the 2020 capital expenditures are actually higher than 2019. And then, they come down actually fairly dramatically in the 2021 time frame. So our free cash flow will start to look better in 2021 because of that. And most of it -- you kind of nailed it, Sam. Think of this as the continuing ramp-up of both buildings and tooling at Missiles and Fire Control to support capacity increases for weapons and air missile defense programs. So I think I've talked about in previous calls that we're seeing significant demand to increase production rates on a number of our programs, particularly the weapons but not exclusively weapons, also air missile defense. And I like to use the example of Hellfire. I think we're building similar -- I think the capacity numbers we're being asked to support, we're going to go up to like 11,000 per year or more. PAC-3, we've got a request that could potentially go up to 500 missiles per year.","So we're seeing some fairly good-sized requests in terms of additional capacity. That's the good news. And the good news, I guess, also is that it takes capital to support those requirements in order to support those increases that will result in growth in the out years once that capacity comes online. So that's what's going on at Missiles and Fire Control. At Space, we're completing sort of a fairly large infrastructure support to have a brand-new sort of manufacturing facility for larger satellites that will actually result in a more efficient build of those satellites as well. And that sort of starts to finalize, I think in 2019. And then finally, we actually are seeing a ramp-up of both buildings and the tooling in those buildings at Aeronautics, primarily to support our Skunk Works or ADP programs out in the West Coast. So this is where a lot of the stuff that we can't necessarily talk about is going on. But it does take added infrastructure to support that going forward. So the three big chunks, that's the reason for the capital increases over the next couple year. Marillyn, I don't know if there anything else I left out.","Marillyn Hewson","I think you covered it, Bruce. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Douglas Harned","A question that I think -- I feel like just has to be asked right now is given the political situation with Saudi Arabia, can you give us a sense of what your backlog exposure is to Saudi and to UAE? And how are you thinking about the current political environment and the relationship with Saudi? How do you work with that with your portfolio?","Marillyn Hewson","Yes, thanks for the question, Doug. I'll just first remind you and the rest of the folks on the call that most of these agreements that we have are government to government purchases, so anything that we do has to do with following strictly the regulations of the U.S. government. In a way, that includes sales to Saudi Arabia. And we do business in more than 70 countries, so this is just the way we do business, generally speaking, is through government to government procurements. And they certainly are the ones that we've been talking about, the weapons sales we've been talking about to Saudi Arabia. We continue to make progress on the programs that we had talked about from the May of 2017 announcement way back then. For example, we announced this quarter that our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant program with Saudi Arabia has moved forward with some additional -- an additional $450 million contract for detailed planning and design for their multi-mission combatant. That was already on the contract. And then beyond that, we'll just work with the U.S. government as they're continuing their relationship with Saudi. In terms of the outlook, Bruce, do you want to take that?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, I'll take a shot at that, Doug. So I look at this. And really, we were thinking we possibly could get a question on this during the call. But we've really just had, as Marillyn said, the one significant order so far, which was for the MMSC. So think of that as a next-generation LCS, if you will, but more capable ship. The largest order that we've been waiting on obviously, is THAAD, and that has not taken place yet, not sure when that will take place. But the interesting thing about the THAAD order is while it brings a significant increase in the backlog, the resulting sales, profit and cash flow with that order are very much pushed to the right. And you should think of that, Doug, as it's because there's a dependency on the radar that has to have a technology refresh, that is actually some years out into the future. So even with the large orders, we would not have significant sales in the near term because those missiles would be arriving too soon to be supported by the actual radar that needs to be refreshed, as I said. So I think the initial operating capability in Saudi is like 2023, if I'm not mistaken. And just to give you some idea of the level, I don't have -- your question was on backlog. I don't have the exact level of backlog, but I did take a look at sales projections going forward for KSA, and I think we have in 2019 about less than $0.5 billion of sales plan. And I looked out into 2020, it's just less than $900 million of sales. So not a huge amount of dependency on the activity even though the opportunities we've described are much larger than that, obviously.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Maybe, Bruce, just following on to that. Maybe you could just update us on some of the outstanding international contracts that you're expecting maybe before the end of the year and just any levels of backlog, where you sit, that you're finishing up?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Probably not so much international orders as fourth quarter is always the quarter where we get quite a bit of domestic orders from the U.S. government. It's the first quarter of the fiscal year, and that tends to have quite a bit going on, with new funds being left there. The biggest order, obviously, by far is -- and I should have said that does include international orders as well. And there is the F-35 economic order quantity or block buy. You should think of that as about 219 aircraft comprising lots 12, 13 and 14, both for U.S. aircraft, all 3 variants, as well as a significant amount of international aircraft as well. So that's, obviously, the biggest single order. You should think of that as approaching $30.5 billion or so. We also expect to get the added FY '18 20 aircraft that came on the FY '18 appropriations in the fourth quarter as well. And then, we'll get quite a few -- I'll say the normal, as I said, first quarter, the fiscal year orders for things like the PAC-3 fiscal year '19, probably another block buy of THAAD missiles. All the normal orders have sort of come up with that fiscal year.","We're looking at actually growing backlog in large part because of the -- we actually have a record backlog, as Marillyn said and as I've said, in the third quarter, but we expect that number will exceed $120 billion by the end of the year, primarily because of what we just talked about on the F-35 block buy but not obviously exclusive to that. Going forward, in the 2019, I won't go too forward into the year, but we would expect to hopefully get -- at U.S. international, we'd expect to see an F-16 Slovakia order next year. I think we have next year out of the 24 C-130s, that we expect to get probably about 11 will be international aircraft and 6 of those hopefully for Germany in that category. Let's see, what else, I'm thinking out loud. That's probably enough for right now. Like I said, a lot of the other orders in our business areas are really coming from domestic sources, like some Orion orders. We're going to get 2 -- we'll, I can't think what the E stands for. It's the flight of the Orion.","Marillyn Hewson","Exploration.","Bruce Tanner","Exploration something. We already got 2 of those orders on Orion next year, so it's a pretty good-sized order within our Space business. And again, as I've mentioned earlier, Peter, we have the potential for closing on the Canadian Surface Combatant, which is a huge program. I think that's probably the largest shipbuilding program in the world once it starts, and we will be the integrator and combat system provider for that. I think the total content potentially that comes out of that is north of $7 billion. So wouldn't expect to get that all in one fell swoop in an order in 2019, but that will be the initial start of something that large.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Marillyn, I wanted to come back to you, I guess ask you another political question. There's been some discussion recently about lower defense budgets for fiscal '20. I think it's like 5% or so of the decline. How do you interpret that? And do you have any insight as to what the base that may be using to step down from? And if it is some sort of contraction, how do you think Lockheed is positioned? What are the risks and opportunities we should be thinking about?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Rajeev. I guess as we look at fiscal year '20, right now the President -- that future year defense program input that came out earlier this year was showing an increase -- a modest increase in FY '20 funding levels, and we'll just have to see what's actually submitted in the presidential budget. That doesn't come in until early next year. We'll wait to see. But I'll just remind you, it was very healthy in FY '18 and '19 with -- giving not only us, but our industry counterparts, a lot more visibility. And as you know, we have long-cycle business, and so we've got a lot of things in motion now as we would be looking into 2020. We're always mindful of the BCA caps because they come back into play in 2020 and 2021. And we're always [indiscernible] with our lawmakers to [indiscernible] and they need to address that. And they have been addressing that for these two year bipartisan budget cap agreements that they put in place. So hopefully, they will continue to do that because Secretary Mattis and the Trump administration have highlighted that we've got to continue to modernize our military. Now I do know that the President did come out and asked all the departments across the government to look at a reduction of 5% in their spending, and that's just a way to try to focus on affordability and reducing cost, but we'll see how they come back with DoD because they have also been very strong about the need to focus on defense spending and modernizing our military. So we'll see how that plays out. But back to my point earlier, right now we're seeing a modest increase for FY '20. Who knows, it could be even higher because of the modernization that needs to happen.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Bruce, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about cash and working capital. And so first of all, if we think about bridging the cash from, if we thought about kind of $3.5 billion or so of operating cash flow this year and then not having to -- no pension contributions would probably get you pretty close to 7. And then, your underlying operating profit growth is probably another 200 or so after tax. And then, the working capital kind of takes that -- takes a little bit of chunk out of that. Is that, at least for your initial guidance, which I assume is probably -- you want to take account of -- be a little bit conservative. But is that kind of a -- are those the big pieces in terms of how we get from last year to -- or this year to next year?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, I think you've got it pretty well nailed, Seth. And the only thing I might throw out there is we'll get, obviously, a little bit lower tax -- cash taxes paid because of deductibility of future pension contributions that we'll be making in that time frame as well.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","So a couple of questions, Bruce, for you. Just on the F-35, I know you talked about the learning curve and Marillyn did as well, but you did have this tremendous incremental margin in the quarter, best in 3 years. And if you could just talk to how that changes as that learning curve flattens, I think you were about 24%. I'm sure there were some maybe unusual things in there. But if you talk a little bit about that margin trend and how we see that going forward. And then separately, is there -- with the volatility in equity markets, is there a return on assets level or underperformance that would require return to ERISA contributions in '19 and '20?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, let me take the -- well, I'll think about your second. Let me take your first one there. So we did have some pretty good step-ups, or risk retirements as we call them, on F-35 in the quarter. You should think of that as mostly, I'll say getting to sort of an annual review of older production contracts that took place in the third quarter. So I think the step-ups we have, the biggest ones were actually on LRIP 8 and LRIP 9. And that's just sort of taking both of those programs, I think -- that's just sort of taking both of those programs from where we had booked profit up to date to sort of where we expect to be at contract closeout. And that happened to be in this quarter. And just given the size of those contracts and the size of the difference we had and where we were booking versus where we expect to be at completion, that ended up being a pretty good-sized risk requirement.","Trend going forward, as I said and maybe it wasn't clear, but this is one of those legacy programs that I would think we'd have the ability to do a little bit of margin improvement, and we actually did cross the 10% ROS level in 2018 for the entire program, which we've been talking about for a long, long time that, that was sort of the year we were targeting, and we actually got there this year. I think there might be some potential for incremental improvement going forward. But I think more of the story of F-35 is just going to be the volume of the -- or sort of similar to maybe slightly improving margins going forward trend-wise, as we would characterize it. As far as the pension funding and the return on assets it could drive, I think at the 1% level, I think, Rob, that would probably drive maybe a couple of hundred million dollars of funding in the 2020 time frame. We've talked previously about having 0 contributions in both '19 and '20. I think we're now seeing probably a little bit of a required contribution in 2020, which by the way, we did not have when we first came out with the $7 billion in both of those years. So I think we'll be able to offset -- more than offset that going forward and still maintain the $7 billion we said even with the now $200 million or so of contribution.","Operator","The next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Marillyn, just a question from a corporate risk standpoint. I think if we were to go back several years, the expectation was that F-35 would maybe get to 20%, 25% of total sales. It seems like it's marching higher than that. I'm just wondering at what point in terms of its contribution to revenue or earnings it would become unacceptably big just in terms of contribution to the total company?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, first of all, I don't think it growing in sales is unacceptably big to the corporation, but we like to see it continue to sell all around the world as we've said. We like to see it go the way of the F-16, which, as you know, we've sold over 4,500 aircraft around the world. And today the F-35 program of record is around 3,200, so we hope to see it to continue to grow at that level. I understand your question, though, it being a large element of the corporation. And it really is a program that has -- if you look at it, it's not a single customer and has broad-based support. It's a global product, so not only do we have the domestic customers across fleet services, but we have today with 9 international -- 8 international partners and the 3 FMS customers and many more. They're making the decision on their fighter aircraft procurements that I think they will find the best choice is the F-35, hopefully. It's going to continue to sell and it's broad-based. So even though it is a big program relatively speaking, when you consider the customer base, it's -- I think that helps mitigate the risk. In addition to that, we're seeing a lot of -- yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we're seeing a lot of growth in all elements of our business. So every business area contributed to the growth for this quarter and for our outlook for the year, and we'll continue to see growth. We've got a lot of new programs across the business, and they will help to likewise mitigate the risk of one single program. So I feel very comfortable, and I'd like to see the F-35 sales continue to grow.","Greg Gardner","Well, John, thank you very much. We're actually a little bit past the hour. With that, I'll turn it over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. I'll conclude the call today. And I want to conclude just by reiterating that the corporation had another strong quarter, and we consider ourselves very well positioned to deliver growth and substantial value to our customers and our stockholders as we progress towards the successful closure of 2018 and as we look ahead into 2019. So I want to thank you all again for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes the call for today.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Jerry F. Kircher, III","Thank you, Aly, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law.

Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, I want to offer congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their outstanding performance that enabled the achievement of strong first quarter operational and financial results while operating in a dynamic and challenging environment. Their focus and efforts have our corporation poised for continued success in delivering solutions to customers and value to shareholders.","While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later on in the call, I would highlight some noteworthy financial performance in the quarter that included: Growth and earnings per share to $2.33, 15% above last year\u2019s first quarter level; expansion of segment operating margin to 12.1%, achieving an increase of 20 basis points above last year\u2019s level; and generation of $2.1 billion in cash from operation. Our continued strong cash flow is key to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders for share repurchases and dividend payments.","In the first quarter, we repurchased over 5 million shares of stock for approximately $460 million and paid slightly under $400 million in dividends. These combined cash deployment actions returned over $830 million to shareholders in the quarter.","We continue to execute our strategy through solid performance on our corporate business and by winning key competitors and follow-on awards to extend our franchise programs. We also expanded our international business activities and continued our measured pursuit and exploration into adjacent new businesses.","Let me begin with a brief summary of our key order bookings in the quarter. Noteworthy awards included Aeronautics receipt of an IDIQ award on the F-22 program for a 10 year fleet modernization and extension under the Raptor enhanced development and integration program, with the potential value of almost $7 billion, and over eight long refunds for 29 new F-35 aircraft to the U.S. government. Additionally, we were awarded funds for long-lead acquisition of four F-35 aircraft for Japan.","Mission Systems and Training received $700 million for two additional Littoral Combat Ships increasing our LCS work backlog to six vessels. And our Aegis team successful won a competitive award for the Combat Systems Engineering Agent program. This award extends our multi-decade legacy and leadership on this important missile defense system.","Finally, our Space Systems team win a long-lead contract to begin construction of two additional spacecraft on the Cerberus Military Satellite Program for the U.S. Air Force. This award brings our backlog to four spacecraft and on this critical national program that provides worldwide Early Warning Detection of Ballistic Missile launches. These new awards and our backlog of future work are direct indicators of the closed alignment of our portfolio of products with customer strategic priorities and requirements and serve as a foundation for the future.","Turning to operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional focus and skill in providing critical services and products to customers. While the quarter contained numerous accomplishments, I\u2019d like to highlight two notable successes and provide a brief update on F-35 key events.","First as part of the national strategy to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region, our Littoral Combat Ship, The USS Freedom began its deployment to Southeast Asia. We are extremely proud to have our ship chosen to do the inaugural deployment of LCS class vessels to Southeast Asia. It is a testament to the maturity and capabilities of our innovative multi-mission ship and we look forward to her contributions to the seventh fleet.","While visiting leaders have specific command this quarter, I had the opportunity to go on board freedom, while she was docked in Pearl Harbor en route to Southeast Asia. The pride of the crew and their ship and her capabilities was inspirational and only service to reinforce our critical role to provide these revolutionary warships to the navy.","The next key operational achievement was accomplished by our Space Systems business with their successful launch of the second SBIRS satellite for the U.S. Air Force. I had the privilege to be at the launch site in Florida in March with our customer to watch the event. This satellite joins the currently deployed SBIRS spacecraft and expands the constellation of Early Warning Missile Detection satellite. In this era of increasing proliferation, a Ballistic Missile threats from rogue nations SBIRS provides vital intelligence and defense warning to our country and allies. We are honored to be providing these critical national assets to our country and look forward to delivering the remaining four satellites in our backlog.","Moving to F-35, key accomplishments in the quarter were deployment of C-12 Aircraft to Nellis Air Force Base for operational testing and evaluation and completion of the first operational mission conduced by Air Force pilots. The first operational short take-off vertical landing at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, successful completion of the 3-Year Wing Flutter Testing Program on the C-12 version with clean results and the first night time vertical landing of Starbow aircraft at Patuxent River Naval Air Station.","These accomplishments highlight the increasing maturity of the program. We are providing increasing levels of aircraft capability and performance to the multiple service branches to enable expansion of pilot training and operational evaluation of this revolutionary platform.","I\u2019d like to now turn to the status of DoD budgets. Since we last spoke in January, the President signed into law, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013. This act extended funding for the operations of all federal agencies through September 30, 2013. It included full-year appropriations for defense, military construction and veterans\u2019 affairs. This continued resolution will fund all other government agencies at last year\u2019s level.","With the approved FY13 DoD appropriations of $527 billion, our key programs continue to be supported and funded under the full-year appropriation. Examples of that support we\u2019re seeing with the appropriations increasing C-130J procurement to 16 aircraft from previously planned level of seven, and spending of almost $400 million for the continuation of the Meets program. However, funding appropriated through this act remains subject to the automatic budget cuts outlined under sequestration.","We are encouraged by recent alternative budget proposals offered by various members of Congress to modify or eliminate the level of DoD budget reductions required under current sequestration. One version proposes no additional budget reductions to Defense budget levels, while another version proposes approximately $250 billion of reduction from Defense over the next 9 years. Adoption of either of these competing budget versions would represent a significant improvement over the current $500 billion in budget cuts required under sequestration.","Beyond FY13 actions, the President submitted his fiscal year 2014 budget proposal earlier this month. The proposed level for the baseline FY14 defense budget was outlined at $526 billion, a level essentially equal to the current FY13 appropriations level. Initial insight into program priorities contained in the President\u2019s FY14 request showed strong alignment in budget support for a number of our key programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Littoral Combat Ship, missile defense systems and higher quantities of C-130J aircraft.","It should be noted that the FY14 proposed budget does not account for the implications of sequestration that went into effect in March 2013. The impact of sequestration on our business has been minimal to date and Bruce will provide some modeling sensitivity on our 2013 financial outlook of sequestration in FY13.","Turning to the global security environment, rising tensions and threats on the Korean peninsula coupled with ongoing conflict and instability in the Middle East only reinforce the complexity of maintaining global security, a need for a spectrum of flexible and effective products to help maintain global security is growing more acute each day. Lockheed Martin products are foundational assets in the preservation of global security.","Recent deployment of our products by the Department of Defense into the Southeast Asia region include placing F-22 fighters in South Korea and deploying the THAAD missile defense systems on Guam, The Littoral Combat Ship with the 7th fleet, and Aegis Missile Defense System. These deployments highlight the key strategic value and determine capabilities of our unparalleled products to national defense. Our portfolio remains in direct alignment with this global security mission and we look forward to providing critical defense and security solutions to domestic and international customers.","I want to turn briefly to our focus and activity with the international customers this quarter. Expansion of international revenues remains a key component of our corporate strategy and we are on a path to grow international sales from approximately 17% of total revenues last year to at least 20% in the next few years. As we\u2019ve outlined previously, key drivers of that expected growth will be higher levels of international work on the F-35 with growing levels of aircraft deliveries to our partner countries, plus C-130J aircraft, F-16 aircraft and missile defense solutions such as THAAD and Aegis.","Direct and country interaction and listening to the needs of customers are essential components to successful international relationship building. This quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with key customers in Israel, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Italy. Discussion centered on how our corporation can help them with their diverse spectrum of security needs that range from fighter aircraft to missile defense systems to cyber security.","While in Saudi Arabia we inaugurated our new in-country headquarters that will enable development of partnerships to create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace and security sectors. A common theme of the meetings was we universally held believe that the global security environment is only becoming more complex and there is a wide spread desire to utilize many of our products and leading edge solutions to solve their most critical requirements.","Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our financial performance, I want to close my comments by providing some insight into three emerging technologies and adjacent pursuits of the corporation. As we have outlined in the past, one of the new technologies we are examining is in the sustainable and alternative energy generation field through a process called ocean thermal energy conversion or OTEC. This technology uses the temperature variations of ocean depth layers to power thermal exchange equipment and generate electricity.","We have created unique intellectual property and expertise in thermal exchange and recently signed a memorandum of understanding to utilize our intellectual property and begin exploration of the design feasibility of a plant to generate electricity on a commercial scale. This agreement is expected to lead a contract that will fund our development efforts for 10-megawatt pilot plant anticipated to be located of the coast of Southern China. We were excited about the potential future prospects of this technology to generate, clean, renewable electricity.","The second adjacent market I\u2019ll give you an update on is our expanding commercial aircraft pilot training activities using simulators from our Sim-Industries business, that develops and manufactures full-motion and fixed-based civil aviation flight simulators for airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide. As a leader in commercial simulators for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft, Sim recently extended this product line with simulators for the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 aircraft.","Sim industries broad product offering enabled us to offer a very affordable training solution to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s next generation KC-46 Tanker Program. These growing activities and opportunities in this area demonstrate the synergies that exist between the unique low-cost commercial offerings from Sim industries and their applications to future DoD programs. The air force is currently evaluating competitive bids for pilot training on the KC-46 Tanker with the decision on the winning bidder expected later this year.","The third new business opportunity area I\u2019ll highlight has recently emerged from our advanced material studies group and is in the area of water purification. We recently received a patent for Perforene material, which is a molecular filtration solution designed to provide clean potable water. The Perforene membrane features holes that are one nanometer or less in a graphing sheet and are small enough to trap sodium, chlorine and other ions from sea water while dramatically improving the flow through of water molecules. This flow through was 100 times better than current reverse osmosis systems, making it more effective at desalination at a fraction of the cost.","Access to clean drinking water is becoming more critical as the global population continues to grow. We believe that this simple and affordable solution has a potential to be a game changer for the water industry. We are also investigating other applications for Perforene such as biopharmaceutical separations and removal of chemical substances and compounds from water used oil and gas wells. The pursuits I\u2019ve highlighted today are only a few of innovative and expanding portfolio of intellectual property and products that offer future growth prospects for this corporation. We will keep you apprised of our progress in these areas.","I\u2019ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our financial performance and then we\u2019ll open up the line for questions. Bruce?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s start with chart 3, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion, down slightly from last year but ahead of our expectations at the beginning of this year.","Segment operating margin was strong at 12.1%, a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter last year. Our earnings per share were $2.33, up 15% from last year. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and we repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter. So I think we are off to a good start in 2013.","Chart 4 shows our sales for the first quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautic sales decreased by about 14% compared with last year. However, this was slightly better than our expectations when we spoke in January as we had higher aircraft deliveries than planned in the quarter.","Our sales in the other four business areas were also stronger than expected particularly in Missiles and Fire Control, which also benefited from additional product deliveries and volume in the quarter. I should point out that with the implementation of sequestration delayed until March 1, we saw minimal impact for the quarter but would expect that impact to grow as we move forward. I\u2019ll discuss sequestration in greater detail in subsequent charts.","Moving to chart 5 in our first quarter segment operating results, our segment operating profit was comparable to last year\u2019s level with the increase in margin offsetting the impact of lower sales in the quarter. We continue to have strong program execution and are taking appropriate cost reduction actions as needed. Turning to chart 6 on earnings per share, EPS in the quarter was 15% higher than a year-ago driven primarily by the lower pension expense as a result of our contributions at the end of last year and the benefits of the R&D tax credit.","You remember that we mentioned on the last call that the first quarter would have the benefit of the full-year 2012 credit as well as the 2013 first quarter credit and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here. On pension adjusted basis, our EPS grew to $2.56 in the quarter.","On the chart 7, we\u2019ll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. As expected, our cash flow in the quarter was very strong at nearly $2.1 billion, more than $1.5 billion higher than the level last year. Although last year\u2019s level was reduced by roughly $500 million pension contribution. We not only had strong operational performance, but also had the benefit of a $540 million tax refund in the quarter, resulting from our pension contributions at the end of last year.","We expect that cash generated this quarter will be the highest for the year as we have both pension contributions and tax payments plan in future quarters that did not occur on the first quarter. On chart 8, we\u2019ll discuss our cash returned to shareholders. We returned over $800 million to shareholders this quarter through our share repurchases and industry leading dividend yield. The level of share repurchases was almost doubled what we did in the first quarter last year and dividends were higher as a result of our 15% increase last September.","Moving onto chart 9, we\u2019ll discuss our updated view of the guidance, we provided on the last call. You recall that our January guidance did not consider the impacts of sequestration. Since then, sequestration did become effective on March 1, but as I said earlier, its implementation had minimal impact on our performance this quarter. Unless revised by Congress however we would expect to see the effect of sequestration having impact throughout the rest of this year.","We try to model these potential impacts by assuming a peanut butter spread of expected reductions to our U.S. government business awarded with FY13 funds. Or said differently, we do not assume any flexibility on our customers\u2019 part to favor one programs budget over another.","Using that approach, we estimate a potential $825 million impact to our sales in 2013. With the strong results of each of our five business areas in the first quarter though, we believe our current sales outlook remains within the guidance range we\u2019ve provided in January and I\u2019ll explain that in more detail on the next chart.","Chart 10 shows the methodology we use to develop our estimate of the impact of sequestration on our 2013 sales. At the mid point of our guidance, we would expect just over a three quarters of our sales or about $35 billion to be generated from our year end 2012 backlog and we would expect sales to non-U.S. government customers from orders received this year to be around $2 billion or so, neither of these amounts is expected to be directly impacted by sequestration, however our original estimate of $8.25 billion of U.S. government sales from new orders this year is expected to be impacted by sequestration. As we modeled the estimated impacts over the next three quarters, we project the reduction of around $825 million in sales primarily impacting IS&GS and MST.","On chart 11, we provide our updated guidance. Assuming the modeling from the previous chart and factoring in our better than planned results in the first quarter, we now expect sales will be near the lower end of our guidance range. Even with the lower sales expectation, we are maintaining our side with operating profit and cash guidance reflecting our growing confidence on our performance for the rest of 2013 and we are maintaining our earnings per share guidance range of $8.80 to $9.10 that will emphasize that this range does not include restructuring charges if any associated with sequestration as they are unpredictable at this time.","And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. The first quarter represents the strong start to the year with better than expected sales volume and strong segment operating profit and cash from operations. These results continued for a quite strong program execution, the proactive cost reduction measures we\u2019re taking and the strength of our portfolio. And we continue to focus on actions and create value for our customers and our shareholders.","With that, we\u2019re ready for your questions, Aly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Thanks, good morning and good performance.","Bruce L. Tanner","","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Marillyn, I actually had a question for you on the extensive comments you gave on the non-defense portion of your business, which is small. But it seems like you\u2019re targeting quite a bit for growth, and really just from two angles, one because as you know this has been a tough thing for defense companies to doing the path to diversify during a downturn.","So the two questions are, one, in your approach to the market, how are you orient in the company to really to impact commercial markets, which is really a bit of difficult thing for companies to do? And I just mean the difference in the customer base relative to the government did some I guess comments there will be good. And then secondly from a risk standpoint, what kind of capital are you putting at risk and how are you considering that going forward? Thanks.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks for the question, Joe. This first half I would say the things that you are seeing coming forward are things that we\u2019ve been investing in for a number of years. As a company we are a technology leader, we often talk about saying that we do hard stuff, we do difficult things and try to work on big things that are affecting the global environment, the global security environment. So we are always investing in the future in that regard.","And we have 60,000 scientists and engineers that are working on things not only on our core products and services today, but also looking at ways to give our adversaries and advantage or look at new areas that we can help in global security needs. So even as our customer budgets decline, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in these new technology so we think that\u2019s really important that we do that.","In terms of [ordering] as to commercial markets, I would say that the things that we\u2019re doing right now are things that \u2013 as I said we\u2019ve been investing in for sometime and while it is a different customer base they are large projects much like we do large projects across the corporation.","And so to the risk, these are not big needle movers in the near term. We are not looking at a large cash investment we\u2019ve been investing, for example, the Perforene and the nanotechnologies for the past seven years. We\u2019ve been investing in the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion. We\u2019ve been working on since the 70s. We increased our investment in past five years, but it\u2019s measured and disciplined investment that we make in R&D just as we do across the business.","So from that standpoint, it\u2019s a matter of not putting any capital at risk, but that we do expect these to be fully funded. In fact, if you look at OTEC, that final plant will be fully funded by our partner as we bring our intellectual property forward in that arena. And in terms of the Perforene, we got a patent, but we are now looking for opportunities to partner and taking that one forward. So we partnered with companies in the commercial market that\u2019s what gives us the capability to go into those new markets and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach them.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","","Good morning.","","Marillyn A. Hewson","","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Marillyn and Bruce a very nice quarter; if I could just go back to the sequester discussion for a moment, I was going to ask Bruce if you could give us a little bit more color on why we don\u2019t see more of an earnings or margin impact from the lower sales or is it simply that\u2019s what embedded in the range. And then more specifically, Bruce on your modelling discussion you talked about peanut buttering the GFY-13 funding that impacts this year. But what percentage of GFY funding for Lockheed is beyond 2013. I would imagine with the long cycle nature of your product lines, it could be a large percentage?","Bruce L. Tanner","","Yeah. So let me try to address both those questions, Rob. So why profit and cash are not necessarily impacted or why we didn\u2019t change the guidance for those two elements. First is we did do for sales. You know a lot of it is because of the first quarter quite honestly and obviously we were higher in the first quarter for sales as well but we had good results, pretty much across the board. All five business areas are planned for them in terms of both sales and operating profit. I think as we look forward for the next three quarters, we do expect to see some pressures for the reasons that I described from sequestration.","As I said earlier that not played out at this point. But we do expect them to happen in the next three quarters. As we look out for the planned risk retirements and what we\u2019ve accomplished in the first quarter, we think those are stronger as we said here today but maybe we thought that be at the start of this year and that\u2019s the reason, we didn\u2019t change the profit guidance.","Cash flow, obviously, $2.1 billion in the first quarter, very strong, stronger than we had expected honestly and that\u2019s the other reason why we think that\u2019s going to carry after the rest of this year as well, that\u2019s the reason we didn\u2019t come down off of our cash as well.","I think your second question was, so how much of the FY13 carries over in for next year? I made the comment, Rob that the sales we got from our backlog at the end of 2012 was about 77%. So think of that is new, see the FY, our calendar year 2013 sales originating 77% of which come from the 2012 backlog, that\u2019s not an unusual pattern for us at all. I\u2019ll say next year, we would expect it to look very similar to that.","So you should think of that as probably 25-ish may be a little less than that percent of our sales in 2014, will need to come from orders received in 2014 and manifested into sales in 2014. So that pattern as I look back over time has been a fairly consistent one, not at all unusual for what we\u2019re experiencing in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Rob.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","A quick question on capital deployment, do you expect that to be more consolidation in the defense industry as we see [the year] is playing out and would you see Lockheed being participating in that? And also to follow-on from your comments Marillyn about these adjacent markets, would you potentially be interested in acquisitions in line with more diversified areas, not just defense?","Marillyn A. Hewson","In terms of consolidations on the defense industry, I think you know as the spending contracts, we would expect that there would be more consolidation, it\u2019s just at that level and it\u2019s been communicated to us by our customers, I think that at the prime level, it\u2019s about right in terms of the number of companies that are prime, so we\u2019re probably get to second and third tier or below but we will see consolidation. But I certainly expect that because the economics will dictate that with the contraction of the budgets.","In terms of acquisitions and to broadening our acquisitions, we\u2019re going to stay into the near adjacencies. We prefer to do joint ventures and teaming where it makes sense and we\u2019ll continue to look at our acquisition strategy as String of Pearls approach and look at what will line up with the capability that we need and the markets that we want to moved into.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug S. Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Doug.","Doug S. Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I\u2019d like to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the longer-term top-line outlook, because on one hand if I look at the backlog so to say played out in this quarter, it means, as I look at it, IS and GS appear to the most worried sum in that, obviously you could get it by sequestration. When you talk about contraction, it\u2019s in the budget.","It sounds like you are looking at a shrinkage overall in your top-line and if I pair that up against the new ventures you\u2019re talking about going into, I mean I know that OTEC and the reverse osmosis purification program, this were going on 15 years ago. Are you looking at reading those forward more as a substitute for a contraction in the defense revenues? So, if something happen technologically that\u2019s caused us to lead forward and become a more prominent effort.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks for the question, Doug. Just to address, where we see our growth, we do know that our core domestic defense business will flatten, potentially decline. So what we are focused on is growing our international business that is where we expect that to offset that and continue to grow.","As I\u2019ve said in previous calls and today as well we are currently at 17% of our sales. We expect to grow that to 20% over the next few years, but we will continue to focus on where that demand is from missile defense or [attack area] or immobility, a lot of our C4ISR satellite technology. It\u2019s a whole range of products, but it continues to be a strong demand for internationally. In terms of these adjacencies and some that I talked about today, these are not needle movers in the near term.","These are really those that we believe are long-term with large application potentially in these technologies and they are not new to the horizon for us. As I said, we have been working on them for a number of years. The fact that some of them have come to fruition, we are dealing with different partners and different customers and so they are once that have come about in the last few months that have come on the screen and we thought it would be appropriate to share with you what is happening in those, but our top line growth will be on our core and near adjacencies both domestically and internationally in the business.","Bruce L. Tanner","Doug, I might add just a little bit. I think on your last question you asked about the technology aligned at this point in time and I think that\u2019s probably a fair characterization. I think they have aligned here. We\u2019ve been experimenting with some of the early materials that led up to the Propane products for probably the last seven years or so through our advanced materials organization and that is \u2013 what\u2019s just come out here, I think at the end of 2012 is where the product that we think provides us sort of capability that we\u2019ve described with Perforene On the OTEC side, as Marillyn said earlier, we\u2019ve been doing that literally since the 1970s.","We actually had a pilot plant in Hawaii, off the Coast of Hawaii, that\u2019s been working as much, much smaller scale than the one we\u2019re talking about, building going forward, we\u2019ve had that operating for probably the last five years or so. So, some of the technologies has come together, some has just been ability to scale those technologies, particularly in the OTEC side of it. And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s sort of the combination have been coincidentally they\u2019re all sort of materializing here at the same time; frankly, very opportune time for us, because that\u2019s where we are seeing some pressure with our largest domestic customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi Investment Research","All right, good morning everyone.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Good morning.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Just a clarification question and then a more medium one, on the adjacencies, can you talk about where you are from the percentage of revenue today and what your targets are? And then, is this a question of potentially selling these intellectual property rights, which you developed here?","And then on the needy question Bruce can you talk a little bit about the cadence for cash for the rest of the year giving all the moving pieces with the pension contribution, the tax payments. And then, we also like think you have got the DoD moving from net pay of 15 days and 29 days, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s going to have any impact on the cadence of the cash for the rest of the year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yeah, Jason, good question. Let me try, I\u2019ll answer both and see if Marillyn wants to add anything to what I would come up with. So on the adjacencies how big, you should think of this being fairly small, may be literally as below 5% of our overall sales right now, we\u2019re hoping to grow that some going forward, the biggest elements we\u2019ve got right now are in our energy business as well as our cyber security business, and those are two that we\u2019ve talked about fairly consistently on the calls. You should think of those as again being tough, I\u2019ll say low single digits percent of the overall sales in the corporation not into growth those going forward.","The products that Marillyn described in her prepared remarks, will just add to that but not significantly I\u2019ll say over the next five-year period of time. We are just really trying to convey the message that we like to think and we do difficult in all these projects that we are talking about have difficult in their middle name if nothing else, and we think we are riding our capabilities and the innovative capabilities of our workforce with products or with problems that need to be solved on a big scale and that\u2019s what we are trying to see it for you.","As far as the cadence for the cash, I\u2019m glad you asked that and I hoping to work that at some point of conversation anyway, so obviously we are not going to do $2 billion a quarter when we are out looking $4 billion for the year. You should think we had no pension contributions and a tax refund in the first quarter of this year. We should be \u2013 over the next three quarters we should have pension payments in the second quarter and third quarter. We\u2019ll actually had two tax payments just the way the calendar lines up in the second quarter and then the tax payments in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","So what you should see especially in the second quarter is we will have cash flow down considerably, I mean probably to the point of on a free cash flow basis slightly better than positive we\u2019re hoping but down its pretty significantly. And then I would expect it to grow up to the $800 million, $900 million in the last two quarters or so is what the expectation as we said here.","You\u2019ve asked about the payment cycle and so forth. And I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ve and I think the industry in large are seeing actually pretty good performance out of payment officers where we get the most the bulk of our collections from our customer. They\u2019ve been paying typically quicker than sort of the statutory rates that have been paid in the past.","What I am watching for going forward in particular, Jason is the effects of workforce furloughs on the part of the U.S. government and particularly is that affects our paying officers. And so you can imagine a scenario where people will be furlough, I think the current pick in the government is one day for 14 weeks in the months ahead.","And the question is so, is everyone paying contractors sufficient in four days as they are in five, I got to believe that\u2019s not going to be the case. I will say though that\u2019s expected to be an impact in the fiscal year and not necessary for the calendar year, because obviously the fiscal year went in September and we would expect that the next calendar not to had those sorts of furloughs of leases we said here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Safran \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Richard Safran \u2013 Buckingham Research","I wanted to ask you about book-to-bill. So if I did it right, looks like a book-to-bill of roughly 0.6. And I think that\u2019s about what you did one quarter last year? So I thought maybe you could comment on expectations for book-to-bill this year and how you feel about full-year book-to-bill being either one times or higher?","Bruce L. Tanner","","Yeah, I\u2019ll try that one Rich. So I think your math is right. It was a 0.6 book-to-bill. Actually as we look at the first quarter orders, we actually did better than we expected to do, pretty much across the board for orders for all our business areas. And in particular, I will say, I think that is one of the reasons why some of our short cycle businesses like IS & GS and sort of the services component of MST actually faired better in sales in the first quarter because we did actually receive slightly higher orders in the quarter than we\u2019d expected to.","Going forward, I think second quarter is going to be the lowest quarter from a backlog perspective of the year and then we would expect it to rise thereafter. So we expect second half orders to be higher than first half and the fourth quarter to be the highest quarter of all the quarters if you will. And that\u2019s our typical pattern anyway. There is a couple of things I\u2019ll point to that you might be watching out for in the second quarter.","We have a few high dollar items, mostly within our large business areas. So we would expect to get at the second order for close, the second order for 18 aircraft for S-16 aircraft I should say for Iraq, probably get in order for couple of C-130s from Saudi Arabia. There is a possibility we\u2019ll close on the Indian C-130 a second and C1-30 by for India for six aircraft. We still have six international aircraft and launch six for F-35 that yet to be sort of fully funded via under an undefinitized contractual action or UCA that we would hope would happen in the second quarter.","We should get additional funding for even greater aircraft on LRIP-8, for F-35. And then switching to MST, we should be getting finalization of the MH-60 Denmark helicopter contract and some ground radar business within MST. So those are sort of the dollar awards that you want to watch the high dollar awards.","Strategically, there is a couple of big items as well, almost all of them within MST in the second quarter. So the Air Missile Defense Radar AMDR program, we expect to be awarded in the second quarter as was space side, this is the sort of the Space Debris Tracking radar if you will from earth that we expect to happen in the second quarter.","And then lastly within MST, the KC-46 Training activity that Marillyn mentioned in her prepared remarks is also something that we would expect to happen. Either late in the second quarter, early third, the rest of the year, we are hopeful obviously we got some missile defense products pack reason for a number of customers within the Middle East.","And then recently if you saw some of the FMS activity just came out, we are hopeful to have some weapons on F-15s and some capabilities for helicopters in Saudi Arabia as well as the potential to sell additional F-16s to the UAE. So whether that one will happen between now and end of the year, it might be a little bit sporty but we\u2019re focused on that and hopeful that that could occur. I should mention probably that we\u2019ve also got activities within Singapore and South Korea for the F-35; again, not sure if those will happen this year or not, but they are on the custom, ones that we\u2019re watching very closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Yes. Good morning, Bruce.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, George.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","One little one and then one I\u2019ll put together. You mentioned a contractual settlement on the F-16 in the quarter. Could you kind of ballpark, how big that was? And then a macro question is if you look at historically defense outlays and track them against military contractors very rarely does the military contractors vary a heck of a lot from the numbers, and if you look at 2014, the outlays for procurement in R&D probably going to be down at least 10%. So I guess I asked the question why won\u2019t your revenues be down similar to what you would expect\u2026","Bruce L. Tanner","Yeah, so George, I\u2019ll take those. So F-16 the contractual resolution you should think of that being in and nothing sure to approach 10, but think of it in the 10ish million dollar range maybe little less than that. So not a particularly huge item, but one that\u2019s been outstanding for quite a while and we\u2019re delighted to have and finally settle now; I literally think this is one that is probably been around. As I have quite a few of these contractual resolutions, we have had settled in the past for probably close to a decade. So it is good to get them behind us.","As far as the outlays, you\u2019re looking at the defense outlays versus the contractor, you know what, I will remind you again that 61% of our sales roughly last year were from the DoD. So there is a full almost 40% that\u2019s non-DoD, obviously the biggest component that is the international, we do expect as Marillyn said earlier to grow the international component of our business which would help to maybe explain why we don\u2019t get down to 10% you are talking about there.","And then what I would suggest George is that, even within that reduction in the procurement R&D, you have to look at the individual programs within the DoD budget because not every partner within the DoD budget is going down 10% and it ties into the priorities of the customer and our alignment of our portfolio with those priorities.","So we would expect the F-35 to grow our air and missile defense programs to grow and help to offset that on the international side obviously as we mentioned earlier, the air and missile defense components especially growing over the next few years. It helps to offset that reduction. I think you\u2019re seeing in the \u2013 and sort of the high level map that you described.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Thank you. I want to ask more of an operational question and for example if we look at aeronautics, Marillyn, you were able to hold the decline, for example on the C-130 to about $10 million, despite seeing a $175 million decline in revenues, which is pretty impressive sort of action.","And, if we look across some of the other businesses despite, difficult revenue numbers, the margins were pretty darn good. Could you talk a little bit about with some detail on some of the things you\u2019re doing whether it\u2019s head count or for space and you know, because no matter what happens with the sequester. I think there is just going to be a real utmost pressure on the business for a while?","Marillyn A. Hewson","","Howard, we\u2019re definitely focused on operational performance, so I think you characterize it well in terms of talking about it being operational because we\u2019ve been, we not only are we driving improvement even if we reduce the rate on the C-130J, we are able to hold our position relative to profit on the program.","So, I think you\u2019re seeing the results of that and at the same time, we\u2019re very much across our business, working on reducing cost and increasing efficiencies and productivity in the business; so a lot of activities, not just operationally with our particular program but all of that flows through to all of our programs.","So the things that we\u2019re doing in getting out of facilities and reducing our overheads and the efficiencies that come with, just having a razor focus on cost across every element of the business is helping us to bring in better performance. And then within the C-130J, I mean as it moves through its courses you have a learning curve and so continuing to have productivity improvements as we continue with the rate of that program.","Bruce L. Tanner","Howard, just a interesting little [titbits] there. And my aeronautics friends have pointed this off to me as we\u2019ve done reviews with Marillyn and the leadership team there. We\u2019ve actually for the past few C-130 since we\u2019ve started building at 24 aircraft a year, the hourly rate or the hours it takes to assemble that C-130 is we\u2019re actually performing better than we were \u2013 when we were delivering 34 aircrafts a year.","So that\u2019s no small feat when you are on number what 4500 aircraft, not 4500, 2500 aircraft through the line, and at this stage of the product development or product manufacturing cycle that we\u2019ve been able to make that those are real live reductions and it\u2019s one of several instances that we can point to there, we\u2019re taking the right actions particularly on a manufacturing side of bringing down the product cost in line with the shrinking volume that we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Thanks, good morning. First one is a classification, Bruce I think you had previously talked about $8 billion in backlog and in the year and can\u2019t recall that was with sequestration without and if that number had changed?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, so Myles, I think what I have tried to key up is that we always expect that we take a downturn in the first quarter, probably get further down a second quarter, I think at the start of the year, I said we hope to get back around the $80 billion mark that still obviously a goal that we have, but I think it\u2019s going to be tougher assuming that the next three quarters are hit by sequestration. So those numbers, you remember them right, it was $80 billion. But I\u2019ll say that\u2019s probably a tougher \u2013 as we said here today because that did not compare the effects of sequestration.","And of course we would think that orders in the fiscal year since we had more of our orders obviously coming from that fiscal year 2013 funds would be more significantly impacted them with sales in calendar year 2013, because less of those come from fiscal year 2013 fund.","So it would be a bigger number than the $825 million of sales impact is what I would expect from an orders perspective. But we\u2019re not yet at this point giving up on that and hopefully as quarter\u2019s go by, I also have a better idea what that looks like and we\u2019ll be able to update that for you as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","Yes, thank you and great performance.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thank you.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","Bruce, one of the things you highlighted was that EACs were better than expected. It was 470, 35% of sales, that\u2019s substantially higher than it\u2019s been in any of the last couple of years. Where do you expect it to be for the year? And two questions, give us some color on the quarterly pattern as you did with the cash flow? And then where notionally can this number go in the future as it likely to come down than more normal levels or is it still sustainable? Thanks so much.","Bruce L. Tanner","","(inaudible). So EACs at least as I look at Cai, we actually we\u2019re a little bit lower in terms of profit adjustments in the first quarter of this year as compared to what we did last year. So think of it, still in the sort of mid 30-ish range, but slightly less I think about $15 million bucks or $20 million bucks less this year versus last year.","U.S. for sort of the pattern going forward, we would expect to be within probably the 30% to 35% range each and every quarter going forward probably down a little bit from last year overall, but of course the sales and the segment profit are expected to be down this year compared to last year, so that\u2019s probably following suite for the lower volumes that you see there.","Nothing really jumps out as I look at it as far as spikiness as we sit here today in terms of the pattern going forward, that obviously changes as we do risk retirements, we do them when we retire the risk not when we necessarily plan to do the risk. So when I describe the pattern going forward, it\u2019s when we plan to do but we can obviously do better or worse than that.","We really don\u2019t have a reason to believe to the future necessarily going to look any differently in the past. I know that\u2019s been the subject of a lot of riding but it is the same methodology we\u2019ve used consistently for a long, long time and that has been our pattern. We\u2019ve got to describe that over time, I think last year was the best odd in a couple of quarters because we had some large contractual resolutions that sort of jumped up that were are not in our historical levels. But going forward what we see is still sort of in that 30% to 35% range and not much change for that, Cai von.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","","And then you mentioned that it was better than you expected, how much has that changed? You mentioned that was a plus for the full year to offset the lower sales. Is that how much better does it look now approximately?","Bruce L. Tanner","I don\u2019t know I have got the numbers at the top of my head, Cai. But I would say we were not expecting. We got the benefit of both volume obviously. I mean I think on the last call I teed up that we are probably going to be down a billion dollars year-over-year in the first quarter. We ended up being down what about $800 million. We again across the board, all five business areas were better in sales, better in profit.","The sales obviously brought volume in terms of profit on those sales. If I had to get some number out, probably offset maybe about 50-ish plus million dollars is probably what I would guess that happened earlier and somewhat higher than we had expected kind and that\u2019s a little bit off the top of my head and we\u2019ll see what that looks like going forward. But again I don\u2019t see a huge pattern shipped as we go forward in the next three quarters from what we did in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, David.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Bruce, going through your sequestration map as it relates to 2014, is there anything besides international that would offset overall revenues potentially being down in the high single digit range? And then Marillyn, a question for you in terms of sizing the business for sequestration, you obviously highlighted here further restructuring of IS&GS. Can you just talk about maybe broadly how you view the business size wise, from a head count perspective if sequestration does go through in full effect? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes. So David, you asked me the first part of that question. So again what I try to key up and I won\u2019t just simply repeat myself but we do tend to have a very similar pattern as far as the amount of sales that we derived from backlog year-over-year. So as we\u2019ve talked in the past, our long cycle businesses, Aeronautics and Space in particular get 90% plus of their in the following year from the backlog from prior years, that goes down. Probably IS and GS is our lowest business that gets in terms of the percentage of sales that are derived from previous years backlog. I think about, that\u2019s probably 65-ish percent or so, 35% comes from new orders turning into new sales in the year.","The thing about 2014 that I think we all have to remember is, 2013 is the peanut butter or across the board cuts. 2014 with the new President\u2019s budget, there is no peanut butter cut, so they can actually cut whatever \u2013 I\u2019ll say aligned with the strategy starting in government fiscal year 2014, that\u2019s different then what we saw or what we will see in fiscal year 2013 and where I would offer up, this is sort of the proof of the putting or whether or not your portfolio aligns to the government\u2019s strategic interest or not in terms of the DoD\u2019s priorities.","We think ours does \u2013 we think ours has more staying power in that environment than in a peanut butter environment, and that\u2019s what I think, David I think is maybe all that will understood that I think it does make a difference as we look into FY14 versus FY13.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","","Hi, Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson","","So, you address the sizing of the business for sequestration. Now we\u2019re going to size the businesses as we get more clarity from our customer. Frankly it\u2019s difficult to forecast, I know Bruce talked a lot about modeling, but it really was \u2013 the best we could do to model what that impact would be until we get better insight on their planning for sequestration will be difficult to say which programs get hit and therefore which program what kind of head count might be modified accordingly. So, there is a lot of uncertainty here.","As Bruce said though, we look at the budget request for FY2014, it does certainly support not only the national security strategy but it also very much aligns with our portfolio. We\u2019ll continue to invest in new technology, we\u2019ll continue to drive down our cost and I think we remain well positioned to succeed in this environment going forward.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","","Aly, if I could, maybe one last question please.","Operator","","Our final question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Thank you. I said I want to go one in. Hey Bruce, can you discuss a little bit about the sales, before you had said sales for the quarter would be about a $1 billion below and then you came in a little bit better on aircraft deliveries but it looks like almost across the board, MST and MFC, IS & GS space all running ahead of what you said you would be doing in the 10-K in terms of the full-year. So is there a reason why there was so much front ended and what is that mean for the progression of the different quarters?","Bruce L. Tanner","","Yes, good question, Sam. So I try to tee that up, I think what Cai von asked the earlier question that they maybe more higher in the first quarter as expected. I teed up being about a $1 billion down, we actually have been $200 million down, so there is $800 million of goodness there. I think if it is a couple hundred million within Aeronautics probably for a couple of C-130s earlier delivered than planned.","The rest of those volumes, Missile & Fire Control was up on just a percentage basis like 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. Most of that was the facing or timing of deliveries of products there. So think of it is in particular tactical missiles JASSM, missiles the Multiple Launch Rocket System activities there. That\u2019s earlier than planned but not necessarily upper for the year as we look at this at the end of the first quarter.","We also saw higher volume just I\u2019d say cost volume from a couple of awards including within SOF CLS and with the (inaudible) sniper activity with the Missiles and Fire Control. Some of our short cycle business, I\u2019ll say we were very pleasantly surprised in the first quarter, I mentioned earlier that we were going to \u2013 that we actually exceeded our orders expectations in the first quarter even though you\u2019re looking at that as a 0.6 book-to-bill ratio that was actually slightly better than expected. And on our short cycle business, we think that did translate into higher sales in the quarter as well.","So not sure if that was last throughout the year, that\u2019s one of the reasons we put the guidance out that we did, but we\u2019re pleased to have that in fact in the first quarter, I think some of that is because we frankly saw, I\u2019ll say a sense of urgency to get things under contract prior to the end of last year when we thought sequestration was going to start in early January, I think we experienced a similar phenomenon at the end of February when the customer thought that sequestration was going to get in effect on March 1, a number of customers thought that obligated funds would that be subject to sequestration if obligated prior to that.","I think we got bit of a rush to kind of get those under contract, I think we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that on our short cycle businesses. So maybe just to finish off my long dialogue here, but going forward the next few quarters, I think our sales levels are going to be similar in the second quarter and third quarter to what we experienced in the first quarter maybe down slightly, because sequestrations largest impacts at least as we look for the rest of the year going to occur in the second quarter and third quarters, because you\u2019re kind of squeezing the full government\u2019s fiscal year with sequestration cuts into the last two quarters of the fiscal year.","So for us that the second quarter and third quarter of the calendar year, I think we\u2019ll see bigger reductions there, I do think fourth quarter will be the largest quarter of the year going forward even with the potential reductions that have yet to be announced in fiscal year 2014 from sequestration. So that\u2019s sort of how I think of the \u2013 again the next three quarters similar, may be a little bit down, because the sequestration to the first quarter and then a pop up in the fourth quarter.","Marillyn A. Hewson","So to wrap up, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining the call today and for your questions and we look forward to speaking with you in July.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher, III","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I like to remind you the statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to review our third quarter earnings release and financial results. The results directly illustrate the continuation of our strong operational and financial momentum and enabled us to increase our financial outlook for 2013.","The focus and efforts of our Lockheed Martin team continued to position the Corporation for delivery of solutions to customers and value to shareholders. I offer my congratulations and appreciation to all of our employees and especially to those employees directly affected by the government shutdown, for their outstanding achievements and performance while operating in a challenging and dynamic environment. While there were numerous financial accomplishments in the quarter that Bruce will outline in his comments, I want to offer my thoughts on key strategic achievements this quarter.","From my perspective, beyond the program execution and financial results that remain exceptional, other accomplishments can be seen in three key strategic areas. These areas are backlog expansion, international growth and cash generation. We have continued to describe our portfolio as the best positioned in the sector with unique and direct alignment to many of the essential programs identified by customers as they satisfy their national security requirements. Many of our programs have provided these solutions to customers over several decades, because they are proven and they are cost-effective.","Addressed validation of this alignment and positioning of our programs to customers\u2019 needs is visible with our achievement of increased \u2013 increasing levels of annual backlog for the past three years ending with over $82 billion in backlog at year-end 2012, while operating in a challenging global and domestic economic environment. This quarter, our portfolio alignment and product offerings resulted in $15 billion in new orders and expansion of our backlog to nearly $79 billion. We continue to execute on the forecast we outlined to you at the beginning of the year that our backlog expansion would resume in the third quarter. Looking forward, the new business pipeline remains robust with significant domestic and international awards expected later this year on many of our legacy programs.","With the establishment of a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2014 in place through January 15, we remain on the path previously outlined to you, to further expand our backlog in the fourth quarter to a year-end estimate of at least $80 billion. Our ability to continue the expansion of our backlog is strategically important as it helps solidify our business and provide visibility into our future financial outlook. Our strong backlog consisting of multiple years of prior fiscal appropriations driven by our longer cycle production programs provides a level of financial stability and strategic differentiation in this era of potential government budget uncertainty.","Another area within which we achieved significant strategic progress this quarter was in the international business arena. As you recall, we have a stated goal to expand our international sales content to at least 20% of revenues in the next few years. To achieve this goal, we have moved aggressively to build upon our long-standing in-country presence and further strengthen relationships with international countries around the world through partnerships, in-country production, and establishment of in-country joint technology offices. All of these actions are essential to enable expansion of international work for the Corporation.","Financial benefits to the Corporation are increased sales, cash flow, and earnings contribution. Benefits to our customers are increased factory loading and our ability to improve cost through higher production throughput. Specific events furthering our international expansion were seen across multiple business areas this quarter and included finalization of a multibillion dollar award from the United Arab Emirates for our THAAD missile defense system.","This was a significant strategic event with the UAE serving as the inaugural international customer for the THAAD system. Demand for this proven system is only growing and has been expressed by numerous countries from the Asia-Pacific region to the Middle East. Additionally, finalization of our LRIP 6 and 7 contracts on the F-35 program contained a growing component of international work with inclusion of new aircraft awards for Australia, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom.","Looking forward into 2014, Japan and Israel are scheduled to finalize new orders, which would further expand our international backlog. Additional international award can be seen on the near horizon with the Netherlands\u2019 announcement of its first order to procure Joint Strike Fighters for its national defense. We look forward to providing these revolutionary aircraft to one of our key strategic partner countries.","Finally, we were pleased that South Korea plans to reopen the competition for their future fighter program, potentially providing us a new customer opportunity for our fifth generation F-35 Fighter and further growth in international activity. Our international work is expected to grow and help mitigate domestic pressures in 2014 with growth visible and achievable due to our backlog of existing work. Our international expansion is broad based, is happening now, and we feel increasingly confident about our achievement of our stated goal of at least 20% in the near future.","Let me turn to cash flow. Our ability to deliver consistently strong cash flows continues to be a strategic differentiator for our Corporation. The importance of cash is embedded in our corporate DNA. I was pleased that we were able to \u2013 again able to increase our 2013 cash flow outlook this quarter. Our strong and increasing cash flow enables us to invest prudently in the future of the Corporation, in areas such as capital expenditures, and research and development, while also providing the ability to pursue our cash deployment strategy for returns to shareholders in the areas of increasing dividends and share repurchases. We continue to strongly believe in the return of value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As I look forward, our future cash flows are expected to be aided by increasing levels of customer advances from growing international work and recovery of our $8 billion in prior year\u2019s pension contributions. We feel very good about our future cash and the potential for continued strong and increasing cash flows that will position the Corporation to differentiate from competitors.","Before turning the call over to Bruce to cover financials, I wanted to briefly speak about Government budgets. Last week, agreement was reached to implement a continuing resolution to fund FY14 government expenditures through January 15, 2014. This action enabled federal agencies to return to work and eliminated the partial Government shutdown. The agreement also extended the nation\u2019s debt limit authority until February 7, 2014, avoiding a default that could have occurred last week.","Additionally, Congress agreed to conduct conference committee discussions on FY14 budget levels and cost elements with a goal for completion of a budget agreement by December 13, 2013. These actions are a step forward as they enable resumption of full government and contractor operations during the periods outlined. Resumption of normal work is the best path forward to eliminate disruptions to operations, enable cost affordability and savings initiative to progress and provide critical equipment and services to our customers.","There is still much budget work to be done by Congress to address the debt ceiling before February 7 and determine the level of funding for the entire 2014 fiscal year before the continuing resolution expires next January. We continue to urge Congress and the administration to focus on long-term solutions to confront the difficult fiscal issues facing our country and avoid a repeat of the disruption that the nation recently experienced.","As part of those solutions, we also ask that they address and revise the across the board budget reduction policy required under the current sequestration law. This non-strategic allocation of budget reductions is not good for our nation or our national security strategy. With the closure of Government fiscal year 2013, we can now determine that budget reduction action implemented under sequestration will result in a limited impact to our portfolio of programs in 2013, with impacts seen primarily on our shorter cycle business.","Our original estimate of $825 million in potential reduction to revenues was significantly muted due to our large backlog of work remaining unaffected by FY13 budget cuts. This enabled us to refine our revenue outlook for calendar year 2013 to a new guidance value of approximately $45 billion, better than we projected on our July earnings call.","As we look forward into 2014, clearly there is no shortage of possible government budget outcomes. These outcomes range from full implementation of sequestration cuts required under the Budget Control Act to less severe scenarios. These multiple scenarios are challenging to predict. However, with our anticipated strong year-end backlog I spoke to earlier, aided by growing international revenues unaffected by U.S. government budget actions, we are expecting to see mitigation of financial impacts on our Corporation. Accordingly, we are providing initial trend analysis for 2014 that projects our revenues to be only slightly below 2013 levels.","I\u2019ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our 2013 financial performance and 2014 trend analysis, and then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s start with Chart 3 and an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down from last year, but slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating margin continued to be very strong at 12.8% and this strong performance contributed to a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.57 from continuing operations.","We generated $900 million in cash from operations after a $750 million pension contribution. We continued to reward our shareholders with almost $1 billion of cash returned to the repurchase of nearly 5 million shares along with our quarterly dividend payment. As expected, we received $15 billion in orders in the quarter, which brings our backlog to just under $79 billion, and finally due to our operating performance, we increased our 2013 outlook for segment operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations.","Chart 4 shows our sales and segment operating margins for the third quarter this year versus last year. Our sales were 4% lower than last year, but ahead of our expectations after sequestration was enacted. Segment operating margin increased 70 basis points over the third quarter of last year to 12.8%, continuing the strong performance we\u2019ve achieved thus far this year.","We\u2019ll show the breadth of the margin improvement on Chart 5, which shows our third quarter segment operating margins for each of the 5 business areas compared with last year\u2019s results. Segment margins were higher or comparable in 4 of the 5 business areas. Improvements in Missiles and Fire Control resulted from improved performance across a number of programs, most notably in Air and Missile Defense programs such as PAC-3 and THAAD and Fire Control programs such as the LANTIRN and Sniper programs.","Improvements in Mission Systems and Training were also broad based with the largest improvement coming from our radar programs. Margins in Aeronautics and IS&GS were slightly higher or comparable, while our margin in Space Systems remained strong and was 60 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year. Last year\u2019s results were the highest level ever experienced in Space Systems and included significantly higher earnings from our United Launch Alliance and United Space Alliance joint ventures, the latter due to wind down activities in 2012.","Turning to Chart 6, we\u2019ll discuss our earnings per share. EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was 16% higher than a year ago at $2.57 per share, driven primarily by improved margins and a lower FAS\/CAS adjustment this year. On a pension-adjusted basis, our EPS grew to $2.80 per share in the quarter.","On Chart 7, we\u2019ll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. We continue to have excellent cash generation with $900 million in the quarter, although that is lower than last year\u2019s level, we made a $750 million pension contribution this year, while no contribution was made in the third quarter of last year. We\u2019ve completed our planned funding of our pension plans in 2013 and consistent with our historical practices, we will evaluate making additional contributions to our pension trusts at year-end, but only to the extent that these contributions will not impact our ability to generate $4.3 billion in cash from operations.","Turning to Chart 8, we\u2019ll discuss our cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We\u2019ve returned almost $1billion to shareholders this quarter through share repurchases and dividends. The level of share repurchases was more than double what we did in the third quarter of last year and brings the total cash returned so far this year to more than $2.6 billion.","Moving to Chart 9, we\u2019ll look at our backlog and book-to-bill ratios since last year. Consistent with the quarterly backlog profile, we provided at the beginning of the year, our backlog grew to just under $79 billion this quarter, achieving a strong book-to-bill ratio of $1.3 billion. We continue to expect that backlog will increase further in the fourth quarter and end the year above the $80 billion level.","On Chart 10, we provide our updated guidance. As we said on the last call, the effects of sequestration were not as great this year as we had initially modeled them to be and we now feel comfortable in saying our sales for the year are anticipated to be around the $45 billion level.","Reflecting our strong operational performance throughout this year, we\u2019re increasing our forecasted segment operating profit by $125 million. Partially offsetting improvements in our segment operating performance is an increase in our unallocated expenses for severance charges related to reduction in force announced last week in our MST business area and a net increase in expenses for our deferred compensation plans. The net increase in operating earnings resulted in an increase to our earnings per share guidance of $0.20 to \u2013to $9.40 to $9.70 per share. And finally, we increased our expectations for cash from operations by $100 billion to equal or better than $4.3 billion.","Chart 11 shows our updated outlook for both sales and segment profit by business area and ties the guidance updates from the previous chart. On Chart 12, we provide our initial view of our expectations for 2014. We believe sales next year will be only slightly below the 2013 level with growth in our Aeronautics business area offsetting reduction in our IS&GS and Space Systems business areas, while both Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training are expected to be relatively comparable to their 2013 levels. And we expect our segment operating margins to be lower than this year\u2019s record level, but above the 11.5% its level in total as we experience the dilutive effect of F-35 production growth in Aeronautics, as we described for several quarters along with the absence of several non-recurring benefits in the other business areas this year.","We expect our FAS\/CAS pension adjustment will provide income of $150 million in 2014 after several years of reducing our reported earnings. Our assumptions that led to the favorable adjustment, our 75 basis points increase from the discount rates to 4.75%, a low single-digit return on assets in 2013 and $1 billion in pension funding in 2014.","Finally, we have our summary on Chart 13. We\u2019ve had outstanding performance all during 2013 and we expect that to continue and result in a very solid year, particularly in this dynamic environment. With our current portfolio as well as our enhanced focus on international expansion, we like our strategic positioning heading into the next few years. We\u2019ve provided outstanding value to shareholders this year from both a total shareholder return perspective as well as with cash return to shareholders and while we\u2019re providing high-level trend information today, we\u2019ll provide our usual detailed guidance during the January call.","With that, we\u2019re ready for your questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey, Jason. Good Morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Marillyn and Bruce, so I was wondering if you could just walk us through the assumptions on your \u2013 with your major programs that are embedded in your outlook for 2014, just so some of the building blocks and kind of track progress as we go along?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Jason, I\u2019ll give you a high-level view. Marillyn has something to add, I\u2019ll throw on a couple of other or she could throw on a couple topics as well. So maybe just starting with the biggest business area Aeronautics, probably the topic that you\u2019d be curious about is the aircraft quantity changes say from this year to next year. So think of the F-35 quantities, we\u2019re going to finish the year probably around the 36 aircraft deliveries or so, we expect that to grow somewhat next year to maybe 38, maybe a couple more than that, but somewhere in that range.","Our F-16 deliveries this year are 13 aircrafts. That is expected to grow perhaps about 15 aircraft next year. C-130Js, I think, we\u2019re going to do about 24 to 25. There is one that\u2019s kind of on the bubble of delivering this year and next year, but if it happens this year, it will be 25. Even if that happens this year, we still think we\u2019ll stay steady at about the 24 aircraft level next year. In C-5, this one is ramping up between 2013 and 2014.","We\u2019re going to deliver somewhere between, I\u2019ll say, 5 to as many as 8 this year, but in any event, we think we\u2019ll grow that number to 10 aircraft next year, and the reason we are a little hesitant on giving the numbers for 2013 is because of some of the activities that led to the de-book this quarter relative to some of the over and above works that we\u2019re experiencing in those aircraft that could cause delay in some of those deliveries this year.","If I think around the other business areas, you should think, we are seeing a slight reduction in quantities of some of our Air and Missile products associated with the PAC-3 program, but that\u2019s more than offset at Missiles and Fire Control by increases in the THAAD production quantities, think about both domestically as well as with the recently completed UAE international order.","We have no commercial satellites or commercial launches next year in our Space Systems business. We expect to have obviously no large programs that jump out on our IS&GS business area, but we expect to see a continued downward trend within IS&GS probably somewhere in the -- I think of that as the high single-digit range level between 2013 and 2014, so that probably covers a bunch of program Jason, there may be others you want to hear about, and if so, others can ask on the call when we go down to further questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard T. Safran \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Good morning Rich.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I was interested \u2013 just kind of a two-part question on your comments, Marillyn, at the opening and on the 4Q bookings chart on Chart 9. One, should we kind of infer that there\u2019s very little risk from the Government shutdown on 4Q bookings in terms of what the Government is going to want to contract? and then as a second part, I found it interesting that you had enough confidence in your outlook to talk about 2014 trends. Could you discuss what\u2019s driving your confidence in your outlook, just especially given where the Congress and the Administration are? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey Rich. I\u2019ll give a shot at both of those and we\u2019ll see if Marillyn has some color or commentary to provide beyond that. So fourth quarter orders, we do feel very comfortable in stating what we said relative to expectations that will grow backlog between now and the end of the year. And in particular, the reason we feel that way is that there are really very few competitive awards expected to occur in the fourth quarter and we have really no reliance on sort of new start programs in the quarter either.","And just as importantly, while we\u2019re operating in a continuing resolution environment, we believe all the awards that we\u2019re expecting to receive in the quarter can be awarded under the continuing resolution. So just to maybe name a couple of them that we expect that will lead to the year-end backlog numbers we talked, the most significant awards are occurring in our Space Systems business. So think of that as the SBIRS Spacecraft 5 and 6 contract definitization by the end of the year, the annual -- in this case, the FY14 annual installment of the Fleet Ballistic Missile award.","We expect to receive a pretty significant contract extension on the Orion program within NASA, and then if I go \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 those are probably the most significant, all of which are in Space. If I go to other business areas, we\u2019re expecting things like the normal sort of FY14 award of the C-5 modernization aircraft this year. We should close hopefully on the FY13 contract to finalize or definitize the C-130 deliveries for the U.S. Government, and then we\u2019ve got just a whole slew of sorting what I would call the numerous funding from fiscal year 2014 funds becoming available for things like JASSMs, PAC-3s, sustainment contracts across multiple business areas. So again, we feel pretty good about all those happening. Again, not anything that I would say isn\u2019t a competitive award that could be pushed out or that we could lose in the fourth quarter that would diminish those numbers. So I think it\u2019s a really good visibility as we go into 2014 as well.","I think you asked about the 2014 guidance or maybe you expressed some surprise that we were at the levels we are, so maybe at a high level, I\u2019ll just talk about what we\u2019re seeing in 2014. As Marillyn said, we do expect sales to be slightly lower than 2013 and you should think of that as we are going to see growth in Aeronautics, that\u2019s primarily coming from the F-35 production program as well as the C-5M delivery growth and numbers that I\u2019ve talked about earlier, and that\u2019s offsetting reductions in, as I\u2019ve said, IS&GS and Space and Missiles and Fire Control and MST again are fairly comparable.","Margins, again, we expect to remain above 11.5%. and I\u2019ve talked in quarters past about what I like to refer to as sort of the algebra effect of the F-35, where we get higher volume on the F-35 program at lower margins than the overall margins of Aeronautics and that has the effect of lowering margins in aero overall. Missiles and Fire Control and IS&GS, I would think are going to be relatively comparable to 2013, whereas Space and MST, probably a little lower than where we experienced this year, but still very strong relative to recent history on those \u2013 in both of those business areas and this is due to a number of non-recurring events, positive events that occurred in 2013. Space also has the lower equity earnings expectation in 2014 compared to 2013.","So Rich, maybe just to sum up, 2014, I would say from a margin perspective, looks very similar to 2013 when we began the year just without sort of performance improvements that we have experienced throughout 2013 that we\u2019ve yet to obviously experience in 2014. Maybe one last note on 2014, you should see the tax rate in 2014 increase a little bit over 2013. You\u2019ll recall we actually had two tranches, if you will, of R&D tax credit in the year 2013. So, probably more than you wanted to know there, Rich, but hopefully that covers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Stuart Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Good morning.","Doug Stuart Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I\u2019m interested in understanding the trends in IS&T a little bit better. If you look, and I guess I would put that in conjunction with the comments you made around sequestration, and that sequestration, the impact this year was a little bit less than you had thought. What I\u2019m trying to get at is, is this largely a timing issue or has \u2013 have some other things happened that is kind of strengthened the picture this year. And then how does that link to IS&T which you\u2019ve said will be weaker next year? And does that play into the civil, the defense to the Intel portions of it?","Marillyn A. Hewson","So Doug, I would just say to that point you know when we gave some insight earlier in the year about what we expected on the impact to sequestration, it really was looking across all of businesses, we did recognize that our shorter cycle business like IS&GS would have a more significant near-term impact. But that was juts modeling that Bruce and his team did just to kind of take a look at what was the outlook for the year of things that could be impacted, we have not seen the impact and so it wasn\u2019t really just because of IS&GS.","IS&GS is \u2013 because it has a large IT infrastructure work and support and the information technology area, has been impacted because that\u2019s an area that the Government can cut back on pretty readily. We do \u2013 it is \u2013 as I said, it is a short shorter cycle business, where we see growth there, potential growth where as in the cyber security arena, but it\u2019s fairly a new area for us or we continue to see some offset of growth there. Bruce, I don\u2019t if you want to maybe add some other\u2026","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes maybe just, I think you asked a question about where we\u2019re seeing that maybe by the LOVs, the civil, defense and intelligence. And so we\u2019re actually seeing little bit of growth in our defense business and a lot of that\u2019s because we\u2019ve won \u2013 going back to Marillyn\u2019s, kind of we\u2019ve won several sort of cyber activities from competitors sort of \u2013 no we refer to as playing offense if you will in that arena, so we\u2019ve been successful on it. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why the defense business is growing this year over last year.","As we looked next year, there\u2019s not as many of those sorts of competitions coming up, I believe all three lines of the business civil, defense and intelligence in next year\u2019s numbers as we said here today though, we\u2019re expecting to reduce compared to 2013. And I think that\u2019s just sort of the \u2013 a combination of two things, one that is what I\u2019ve always said when you\u2019re the largest provider of IT Services to the Federal Government for 18 straight years now, I believe. That when the federal government\u2019s budget goes down, you are likely to go down as well; we expect that to happen again in 2014.","And the other side of that is, I\u2019ll say we have within the numbers that I talked, within the ranges that I\u2019ve talked in the trend information so that considered the growth [ph] and ongoing sequestration level impact this year as well. So the combination of those two events is what we see happening within IS&GS. I always like to close that by saying, at some point, IT spending has to increase. You cannot continually reduce IT spending for the Federal Government and expect to provide the services the population expects. In some point, it will turn the other way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is actually Elizabeth in for Ron today.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Elizabeth.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. We see \u2013 it\u2019s actually seeing Boeing really emphasize recently their Partnering for Success program, where they are trying to get 15% of their suppliers. And we were just wondering, with all the cash that you\u2019re returning to shareholders and the DoD under so much pressure, at what point do you think the DoD sort of tries to implement its own Partnering for Success and take 15% from the defense contractors?","Bruce L. Tanner","Well, I\u2019ll let Marillyn state from her perspective, Elizabeth, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever stopped Charles to do what we think makes sense economically and from an affordability perspective with our supply chain. And we maybe have a little different views, there has been some \u2013 and we think the real ability to have supply chain starts actually with the designs that we come up with and how we can make those more affordable to build and sustain going forward.","So it\u2019s not something that we woke up overnight and realize that we had the correct elements for our supply chain to become affordable. We are probably two-thirds of our costs to sales today are in the supply chain. If we are going to be affordable, it\u2019s going to have to include our supply chain and always has and that\u2019s the focus that we do today. We have, I would argue, very good relationships with our supply chain. We have annual sessions, where we meet with them.","Actually Marillyn has spoken to that group in mass to show the emphasis that we place on our supply chain and expectations not just of affordability, but of quality as schedule timeliness and alike. So this is something that we put in place for quite sometime that is not a new item of course.","Marillyn A. Hewson","I would add to that, Elizabeth, I think if you are asking is our customer treating us as their supplier in a fashion that they were going to put some push on us to be more affordable, they have been. I mean, that is a \u2013 they have been very clear that is a top priority for them. They are dealing with very significant budget constraints and increasing global security demand. So they are challenged and, across our industry, they have a press for us to all to be more affordable in solutions that we provide them and how we manage our business.","It\u2019s not something that is new to us. We\u2019ve been very proactive as leaders in the industry to drive down our cost and we have taken actions to reduce our footprint. We have had to take some painful actions in reducing our workforce at times to adjust to the business base. We are investing in technologies to provide them with a more affordable product. So we take the weight out or we make it \u2013 overall total cost lower. A lot of things that we are doing to support our customers drive for affordability, and at the same time, they offer incentive provisions to get in cost savings because it is so critically important to them. So in some of our contracts, we have those types of incentives to encourage us to continue to drive costs down.","So as Bruce said, we manage our supply chain. It\u2019s an ongoing effort on our part to make sure that we get the best value from them in terms of costs, schedule, quality and at the same time, we want to provide our customer with the most affordable solutions and the most technically capable solutions for what their needs are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks so much, and great performance again.","Bruce L. Tanner","Thank you, Cai.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thank you.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","So I have a two-part question. First, you talked about sales being down modestly next year. Could you talk about international, if that\u2019s growing, what sort of growth do you see in international and what are the key drivers? And secondly, DoD as it looks at the fiscal 2015 budget, had some priority programs and some bill payer programs, potential bill payer programs, included in those are C-130, C-5 and LCS. Maybe you could comment on your thoughts as to whether those programs you think are at risk in the FY15 budget? Thanks.","Marillyn A. Hewson","So on the international growth side, we certainly continue to see growth in F-35. In fact, over the next five years, close to half of the orders will be international deliveries for the F-35 as we move forward. On C-130J, there continues to be a demand for the C-130J and we continue to sell F-16s around the world. So we see growth in those areas. Missile defense is another very important element for us in our international growth, Bruce talked about that and PAC-3 and of course, we have our operations for Aegis Ashore, and then, we do see other opportunities for us as we look forward into the \u2013 in the satellite, commercial satellite arena, and cyber security and our IT arena for growth in the sale and international growth.","On the F-15 priorities, you mentioned C-130, LCS and C-5, all of those are part of our \u2013 of the strategic management review that was done by the U.S. Government. They are high priority programs and, in addition to those, I think Missile Defense continues to be a high-priority program.","Bruce L. Tanner","And the another thing I would add Cai is, I was a little surprised to hear C-130 mentioned in that comment, where one of the few problems in the DoD that\u2019s actually is being considered for a multi-year program to buy an additional 79 aircraft for a couple of the services right now. I think that\u2019s got strong support, it obviously has reduced \u2013 affordability aspect to it versus buying them on individual fiscal years that has I think been well received by our customers and we expect that to happen. So that\u2019s one that caught my ear a little bit, somewhat of a surprise when you had that to discussion there.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi David are you on mute?","David E. Strauss \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hey good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey there.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","David E. Strauss \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning Marillyn. I wanted to ask you about back on sequestration. So when you saying in the release that you assumed all impact known associated with sequestration, just so I\u2019m clear that that you\u2019re assuming inherently in that that sequestration relates to fiscal 2014 comes through as we know announced another $15 billion to $20 billion cut off of to the total DoD budgets. And then the last part of my question, maybe if you could walk us through Bruce, I think back in January, maybe within the airport [ph] you put together that side that showed that in terms of the total revenues that would be impacted by sequestration in 2013 were in like 20%. Where does that number move to in 2014, or in other words how much of your \u2013 what proportion you think of your revenues will actually be impacted by sequestration in 2014? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes. Okay thank you David. It\u2019s a good question. So let me give you maybe a long windy answer on the sequestration impacts for next year. I think I\u2019ll cover hopefully both of your questions in this answers. If not again maybe you can come back on and ask the question again, but. So we still think sequestration how that impacts 2014, is broken up from our business area perspective than the sort of the long cycle businesses and short cycle. We always refer to aeronautics and space for instance as long cycle businesses. But there are also large parts of Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training that are also really considered to be long cycle businesses, as well.","So you should think of those as, in my words being relatively insulated part of the effects to sequestration in FY 2014, because most of their calendar year 2014 sales are from prior fiscal year funded activities or prior fiscal year funded backlog. That also says there\u2019s not probably as much upside as sequestration improves over what our expectations are either in those long cycle businesses. Our short cycle businesses and primary one being the IS&GS, but also has smaller parts Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training as well. We faced some pretty good reduction into the numbers that we\u2019re expecting relative to the guidance, assuming the trend information we provided to the slightly less than 2013 sales those reductions are planned in that outlook already.","And we think that pretty much captures what we think will happen under a sequestration environment, under a lot of different scenarios that we can think of. And the reason for that is while we say they are short cycle businesses, each one of those businesses IS&GS, the service is part of MFC, the service is part of MST and backlog from prior year funding is actually greater than one time sales in each case.","So, there was not as long or as not as significant in terms of the backlog as the long cycle business and there is definitely more current year award to current year sales going on in those business areas. It is more insulated than perhaps you might think, and I think we experienced that ourselves and we try to do the modeling at the start of this year that we actually have more insulation in my words that maybe we \u2013 maybe we would otherwise thought we had at the start of the year.","There is also the aspect next year that we don\u2019t want to lose track and back to I guess Cai\u2019s question. We do expect international growth for the next year both in terms of absolute dollar as well as on a percent of sales base. So that helps to mitigate any down side we\u2019re seeing from the sequestration impact as well, and finally at least as we\u2019ve looked at it, we think there is minimal \u2013 if there is really any reliance on 2013 unobligated funds, balance that\u2019s left, the outstanding at the end of the fiscal year to become 2014 sales for Lockheed Martin.","So if, if those funds were to evaporate, if those funds were to be used to offset FY 2014 sequestration reductions, we think again, we\u2019re again insulated from that aspect as well. So hopefully that covers the two questions you had there David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is opened.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning everybody.","Bruce L. Tanner","Morning Noah.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out how the parse \u2013 to me revenue being down slightly is a positive surprise given what the budget is doing, and that you are the Bellwether in sense. And I hear you saying and I know that you have well positioned the favorite programs and I obviously hear you saying no that it\u2019s a long cycle business. I guess, I\u2019m trying to sort of quantify or parse out, how much of each of those two items it really is in 2014, because if it\u2019s almost entirely just favored programs, that would suggest you could move back to actually growing sooner than later if sequestration is the last cut. Whereas if it\u2019s long, if it\u2019s more being long cycle than it is favored programs, that would suggest you actually have several more years of not really being able to grow the top line even if sequestration is the last cut?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, so interesting question, Noah, and I\u2019ll see if I can parse my answers to the question the way you parsed your questions. as we look into 2014, I think one of the things that may surprise some folks as going forward is that we\u2019re actually probably seeing more growth in the F-35 program in next year the number that we are trending towards, the slightly less than $45 billion next year, that maybe a lot of people would have expected. So just in big numbers, the F-35 is going to be 15% or 16% of the sales of the Corporation in 2013 and F-35 jointly between the development program and the production program, but all of the growth coming from the production program is probably going to grow some 15% year-over-year from 2013 to 2014.","So that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s one of those programs, Noah that I would characterize as both long cycle and the right priority. I think the prioritization has been demonstrated continually throughout the past year, both domestically and internationally, with the support that we\u2019re getting on the program and obviously by definition, I guess, it\u2019s a long cycle program. I think we\u2019ve got other programs that has same deal, the C-130, I mentioned with the multi-year, the Air and Missile Defense programs, where they\u2019re both long cycle and high priority; LCS is another one that would fall in that category.","So I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Marillyn opine here also on it, because I know she feels strongly about this, but we\u2019ve said all along we think that we have the best portfolio in the business. We think we have the opportunity to sell that portfolio internationally, which helps to mitigate or mute the impacts of the domestic reductions. And so I don\u2019t think that the scenario you described where we would expect to see growth depending on how sequestration plays out in 2014 is unrealistic at all.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Yes, I\u2019d just agree with what Bruce has outlined for you. And we\u2019ve talked, as you said yourself, we have a well positioned portfolio of programs and as Bruce outlined where we see the growth opportunities in 2014. If there is an impact with sequestration as we \u2013 there is a full impact with sequestration. We walked through where the impact will be on the shorter cycle businesses. If we don\u2019t see that same significant level, we should expect to have some offset there and then the longer cycle business as we move on, we do see growth, continued growth in Air and Missile Defense and the F-35 and even F-16 upgrades and the number of other opportunities on C-130Js internationally as well as the multi-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Good Morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Joseph B. Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Couple of Green IT Tech questions for you, Bruce, just on the margins, maybe it would help us if you quantified a little bit the two items that you say might pressure segment margins next year. How much pressure do you see on the F-35 becoming a bigger part of the mix, because you\u2019re 12.8% year-to-date on segment margins just seems like a 11.5%. There is a lot of room to come in ahead of 11.5% even given some of the pressures? And the second part of that is just on MST, in particular, you highlighted radar programs as being a big driver of the upside, we can see adjustments in the quarter, are you getting into a situation there, where there is \u2013 you could for a few quarters, get some upside just given that the opportunities on those contracts or is just truly do you think not sustainable? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, thanks, Joe. So let\u2019s see the F-35, is in the reference to what\u2019s happening with the F-35 growth and its impact on Aeronautics margin, and first off, I know you are looking at the 12.8%, but I think if you \u2013 that\u2019s where we ended the quarter. I think that\u2019s the highest quarter we\u2019ve ever had in the history of the Corporation. If you go to the full year, I think, we\u2019re looking \u2013 if you go to mid point of guidance, probably in the 12.3% to 12.4% range. So I\u2019m not going to debate whether that\u2019s going down or up relative to 11.5% and it obviously is, but it may not be from the 12.8% picture starting from.","The only thing I tried to emphasize was on the \u2013 on a previous question was that 11.5% that we are talking about, actually looks a lot like where we started the year 2013. I forgot what we \u2013 what our guidance was in the start of the year, but it was somewhere in the 11.6% or 11.7% as I recall, it kind of feels like a similar level to me is where we started in 2013. Most years we have had positive performance improvements throughout the year that have enabled us to have benefits. We don\u2019t count on those happening every year when we provide the initial guidance, but I think our track record for most years would say that\u2019s been where we\u2019ve been successful. So as I look at Aeronautics, I would expect that reduction to occur I mean from a margin perspective 2013 versus 2014, they are going to \u2013 I think if we go to the midpoint they are probably in the 11.4-ish range. And I would think that we\u2019ll still see it somewhere in the 11% margins even with the dilutive effective of the F-35 and C-5 increases in Aeronautics.","The point I\u2019m trying to make on the \u2013 in my prepared remarks was that in particular with an MST we had I believe in the second quarter that was the highest margin in the history of MST, and we had a few contractual resolutions there that we did described in both the press release and Q which you should think of being $75-ish million or so. On top of that, we have had very good performance, you mentioned the Radar programs, those are very good. I think that\u2019s a business that kind of stays in 11-ish range on a kind of a go-forward basis.","And then you didn\u2019t ask about it, but the one I mentioned previously, was the Space Systems Company with the joint venture in equity earnings. We had some high equity earnings this year, really associated with launch related activities. Those are expected to come down a little bit next year. Could we see the same experience with some performance out of ULA, next year as we saw this year? Yes. But are we planning on that with our guidance? Not at this point in time. So Space Systems, I\u2019m very pleased with margins there, again this is probably the highest share in the history of space. I think that\u2019s a business that probably stays in 12% range going into next year.","So what we say here today, we are not at all just pleased with where we expect the margins to go next year and I\u2019d say we have the same sorts of opportunities to increase those margins next year as we did this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Rob Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner","Good morning.","Rob Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","On the F-35, on the most recent contract you signed; I was wondering if you can give us some color on how the contractual terms might have changed, and how your discussions with the customer have progressed, you could have a separate customer?","Bruce L. Tanner","Firstly. Rob, I guess, the first thing as we negotiated Lot 6 and 7 combined if you will, they are separate contracts, but we did do a \u2013 essentially, concurrently. And we did so in about six months time versus Lot 5 where we probably took about 18 months. So I think we are on a good path there. As for as contractually speaking, we do have essentially a fixed price contract and I\u2019d say essentially, because there is a little bit of essential share on underrun there between the Government and ourselves, there is no share on the overrun.","So think about fixed price in that regard and I\u2019m trying to think Rob, I think off the top of my head, I think most other terms and conditions that we negotiated with Lot 5 carried over and so I\u2019m looking at Marillyn here, she was very engaged in Lot 5, carried over into Lot 6 and 7. I don\u2019t think we had much to speak of the change of anything there. So I\u2019ll probably leave it at that.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Yes. I agree, Bruce.","Bruce L. Tanner","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ross D. Cowley \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, everybody. This is actually Ross Cowley in for Rob. I just wanted to touch base on the AMDR contract, specifically find out how surprised you were when the award went to Raytheon and whether how the debriefing is going, whether this is something that you could protest?","Marillyn A. Hewson","Well, I\u2019ll answer that. From an AMDR standpoint, we were disappointed on the decision by the Government. we did see a decrease last week and so we\u2019re in the midst of evaluating the information. But we\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve been engaged on the Aegis System for the past 42 years. So we have deep understanding of that program and of the mission. So we were certainly disappointed, but we\u2019re still on the midst of evaluation \u2013 evaluating information that came out of the debriefing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles A. Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, hi good morning. Bruce, the cash into 2014, outside of the pension tailwind and net income, how should we think about the advances, cash taxes, any of that working capital sensitivities.","Bruce L. Tanner","And so trying to look at some paper I got in front of me, Myles, in terms of the advances. typically, what we project going forward is that our advances will come down. We don\u2019t have a huge number of direct commercial contract plans in the 2014 timeframe that would sort of bring typical advance payments with them, most of our international growth next year comes in the form of foreign military sales contracts. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see the starting sorts of advances that we\u2019ve had in the past that result in our advanced balance going on the balance sheet there.","Working capital wise, I think we\u2019re going to see some improvements there, as we kind of go through the production and we obviously have some withholds associated with the business system rule for things like Earned Value Management System that have been made pretty public that we expect to finalize and that will improve the working capital position associated with those. I think from a thinking or planning perspective, you should think of next year\u2019s number, I think being higher than the level of cash that it\u2019s going to generate in 2013. I know it\u2019s been in the either in a response to question or in my prepared remarks we talked about the potential for looking in the fourth quarter additional pension contributions. Even with that, I\u2019d say we would stay above the $4.3 billion level in 2013 and I think we\u2019ll be north of that in 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, good morning Bruce.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey George.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Good morning.","George D. Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research LLC","The question I have got is two parts. Last years ending funded backlog with $55 billion versus the $82 billion that you quote. Given that the funding is less assured these days, what do you figure that funded backlog will end this year? And then my second one is, I know you\u2019ve given some color to try and mitigate why sales are only down a few percent next year. But just conceptually, I mean, you\u2019ll be down 4% to 5% this year and next year, the budget is worse, the sequestration impact is worse. So maybe a little more clarity on why you think you\u2019ll actually decline less next year than this year? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","So George good questions as usual. So I\u2019m doing this a little of the top of my head. You asked funded backlog at the end of last year, funded at the end of this year and maybe embedded in your question was, don\u2019t you have more risk, the difference between funded and unfunded. I think the key distinct and there\u2019s what\u2019s obligated, versus necessarily what\u2019s funded. The real issue from a sequestration perspective is, taking those unobligated funds and those are the ones that are really at risk S-3 as I made to comments before about, again why we think we have in 2014 a pretty good handle along what our revenue is going to be. So we don\u2019t have a reliance on the unobligated funds turning into sales in 2014.","I don\u2019t particularly see an issue was funded backlog balance in the end of this year. I think it will be comparable, either percentage basis or an absolute basis to where we ended last year on a percentage basis relative to the ending backlog amount. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue that I am particularly concerned about as we sit here today. Going forward, you asked about my paraphrase, why we feel comfortable with saying we\u2019re going to be relatively comparable to the 2013 sales, even though it appears the budget is going down more. You\u2019re actually right with that.","Going back to the question, I think, Noah asked, it is a function of our portfolio as to things that I talked about when I described the sequestration impacts. We do expect international sales to grow both on a percentage basis and on absolute dollar basis. Our single largest program, the F-35, as I said, is expected to grow 15%. We have other growth, in particular, Air and Missile Defense products have \u2013 and Missiles and Fire Control. And so for all the reasons that I went around the hone earlier by each business area, we feel pretty good about that. I mean, the things that I would think could change that dramatically, George, from what we are expecting to see now as if sort of obligated, under contract programs were terminated or partially terminated. And if that were to happen, sort of all bets are off, but that\u2019s not a scenario that we\u2019re counting on or guiding towards at all when we give our trend information for 2014.","Jerry F. Kircher, III","Stephanie, I think we\u2019re maybe a minute past to the hour here. So I\u2019m going to maybe turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks, Jerry.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2019 earnings call as we review our quarterly results, our key accomplishments and discuss our preliminary outlook for 2020. ","As today's release illustrates, we had another quarter of strong results; financially, strategically and operationally. These results reflect the continued strength of our core legacy programs with recent strategic wins contributing additional growth. ","Our focus on program execution and investments in long term growth capabilities have our team well positioned for the future. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide preliminary trending data for 2020. ","First, I'd like to begin by highlighting a few of the elements that drove our strong third quarter performance. Sales this quarter exceeded last year's third quarter by 6%. Year-to-date we are nearly 12% over our 2018 results. ","Missiles and Fire Control have the highest overall growth this quarter as deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, development work on new hypersonic programs, and PAC-3 missile production grew from last year. ","Our Aeronautics business area also saw strong sales growth in the F-35 development, sustainment and production and we increased our joint strike fighter deliveries to 28 aircrafts this quarter compared to 20 in last year's third quarter. ","Our space team saw a continued growth from recent strategic wins in their Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR contract, the GPS III satellite production program and new hypersonic wins in their portfolio. ","This quarter we added over $600 million to our backlog, which now exceeds $137 billion and has reached a record level for the 5th consecutive quarter. Our segment profit grew by comparable amounts with the third quarter results improving 5% over the 2018 third quarter, and we had a strong quarter of cash generation achieving $2.5 billion of cash from operations. We now have brought in over $5.8 billion of operating cash year-to-date, keeping us on pace to deliver at least $7.6 billion in cash from operations for the year. ","Our team continues to drive growth and performance in all financial metrics with a portfolio of products, technologies and services that are in great demand by our customers and which continue to provide long term value to stockholders. ","Turning to cash deployment during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved two key actions demonstrating our commitment to returning cash to stockholders. First, the dividend was increased by 9% to $2.40 per share quarterly and $9.60 annually, continuing our commitment to providing shareholders a strong dividend. ","Second, our share repurchase authority was increased by $1 billion, bringing our total repurchase authority to $3.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. The recent actions taken by our Board will position us to continue our shareholder friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. ","Turning back to our business areas, I will touch on some significant operational and strategic accomplishment in just a moment, but I want to first highlight a few of the notable new business wins and follow-on awards that have helped position us for long term growth. ","I\u2019ll start this quarter with our Rotary and Mission Systems Organization. This integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business was selected by the U.S. Army to develop a Sentinel A4 radar system. The Sentinel A4 radar replaces the current A3 variant and will provide improved air and missile defense against low flying, unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other threats. ","The initial $280 million award is to develop and deliver 18 new A4 System. The army\u2019s plan of record is to upgrade 199 A3 Radars, but use Sentinel A4s, with a total potential value of approximately $3 billion over the life of the contract, from sales to domestic and international customers. ","This strategic win provides the corporation with a new growth opportunity, building upon our successes in the Space Fence Long Range Discrimination Radar and Homeland Defense Radar programs, and I\u2019m very pleased to add this program to our portfolio. ","RMS also announced the award of two contracts totaling over $500 million to evolve and improve the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System for the Missile Defense Agency. Our command, control, battle management and communications contract or C2BMC a legacy program dating back over 15 years, received a $320 million award to enhance the MDA\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defense System, integrating our long range discrimination radar and other new sensors into the solution, providing advanced tracking capabilities for emerging threats and further hardening the cyber security posture of the system. C2BMC is a cornerstone of the nation's layered air and missile defense network and we are excited to evolve this critical capability. ","Separately the Missile Defense Agency awarded RMS a $240 million contract to support the modeling and simulation framework for the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This new contract will test the operational effectiveness and performance of fielded ballistic missile defense equipment and evaluate new conceptual architectures to help ensure the war fighter receives the most effective solution possible. ","In Aeronautics, our F-35 teams received notification from the state department of the approval for the proposed foreign military sales to Poland. The notification includes the procurement of 32 conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL variant, with a total potential value of approximately $6 billion."," The F-35 CTOL once deployed will integrate seamlessly with the Polish Air Forces existing 48 aircraft F-16 fleet and would replace aging fourth generation legacy aircrafts. We're proud of our long standing partnership with the Polish government and industry and look forward to continuing that relationship as we deliver this unrivaled fighter jet to this important NATO allay. ","Our F-35 team was also awarded a $2.4 billion IDIQ contract for continued sustainment support to provide initial spare parts for our U.S. Marine Corp, Navy and Air Force Aircraft, as well as for partner countries and other international customers over a two year period. ","Keeping with Aero, our F-16 program received a formal $800 million award for the production and delivery of 14 state of the art, Block 70 Fighter Jet to the Slovak Republic following the notification we discussed last year. The award brings our F-16 backlog to 30 aircraft with Bahrain and the Slovak Republic as our latest customer nation, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to help provide security products to these important allies. We are excited with the opportunities we see ahead of us in the F-16 pipeline and we look forward to building this remarkable aircraft for years to come.","In Missiles and Fire Control, we received a $1.4 billion order to provide Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD interceptor support to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and this announcement brings the total awarded value of the KSA THAAD program to over $3.5 billion. ","Moving forward to our Space business area, we received a $2.7 billion award to deliver the first three Orion spacecraft to support NASA\u2019s Deep Space Exploration objectives for the second order of 3 Orion vehicles planned in fiscal year 2022. Orion is the NASA\u2019s spacecraft that will carry astronauts from earth to the moon and bring them safely home as part of the Artemis Lunar Exploration Program. ","NASA has expressed a commitment to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024 and Orion is the planned delivery vehicle. The goals of the Artemis program are to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities with the ultimate objective to provide the technologies and experiences to launch a mission to explore Mars in the 2030s. ","We're excited that the Orion has been identified as the space craft to deliver these brave astronauts to lunar and one day Martian orbits and bring them safely home to earth. And just after the close of the third quarter, our space business area received a $495 million award with a potential for over $1.2 billion of value on the Trident II program. The award is for the production and deployed system support for the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile system, a program we've been leading for over 60 years. ","These announcements reflect the long-term investments we have made to develop new technologies, leading to new franchise programs and innovations to enhance legacy products providing us with the continued growth opportunity for the future.","Turning briefly to budget, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was an entered law during the third quarter and established increased spending levels for discretionary defense budgets and total national security spending for FY 20 and FY 21 efficiently eliminating the constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. ","Both chambers of Congress had advanced appropriations bills in support of this budget increases, and in both versions our programs are well supported. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed and the federal government is currently operating under a short term continuing resolution for fiscal year 2020 that is set to expire on November 21. ","The CR limits the Department of Defense Authorization to previous fiscal year levels until an appropriations bill can be signed into law, but the large portion of our backlog were already funded from prior fiscal years. We do not expect any impact to our 2019 financial outlook from this current short term CR. ","Should the continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints be extended beyond November 21, we could experience some level of impact to our 2020 trending data depending on the duration of the CR. ","Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant events form across the corporation that occurred during the past quarter, which demonstrate our strong operational performance. In missiles and Fire Control, we are excited by two expansions we are undertaking to accommodate planned growth in our tactical missile and air missile defense lines of business. ","In August we opened a new 30,000 square foot facility in Texas to support production of PAC-3 missiles, THAAD interceptors and guided multiple launch rocket systems. ","In September we broke ground on a new Long Range Fires Production facility in Arkansas which will add 70,000 square feet to the current property and allows us to accommodate increased production demand in our army tactical missile system and other Precision Fires Program. ","And in our Space business area this quarter, I was extremely proud to attend the official groundbreaking ceremony announcing Northern Alabama as our flagship location for the corporations hypersonic strike work, establishing a new facility for the engineering and manufacturing of hypersonic weapons. These three actions reflect our commitment to investing in legacy program, as well as emerging technology to support the current and future needs of our customers. ","In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team completed an extensive set of testing for our combat rescue helicopter to successfully achieve the milestone C decision moving the program into the low rate initial production phase of the contract. The joint Sikorsky and U.S. Air Force test team executed over 70 hours of envelope expansion flight, validating the modifications to the venerable Black Hawk platform that will allow it to perform its importance search and rescue mission. ","The U.S. Air force plan of record is to revive 113 helicopters with five aircrafts currently in various stages of production. With enhanced avionics, improved offensive and defensive capabilities, and a new fuel system that nearly doubled capacity, the combat rescue helicopter has now been deemed capable of fulfilling its crucial mission to save down war fighters anytime, anywhere around the world. ","With that, I'll turn the call over Ken. ","Ken Possenriede","Thanks Marillyn and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today.","Let\u2019s begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. ","Sales segment operating profit, cash from operations and earning per share continued to be strong. We generated $2.5 billion of cash from operations and we continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning nearly $830 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, and we grew our backlog to $137.4 billion representing the 5th consecutive quarter in a row of record backlog. ","Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, we've updated our financial metrics for 2019. In addition, we\u2019ll be discussing how our performance this year is carrying over into 2020 with our preliminary financial trends. ","Turning to chart four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. As I mentioned earlier this year, for comparison purposes the third quarter of this year had 13 weeks in the accounting period, while last year\u2019s third quarter had 14 weeks in the accounting period. Even without the extra week in the quarter, our results exceeded last year. ","Sale grew 6% compared with the same quarter last year to $15.2 billion continuing the strength we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 5% over last year's levels to nearly $1.7 billion. Year-to-date all four business areas contributed to the significant increases in both sales and operating profits. ","On chart five we\u2019ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.66 was $0.52 or 10% higher than our results last year driven by operational performance. ","Moving on to chart six, we provide our revised outlook for 2019. With just one quarter left in the year, we are providing a point estimate of results for the entire year versus the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. ","We expect sales to be approximately $59.1 billion for the year, above the mid-point of guidance range we provided last quarter. At $6.4 billion our forecasted segment operating profit is above the mid-point of the guidance range last quarter, resulting in a 10.9% margin. This puts our sales approximately 10% above 2018 results and segment operating profit approximately 9% above last year. ","Moving on our FAS\/CAS pension adjustment, it remains unchanged at a little less than $1.5 billion. Our earnings per share is expected to be around $21.55, above the high end of our pervious guidance range driven by a lower tax rate than earlier estimate and the continued performance across our businesses. Cash from operations remains at equal to or greater than $7.6 billion, which has increased in the first two quarters of 2019 from the $7.4 billion outlook in January. ","Chart seven provides a reconciliation of our earnings per share outlook this quarter compared to last quarter. Operational performance is expected to drive approximately $0.07 increase in the EPS from an advised outlook for segment operating profit as a result of higher sales volumes in our business area. ","Tax predominately makes up the remaining $0.48 in EPS with most of that increase coming from a lower tax rate as we continue to reflect the latest benefits from the city with the foreign derived intangible income deduction that we discussed earlier this year. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 13%. Together these changes represent an expected 55% improvement from the mid-point of the EPS range we provided last quarter to a new outlook of $21.55 per share. ","Chart eight shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year. Our point estimate for sales outlook is above the midpoint point of our last guidance increase to $59.1 billion. On chart nine, we\u2019ve provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. ","Like our sales, segment operating profit is above the mid-point of the guidance range from last quarter. RMS is slightly above their mid-point and space\u2019s latest outlook shows them exceeding the high end of their prior range. ","On chart 10 we provide a preliminary look at our 2020 trends. We expect our 2020 sales to be approximately $62 billion, 5% growth over our current outlook for 2019 sales. We expect our segment operating margin will be between 10.5% and 10.8%. This marginal level assumes similar performance in our legacy programs in all business areas, with some dilution from the continued growth in new start programs we have recently won. ","We estimate that our cash from operations will be equal to or greater than $7.2 billion, inclusive of our of our required $500 million pension contribution for next year. We also plan to have at least $1 billion in share repurchases, the same level as we expect to have in 2019, more than offsetting any planned share issuances in the year. ","And similar to 2019, we have a debt maturity coming the next year; its approximately $1.3 billion. Just to note, our 2020 trending data does not include any impact regarding the recent potential sanctions or other actions the government may take with respect to Turkey. We will continue to evaluate any potential impacts to our program. ","Moving to our FAS\/CAS outlook, we expect our net 2020 FAS\/CAS adjustment will be approximately $2.1 billion or about $600 million higher than the adjustments for 2019. This adjustment reflects the final phase of the planned freeze of our salary pension plans that we previously disclosed. ","This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 3.25% or 100 basis points below the 2018 rates. Based on our performance to-date we are assuming a 15% return on our assets for the full year. And going forward we are maintaining our long term asset return assumption of 7% per year. ","And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We've seen strong performance from all of our business areas this year and I'm especially pleased with our record backlog throughout the year. Our updated financial metrics anticipates strong full year results and we expect to see continued growth into 2020 based on our portfolio of legacy program, new wins and strategic investments that have continued to grow our backlog through the year and across our portfolio. ","And with that, we're ready for your questions. John. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And first from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Rich Safran","Marillyn, Ken, Greg, good morning! How are you? ","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning. ","Ken Possenriede","Good morning. ","Rich Safran","So either Marillyn or Ken, a question on your 2020 guide with a few parts to it. You know you are guiding to 5% growth. You just covered that next year. Now, always to the best you can, could you discuss the segments you expect to see the most growth from next year? What the primary drivers are, the 5% growth and where you see some possible upside? And on margins, I just wanted to ask. Your guide for next year just seems a little bit light relative to where expectations were and I thought maybe you could discuss what's driving that? Thanks. ","Ken Possenriede","You bet, thanks Rich. It\u2019s probably best I take that question and if you don\u2019t mind Rich, I\u2019ll give you some color and you can go across all business areas. ","So I'll start with Aero. You know next year we see mid-single digit growth across the business areas for Aeronautics. F-35 \u2013 we see growth on F-35 similar to the Aero growth, that mid-single digits. ","Development and sustainment, we see that growing faster than production. We see strong growth at IFG and that\u2019s specifically F-16. You heard Marillyn mention we\u2019ve got the Slovak Republic order behind us, we are now starting to build [indiscernible] Jets that we\u2019ll start delivering out in late 2021 and we\u2019ve got strong [mod] [ph] work there. ","And we also see strong growth at Skunk Works. If you recall, we talked about the classified program we won. The Skunk should grow double digit sales next year. ","And finally for Aeronautics, at AMMM, no surprise. We see sales decline in 2020 compared to 2019. If you recall we are going to deliver 28 C-130s this year, forecasting around 25 next year and a reduction in 2021 to about 23. So you\u2019ll see mid-single digits decline in sales there, so just to summarize again for Aeronautics, mid-single digit growth. ","At Missiles and Fire Control, it will be our fastest growing business area again. We see low mid-digit growth. We see strong growth at strike weapons specifically in precision fires and JASSM we also see strong growth in integrated Air and Missile Defense and that would THAAD and PAC-3.","At RMS we see low single digit growth. We're finally starting to see some strong growth at Sikorsky. Think of that as MH-60 combat search and rescue and the presidential helicopters VH-92 programs. That will more than offset. We see declines in our IWSS business. Think of that as Littoral Combat Ship and the domestic piece of Aegis. ","And in space we see growth, which last year at the time we would not have seen [indiscernible] we were going to see growth at space. And if you recall we talked about our strong order book this year and the lion share of that up-side was at space and we are continuing to see that in the future. ","The upsides are in hypersonics programs and think of the space transportation segment of that business, so Orion and [OPIR] [ph]. OPIR is growing and that is slightly offsetting declines and think of some of our historical programs that are starting to wind down like [indiscernible] and Advanced [DHS] [ph]. So net, we see roughly 5% growth for the corporation. ","Going to profit margins, we see Aeronautics having similar margins as they did in 2019. F-35 profits will grow at the same rate as sales, so think of that as mid-single digit. As I mentioned with sales, development sustainment is growing faster than production and therefore dilutive in nature. ","I mentioned the Skunk\u2019s. So the Skunk\u2019s is growing. Their profit, their absolute profit dollars will be growing, but that is also dilutive in nature, so you'll see basically mid-single digits at Aeronautics. ","Missiles and Fire Control, we see right now less risk retirement in 2020 than we saw in 2019, and as we've talked about the classified program that we won and that will continue to grow as will other development programs ramping-up so that they have dilutive margin. Missiles and Fire Control we see overall we\u2019ll have lower margins in 2020 than in 2019. ","RMS \u2013 we are seeing similar to or slightly higher margins in 2020 compared to 2019. That\u2019s driven by our training business and our Sikorsky piece of the business. ","And finally at Space, we also see like Missiles and Fire Control less risk retirements are forecasted in 2020 and also the new program starts. And on ULA, we see similar earnings in 2020 as we did in 2019. ","So overall also we see space like Missiles and Fire Control will have lower margins in 2020 than we had in 2019. Hopefully, that gave you enough color Rich. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Myles Walton","Great, thanks. Good morning! Marillyn I was hoping you could talk about the F-35 and in the context of any risk you are managing around Turkey. Obviously, you've excluded it from the guidance, but Ellen Lord I think this week mentioned that Lockheed is actually the agent for reassigning the work that might be or is being sourced outside of what's being done instead of Turkey to other players. Can you clarify for us if that means that Lockheed is just the agent for resourcing network or if there's any risk that you are carrying in that transition as well? ","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question Myles and I think probably the broader answer beyond just F-35, I\u2019ll ask you Ken maybe to weigh in on the balance of the portfolio, because we\u2019ve had some questions from others about it. This might be a good time to cover Turkey all up. ","But as you know, back in July the Department of Defense announced the exclusion of Turkey from the F-35 program and that included the in-country suppliers, with the target date of March of 2020. So we\u2019ve been working closely with the U.S. government for several months for quite some time on establishing alternate sources of supply in the United States to be able to quickly take the place of the current contributions that Turkey is providing to the program in terms of components and parts, etcetera, and all throughout that we continue to evaluate our supply chain. ","We are you know or as the prime contractor for those sources of supply, we are doing that work, yes. I mean if that\u2019s \u2013 if I\u2019ve understood you question, do we have the responsibility? We do, and we're working with, of course we have some major contractors that have work in country as those Pratt & Whitney which we don't oversee. Pratt & Whitney has their own responsibility for that. ","So we are the agents reassigning the work and we've been working on it for some time. But in terms of the risk associated with it, we have a contract modification from the U.S. government that covers all that risk. Because this is a decision by the U.S. government to take Turkey out of the program and so for that purpose, even though we are the ones that are reassigning the work, we have coverage from the contract at the same point. ","Ken, I think it might be helpful also to kind of give some color on the rest of the work that we have in Turkey at this point. ","Ken Possenriede","You bet. Good morning Myles. You know we had the disclaimer in our earnings release talking about you know 2020 no impact to our related to Turkey. Let me just give you some color and I\u2019ll take about four areas. ","So the first one is and this is, one of it is related to F-35 so its exports and so this is the delivery of aircraft to Turkey for the F-35 program and that's by far the largest item here. And I think you know our F-35 contract with Turkey is a partner agreement, so you know they are one of the partner countries through the U.S. government. ","We have - the U.S. government has documented that Lockheed Martin will not absorb any impact from planes we\u2019ve built or are currently building for Turkey. So we believe we are covered here, and I\u2019m sure you saw on our balance sheet some growth in our contract assets. Part of that growth is because we're still working through with the U.S. government to get a contract mark from them for this work, so we can bill and collect for that. Other exports to Turkey from the other business areas really are not material, so there's really no impact to us there. ","The second item is we have a few Turkish military programs that would be impacted by any continuing imposition of the sanctions and work returns, currently reviewing them to determine the financial impact; and one of which is we have a \u2013 it could potentially have to get back a cash advance, an advance payment that's not material in nature and we do know that any inability to perform due to U.S. government sanctions, we would have a backlog adjustment. Think of that as about $900 million you know ball park, that\u2019s in $1 billion, but that\u2019s more a you know a book keeping element at this stage, but net-net on these Turkish military programs for 2020, we don't see any real impact to sales, our profits or our cash, even the cash advances, it would not be material to us. ","The third area is we have a joint venture in Turkey with a company called the Alpata Group; it\u2019s the Alp Aviation. Think of that as Alp manufacturers finished precision parts and mechanical assemblies and have scope for the F-35 and Black Hawk production, and we have an equity stake in this joint venture and think of that as about $40 million. ","We also recognize equity earnings and they are less than $10 million a year, so really not a large amount. So you know at this time if Alp would be prohibited from selling component parts to the Ministry of National Defense, however unless reciprocal sanctions are implemented, Alp should be able to continue to sell component parts to support this. They won't be for F-35; we're working through that. This is for Pratt & Whitney components, we\u2019re working through that. So right now we don't think to be a material impact there either. ","And then the last one is the Turkish suppliers that are actually supporting U.S. programs and that's more than just F-35. So you know the way the sanctions are written, transactions and activities for the conduct of the official business of UST by Lockheed Martin, they'd still be authorized. But independent of the sanctions we're still working second source supply contract as Marillyn mentioned and they are underway and we are working that to wind those down in the 2020 time period. ","And as Marillyn mentioned, we've been partnering closely with the U.S. government and our supply chain to minimize the impact on the F-35 program. We've been working hard to establish alternate sources of supply in the U.S. The first \u2013 second choices will all be U.S. based to quickly as possible to accommodate Turkey's current contributions for the program and we\u2019ll continue working with the U.S. government to understand any potential impacts. ","Lastly, you know even if the current sanctions are lifted, we\u2019re mindful of the potential for congressional legislation or the implication of CAATSA, which is the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act related to Turkey\u2019s purchase and that\u2019s due to the S-400 system, but we\u2019d speculating at this time at any impacts at this point. So hopefully that helped to answer the question. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies; please go ahead. ","Sheila Kahyaoglu ","Good morning Marillyn and Ken! Thank you very much.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu ","In the past you've talked about a three year cash flow target and with operating cash flow bought in 2020 expansion contribution. How do we think about the longer term drivers of free cash flow and the off-set in \u201821 given a pension step-up and just moving pieces on CapEx and working capital. I\u2019m asking you to build a model Ken, so.","Ken Possenriede","Okay, thanks Sheila. You know so if you go back, I think Bruce [ph] teased us up about a year ago and what he saw you know based on what we did on our long range plan, about $7 billion \u2013 he said $7 billion in 2020, 2021 and you know right now as we see $7.2 billion with inclusive of the $500 million pension contribution. I\u2019ll remind everybody, that\u2019s up about $300 million. ","The pension contribution is up about $300 million due to the returns we had in 2018. So we've done a nice job working our way through working capital and I mentioned you know six months ago, seven months ago that that\u2019s a priority of ours this year. ","You know the best we could see this year right now for 2021 and 2022, we will be north of $7 billion. Not sure how much north of $7 billion, but we\u2019ll be north of $7 billion and right now it looks like our pension contribution is out in 2021 and 2022 based on you know the assumptions we\u2019ve made would be about $2 billion in pensions. ","So again, I think we've done a nice job of continuing to grow our cash and you know we'll refine that over the next couple of months and when we give you guidance in January. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Noah Poponak ","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Ken Possenriede","Good morning. ","Noah Poponak ","So just coming back to the 2020 revenue outlook, you know it's a company that grew revenue in a lot of years in the past; five to seven or outlay growth was negative. You know you had this type of growth where you were projecting a 5% type growth rate, 2016, 2017 when outlays were still declining. You know you did something closer to 10, 2018, 2019 when the bookings really started to ratchet up and you've now got the trailing 12 month book-to-bill and the recent backlog growth basically is as good as it's ever been in history the company, trailing 12 month Book-to-bill at 1.5. ","So unless it is a longer dated backlog than ever or if there's just a handful of specific programs that come out of the P&L completely in 2020 that were already out of the backlog, you gave a pretty extensive list of new wins recently in the prepared remarks. I'm just struggling mightily to match up this backlog change with this revenue growth projection. ","Ken Possenriede","Well Noah, its Ken. I think I'll take this and I'll try to relieve your struggling the best I can. So you know we talked about backlog. We see back log into this year. Probably it's going to continue to grow based on the orders we believe we're going to receive in the fourth quarter, the biggest one being into the block by once we get that definite size and we're very close, so we\u2019ll be\u2026","Noah Poponak ","So it is going to grow again in the fourth quarter?","Ken Possenriede","Yeah, so $140 billion \u2013 we\u2019ll be up to about $140 billion and you look at the increase we had this year over what our plan was, think of that as about $17 billion. Think of the $17 billion, about $7.5 billion of that were pull-in\u2019s from 2020 into 2019; think of that as the advance AWE. ","We got three years\u2019 worth of quarters this year rather than the one, so that piece is longer. Think of the block by, which is overall $35 billion give or take. That'll be over a three year period. We're going to get to multi-year three in the fourth quarter for the C-130. That is over a longer period of time. ","If I go back to the $17 billion, the remainder is about $9.5 billion. Those are just pure upsides that we did not plan for. So we have guided from the start of the year to now, increased our guidance by $2.6 billion. Think of that $2.6 billion came from the $9.5 billion of upside of orders that we had and back to your comment, in the $140 billion, the gestation period if I could call it that, is a longer period than we have historically seen. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi; please go ahead. ","Jon Raviv ","Hey, thanks everyone and good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Hi Jon.","Jon Raviv ","Marillyn, what is your \u2013 kind of a broad question here, but what's your perspective on your position in the industry. I get the sense that there's always some shifts in terms of industrial structure, in terms of who is the platform provider, a platform integrator and technology enabler. Any perspectives on that kind of dynamic and what that means for your \u2013 you know when you say long term growth, you know what is that, is that 22 or do we have a line of sight a little bit beyond that at this point. Thank you. ","A - Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question Jon. I guess you know as I look at where we are today, I mean we have transitioned our portfolio over the last few years, several years, toward a more platform provider. We used as you would call, IS & GS, which was a very strong services component of the portfolio. At the time that we divested that element, we brought in Sikorsky, a platform based program. You know in addition to that, of course we got our sensors, our tactical missiles even though sometimes a lot of components that go on those platforms, but if you just look at it from that standpoint you could even argue to some extent that those are the platforms. ","When you look at the growth for the company, F-35 of course is going to be a major element of growth for the next five to 10 years. We know that from ramping up production for the payment of the aircraft. But in addition to that, when you look at Sikorsky, the CH-53K, the combat rescue helicopter, even the presidential helicopter are all programs that'll be into production and our platforms for us going forward. We've got \u2013 we're looking forward to downstream from hypersonics production that we hope will ramp up. You know we got a lot of developmental wins that we\u2019ve had and we expect to be moving more into production there.","Future of Vertical Lift is another area. When you look at the light and medium lift helicopters that we're competing for on Future of Vertical Lift platform based, our F-16 resurgence, as you heard from Ken, you know we were able to get a handshake agreement on our multiyear three for the C-130J in the last month or so; Orion, which again is another important platform in the Space exploration arena. ","So you know that to us, that is where the elements of growth are and certainly on those platforms we do more than just the frames with our systems and sensors and weapon systems, etcetera that are part of our overall; that's pretty important. ","When you look at just the area of missile defense side, what we\u2019re doing on PAC-3, on THAAD, all of the growth that we see in those arenas, as well as you know Aegis Systems and so I would just argue that you know for us that\u2019s the growth. They all come with autonomy and AI and you know software development elements of them. So those are important and I just \u2013 I don't \u2013 I want to put stomp again. It\u2019s a big win we just had on the Sentinel A4 radar. I mean that was a great win for us as a company to go along with several other radars that we have. So hopefully that answers your question Jon. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to David Strauss with Barclays; please go ahead. ","David Strauss, your line is open. If you\u2019re on mute possibly? ","David Strauss ","Hi, can you hear me?","A - Ken Possenriede","We can, yes. Hi David!","David Strauss ","Okay, great, great, thanks for thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask you about your guidance for the full year for \u201819 since it implies a pretty big margin step down in the fourth quarter. It looks like somewhat close to you know kind of high 9% to 10% for the segments. Can you touch on that? ","And then also on your operating cash flow outlook, as we think about \u201820 and \u201921, can you talk a little bit about working capital? The best I can tell, it seems to imply not much of a working capital improvement in \u2013 you know there\u2019s a fairly big working capital burn in \u201820 again also, but you know also the working capital build in \u201919. Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","You bet! Okay David, its Ken, I'll take that. So I\u2019ll go around the business areas for the fourth quarter on margins. So at aeronautics, we\u2019re seeing similar margins that we\u2019ve basically had for the rest of the year, so I think that aeronautics is in line with the rest of the year.","Missiles and Fire Control, your right, it is down, and if you recall what we talked about in the first and the second quarter, we had step-ups of risk retirement planned in the third and the fourth quarter and based on where we were in the production cycle of those products, it made sense for us to do those risk retirements earlier in the year than later in the year. And if you compare that to last year from a timing standpoint, we had more step-ups in the fourth quarter than we\u2019re going to have this year. So it\u2019s just basically timing of you know the production cycle on missiles and Fire Control. ","RMS is like aeronautics. Its similar sales growth, similar profit growth, so that's in line with pretty much with what we've done in previous years. And then lastly Space, it\u2019s similar to missiles and Fire Control and I\u2019ll give a plug to our Advanced EHF program. They are having an absolute tremendous year. They had enormous risk retirements in the year and we're just not going to replicate that out in the fourth. Also ULA earnings will be lower in the fourth quarter this year compared to earlier and last year. ","And then on cash, so you know I think I have a different view David. We are going to reduce working capital significantly in fourth quarter. We had to build-up in the first half of the year and in the third quarter we only grew working capital by $30 million and line of site for 2020 right now with the 5% growth, we're only see growing working capital by about a $100 million and most of that will be in contract assets and in inventory. ","So as we continue to focus on working capital, we are seeing the improvements here and that\u2019s why we too our trend data from $7 billion to $7.2 billion and when Sheila asked the question for the out years, we see a line of site of doing better than what we forecasted in 2021 and 2022 on cash basis, relative to what we disclosed last year. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company; please go ahead. ","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So you\u2019ve had a lot of good growth in terms of wins and hypersonics; you mentioned Skunk Works. Can you give us some numbers in terms of what percentage is classified work of your sales today and the expected growth rate next year and then kind of tied into this whole issue, some of us has felt that the sales growth number would be a little bit higher for next year. If you were going to have an opportunity in sales next year where would it be? Thanks so much. ","Ken Possenriede","You bet Cai. Yeah, unfortunately our customer frowns upon us, spiking at our classified. But what I can say is you know just based on what we're seeing and what I described earlier, you know because of the Skunk\u2019s and because of the classified program at Missiles and Fire Control, they are growing faster than the corporation and I would say that is one of the opportunities that we do have. ","I'd say the other opportunity and again I think I gave color on the last call in terms of hypertonic sales. So we see sales this year in hypertonic around $600 million. Best of what we see today, best of our ability to what we see today is for next year hypersonic round numbers, it's about $1 billion. But just for everybody's benefit, these are not for the most part program of record. ","As Marillyn mentioned, we are still in the prototype phase and we\u2019ll start doing first launches starting next year out into it 2022. It is possible that you know because of the investments we've made in strike\u2019s hypersonics and in counter hypertonics, which really haven't been any program yet on counter hypersonics. ","There is some likelihood we may see some opportunities there in counter hypertonics as well. So it could be in classified and it could be in counter hypertonics. ","Marillyn Hewson","I would just add, you know when you look at growth, I mean this year we are planning to deliver 131 F-35. It\u2019s going to ramp up to over 140 and so that still continues to be our big growth area and then as mentioned earlier the Sikorsky program was CH-53K and CRH and the combat rescue helicopter and our missile defense was PAC-3 and THAAD. Those are the key growth areas as we look at them and continue to grow in F-16, C-130, as well as the hypertonics growth. ","So we got a lot of solid growth programs. I think you know strong 5% growth is you know as I look over the history of our corporation over the last 10 years, I feel really good about the growth that we are seeing as we go into 2020. ","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. ","Peter Arment ","Yeah! Good morning Marillyn and Ken. Ken, I guess this question is for you. We're really testing your long-term forecasting here. But I guess when I look at Aeronautical margins, if we look back at the last cycle you know, the segment kind of peak around with F-22 production, and you know does the same apply here when we're thinking about F-35 deliveries or is this now changing just given the growth you're highlighting with Skunks and some of the sustainment work that's ramping. Just maybe, just a profile of how you think about margin profiles in the improvements that we kind of evolve in the forecasting? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","You bet. So Peter, thanks for the question. Yeah, I'll start with 2020. Again, it just summarized that we're seeing similar margins at Aeronautics next year than we saw this year. I'd say you got the sustainment which as we've mentioned, and you probably seen in the press, will continue to grow, but for the most part of annual buys, and we put a proposal, an unsolicited proposal on the table for a 5 year PBL. So think of that as performance-based logistics. ","There is some interest in the government; we're working through that now, socializing that now. That would give us an opportunity for sustainment and not be dilutive to margins, and so think of that as we're putting more risk on industry, so industry would invest, industry would commit to the metrics and with that there should be additional rewards.","So I think the opportunity also in Aeronautics would be as once these classified program in the Skunk\u2019s starts getting multiple customers and it starts going into production. There should be some margin improvement there that could be similar to margins on the rest of Aeronautics that would help with some margin expansion there.","And as I've mentioned earlier on the F-35 production deals, we feel good with the deals we're getting with the customer. We think they're fair and reasonable, they're balanced and we're now going through some housekeeping on the Block buy and hopefully we have that definitized in the next week or two, and we'll start performing on that. And if we perform, there is opportunity for margin expansion there as well.","Operator","Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Melius Research; [lease go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, thanks for the time. Just a couple, just quick ones here in the interest of time. One, Ken, on the program charge you called out in the release on MFC, was that related to the same program you guys have disclosed before or was that something new? ","And then secondly on the F-16 pipeline, what \u2013 you know from a production rate standpoint or I guess aggregate volume standpoint, what do you see beyond what you've talked about here and the 30 aircraft and potentially going to other customers? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","Thanks Carter. I'll hit the second one first and then I'll do the charge, because that will be probably a less of a long-winded answer. ","So F-16, you know right now in backlog as Marillyn mentioned, we have 30 aircraft. First one gets delivered, Bahrain gets delivered. I had to be in the same country by last day of the year of 2021. We see production build of roughly one month. Right behind that we're hopeful \u2013 you've probably seen in the press, Bulgaria. Bulgaria once \u2013 it looks like they won eight aircraft, so we're in the process of working through that.","In our plan we see countries like Morocco and other countries out in the Far East that in aggregate could grow our backlog by another 60 aircraft, and if you think through that, that will start ramping up that production line to three a month. ","There is other interest out there, the countries in the Middle East. There is discussion about another country in the Far East that could want as many as 66, and we'll see where that goes, but all those aircraft would be built in Greenville and right now we think we have capacity to build four a month, and like I said, we'll start with one a month and that would be frankly good problem to have.","The other wild card is, we've announced our Indian variant that we're going to propose, which is the F-21. We're going to build that airplane in India if we're fortunate enough to win that program, but that program would be worth $10 billion to $15 billion, so great opportunity out there. There is other mod work out there as well, that there are customers that will elect to keep their current aircraft and will modify those aircraft, so we see a great future for F-16. ","Regarding the charge we took at Missiles and Fire Control, it actually is \u2013 it is actually a different program than what we had. It was a modest charge and we think from a performance standpoint with balance sheet reserves and the charge we took, we think we won't be talking about that program anymore.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel; please go ahead.","Joe DeNardi","Yeah, thanks, good afternoon. Maybe Marillyn or Ken, I think it seems like international demand for F-35 has maybe pleased you guys positively or had been a positive surprise of late as the prices come down there. Can you just talk about what the pipeline looks there? ","And then what the conversations are with the DoD in terms of what peak production would be? I think at one point there were some discussion about taking it to 182 to 185, just a little more color there. Thank you.","Ken Possenriede","Sure, I'll take that Joe. So yeah, we are very happy with where the F-35 program is going internationally. You saw Japan announced an additional 105 aircraft, on top of the aircraft they originally committed to. Singapore has announced an interest in buying the aircraft. It will be for a modest amount to start, but that's a great start. ","And Japan actually said they want to buy some Bs [ph]. It's likely Singapore who will buy some Bs. We're pleased with the award we got for Belgium for 34 aircraft. We are in a competition now for Finland and Switzerland, will continue to shape those and you're exactly right we got to the $80 million aircraft earlier than we thought. It's in lot 13 which will certainly help with those opportunities.","We're in the competition with Canada, which could buy up to 100 aircraft. We're feeling good about that. We don't think we're out of the German competition yet, so we're still continuing to shape that. We heard about Poland. Poland wants to buy 32 aircraft, so we think there is a strong pipeline out there for the F-35. ","Regarding capacity, you got it, right. So if you look at the FACO the final assembly and checkout at Fort Worth, the one in Italy and the one in Japan, we see capacity right now as we continue to build that out in Fort Worth to be about 180, 185 aircraft. So we got ways to go.","Greg Gardner ","Hey John, this is Greg. I think we\u2019ve come up on the top of the hour here, so I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks Greg. Well, let me just end by restating that we really completed another strong quarter of financial and operational performance, and as you heard we have a record backlog, we are focused on program execution and with a strong demand for our portfolio of products and services. We believe we're well positioned for a successful closure of 2019 and continued growth in 2020. ","So we appreciate you all joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry Kircher","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you join us to review our first quarter results. As today\u2019s release outlined, we had another solid quarter operationally and financially. The corporation continues to deliver critical solutions and products to our customers, while also returning value to our stockholders. I am extraordinarily proud of the efforts and focus of our team and their significant accomplishments across the corporation.","And looking at the results for the quarter, we achieved or exceeded our expectations. I am very pleased that strong year-to-date financial performance across multiple business areas enables us to increase 2015 full year guidance for operating profit and earnings per share. In addition to these increases to guidance, we reaffirmed our earlier outlook for full year orders, sales and cash from operations. In addition to these solid financial results, we have continued to return value to stockholders in the areas of share repurchases and dividend payments through our cash deployment initiatives.","In the quarter, we repurchased over $600 million of our shares and remain committed to achieving the goal we outlined earlier this year to repurchase at least $2 billion of our shares in 2015 market conditions permitting. This ongoing repurchase program enables us to progress on our related goal of reducing total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. These repurchases combined with our quarterly dividend repayment returned over $1.1 billion in cash to stockholders this quarter.","Turning briefly to DoD budgets, in early February, the President released his proposed fiscal year 2016 base defense budget at $534 billion, reflecting a request with $35 billion more than the spending limits established in the Budget Control Act. The President also proposed an additional $51 billion in spending for overseas contingency operations, or OCO. Combined, the two proposed spending packages totaled $585 billion and if enacted represent a significant increase in total funding for defense above prior year levels.","In March, budget resolutions were passed by both houses of Congress that outlined total defense spending level that equals or slightly exceeds the amount requested by the President. The congressional resolutions are a bipartisan recognition of the need for greater investment in defense spending to respond to increasing global security threats, aging military assets and the imperative to improve the readiness of our Armed Forces. The resolutions left in place, the Budget Control Act sequestration cuts to the Defense Department space budget, while increasing funding for the OCO, overseas contingency operations. This approach is intended to enable utilization of funds from the OCO to pay for other defense items outside the normally restricted war-related costs specified in the OCO. While it is too early to predict the final level of FY \u201816 defense budgets, it is encouraging that the President and Congress are aligned in their recognition of the need to increase defense spending from the recent constrained levels. We look forward to finalization of congressional budget deliberations which are expected to be completed later this year.","Moving outside the DoD budgets, momentum continues to build with respect to our strategy to expand international business and the success of this strategy remains a priority to me and the corporation. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to travel to multiple countries in Europe and the Middle East to participate in wide ranging discussions on our spectrum of products and services and the increasingly complex geopolitical environment, which requires proven and adaptive solutions at home and abroad. In Europe, I had the opportunity to participate in the Munich Security Conference on international security policy. This meeting included extensive discussions on current and future security challenges and included attendees from more than 70 countries who exchanged views on defense requirements.","Well, in the Middle East, I was able to travel to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates where I met with senior government leaders who discussed these current and future regional security issues they face and how we might work with them to address their requirements. These discussions reinforced my belief that our international growth strategy is sound and working. There is an acute need on the part of international customers for an increasingly wide range of our products and services as the geopolitical environment becomes more complex and less predictable. These expanding requirements further position the corporation to achieve our goal of generating at least 25% of annual sales from international customers in the next few years.","I would like to move to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide a brief summary on the progress of the program that we are achieving and reaching key milestones and securing new business from international customers. Recent production milestone accomplishments included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft from the final assembly and check out facility in Italy. This represents the first time an F-35 has been assembled outside the United States. It also demonstrates the ability of the Italian facility to complete the fifth generation stealth aircraft and underscores the global partnerships within the F-35 program. Beyond this production accomplishment, the flight test program continues to progress with completion at the 1,000 sortie at Luke Air Force Base, the 500 sortie at Nellis Air Force Base and the overall F-35 fleet surpassing 30,000 flight hours.","These events highlight the increasing tempo of flight operations across the country at an expanding number of sites. New business support of the program continue to grow internationally this quarter with letters of acceptance signed by Israel for 14 additional aircraft and by Turkey for four aircraft. Additionally, the Netherlands placed an order for its first batch of eight production aircraft. These recent actions reflect the expanding commitments by international countries to secure this fifth generation aircraft for their future fighter fleets. It\u2019s noteworthy that the program of record identifies over 700 aircraft to be acquired by 11 international countries and illustrates the strong future demand for the F-35 by our allies. Almost half of the projected annual orders over the next 5 years are scheduled to be placed by international customers, demonstrating the importance of international participation on the program.","Turning to the development program, we have continued to finalize the software that will enable initial operating capability or IOC of the STOVL aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps later this year and are also progressing on the software that will enable the Air Force variant aircraft to achieve IOC in 2016. This past quarter, we successfully conducted initial flight test of the enhanced software that will be used to provide IOC to carrier variant aircraft. The commencement of these flights with this software is the key element to enable us to provide this revolutionary aircraft to the U.S. Navy in 2018. Overall, the F-35 program is retiring development risk, increasing the production tempo and securing new contract awards as we expand our activities on the program.","Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to highlight two noteworthy milestones that occurred earlier this month in our aeronautics business and a key event this past quarter in our Mission Systems and Training business. On the Aeronautics C-130 program, we were enormously proud to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the rollout and first flight of the inaugural production C-130 Hercules in April 1955. With almost 2,500 C-130s delivered around the world to 63 countries, it remains the world\u2019s most fielded cargo aircraft. The C-130 program has the sole distinction as the world\u2019s longest, continuously operating military production line.","Since the debut of the A model 60 years ago, the C-130 has incorporated multiple model revisions, product improvements and upgrades, and it\u2019s evolution to the J version produced today. This 60-year history of continuous improvement also created demand by commercial customers seeking to reconstitute their aging L-100 airlifter fleets with a new LM-100J version extending the footprint of its program beyond domestic and international government customers.","On the C-5M program, a super galaxy aircraft recently established 45 pending new world records in airlift capabilities. And after the results are certified, we will hold a new total of 86 aeronautics records. Our upgrade program to install 25% more powerful and fuel-efficient engines on the aircraft has significantly enhanced the ability of the C-5M to reach speeds at a faster rate than predecessor versions and enable cargo transport over longer distance between refueling. We are very proud of our upgrade actions on this airlifter as we deliver expanded strategic air mobility capabilities to world fighters. With unmatched flexibility, versatility and relevance, the C-130 and C-5 aircraft will continue to provide essential airlift service for our nation and international users for years to come.","Turning to Mission Systems and Training, in February, we were honored to participate with the Air Force at the groundbreaking ceremony at Kwajalein Atoll to mark the start of the construction for the Space Fence radar system. This ground-based radar system will improve the way objects are tracked in orbit and increase the ability to predict and prevent space-based collisions. The multi-year program will also serve as one of the drivers for future sales growth in the MST business area as we deliver this critical enhancement to our national capabilities.","I will now ask Bruce to go through the details of the first quarter financial performance and our increased 2015 guidance and then we will open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Beginning with Chart 3, we have an overview of our first quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $10.1 billion and this was in line with our expectations. We will provide more color on our sales results on the next chart. Our segment operating margin was better than expected in the quarter at 12.9% and enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $2.74. We generated $957 million in cash from operations also in line with our expectations, but lower than we have historically generated in the first quarter. We will discuss the quarterly phasing of our projected cash from operations for the year in a few charts. Our cash deployment actions remain strong with $1.1 billion of cash return to shareholders, including more than $600 million in share repurchases. And because of our operating performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year outlook for both operating profit and earnings per share. So, I think we are off to a very solid start to 2015.","On Chart 4, we compared our first quarter sales results for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales are lower by about 5% compared with the first quarter of last year, but as you recall, we said that this was our expectation during the January call. The lower sales level was driven primarily by two business areas, Missiles and Fire Control and Aeronautics. In both cases, fewer deliveries drove the reductions, PAC-3 and tactical missile deliveries and Missiles and Fire Control and three fewer aircraft deliveries in aeronautics. We remain on track to achieve the sales outlook we provided at the beginning of the year.","Chart 5 compares our segment operating margin this quarter with the first quarter of 2014. Segment operating margin was 50 basis points lower this quarter compared with the same period last year, but remained near historically high levels. Three of the five business areas had higher margins this year than in the first quarter of 2014 with Space Systems having the largest increase due to higher risk retirements. Mission Systems and Training had a strong performance quarter, but was unable to match its near record level margin results from the first quarter of last year.","IS&GS\u2019 margin was down considerably from last year at this time, though we had expected a fairly large reduction when we provided our outlook for the year in January. The first quarter results were lower than expected due to performance issues on an international program. Results from the rest of the IS&GS portfolio of programs were stronger than expected and we are able to offset much, but not all of the impacts of this program. Overall, our performance was better than expected and resulted in our increase in segment operating profit for the full year.","Turning to Chart 6, we will review our earnings per share results this quarter with our results from a year ago. Our EPS of $2.74 was $0.13 lower than the results from last year, but higher than our expectations and because of this, we increased our EPS for the year as we will discuss in a few charts.","Chart 7 provides details into our cash deployment actions during the quarter. And as we previously mentioned, we repurchased more than $600 million of our shares in the quarter, more than we had planned in our initial guidance projections and combined with dividends paid of nearly $500 million when we returned $1.1 billion of cash to our stockholders or 131% of our free cash flow in the quarter. We expect to have a larger amount of share repurchases in the second quarter, utilizing the greater level of cash we have on the balance sheet as a result of the debt issuance we had in late February.","On Chart 8, we discuss our updated outlook for our full year 2015 results. We are not changing our guidance for either orders or sales at this time, though orders in the first quarter were slightly ahead of our expectations. Sales, as we mentioned earlier, were as we expected in the quarter. We are increasing our profit projections by $50 million as a result of our strong performance in the first quarter. We are also increasing our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, but there are several moving pieces that deserve more explanation and we will provide that on the next chart.","We are leaving our cash from operations guidance unchanged, but I do want to mention that our phasing this year will look different compared to our results in recent years. We expect that our quarterly cash phasing will be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year with as much as two-thirds of our cash coming in the last two quarters of the year. We expect this phasing in part because our cash collections will mirror the increased delivery rates we expect throughout the rest of the year, and we anticipate reaching final agreement on a number of contracts in the second half of the year that will bring cash collections with them.","Chart 9 provides a reconciliation between our prior EPS outlook and our current expectations. The increase in our segment operating profit outlook will increase our expected EPS by $0.11 per share. As we previously mentioned, our share repurchase activity in the first quarter was slightly higher than we had planned and we also had a lower level of options exercised in the quarter than we were expecting. The combination of these two items results at a lower average share count level than our previous projections and improves our estimated EPS for the year by $0.07. We now project our full year average share count will be just over 315 million shares. Offsetting these EPS increases is the additional interest for the remainder of the year for the debt issuance that closed in February. Netting these changes together, we now expect our EPS for the year will be $0.05 higher than we guided in January to a new range of $10.85 to $11.15 per share.","On Chart 10, we provide our sales outlook by business area for the year with no change from the outlook we provided in January. Chart 11 shows our current outlook for segment operating profit compared with what we were expecting last quarter. We increased our profit outlook in four of our five business areas with Space Systems having the largest increase for the year at $30 million. The other three business areas for each increased by $10 million to $15 million and we lowered our expected full year profit for IS&GS by $20 million for the reasons we previously discussed. And the net change for the company was a $50 million increase in our segment operating profit outlook.","Finally, Chart 12 provides our summary of the quarter. We are off to a solid start for the year with our results either tracking to or exceeding our expectations for the first quarter. We remain committed to our cash deployment actions to generate returns for our stockholders and the breath and strength of our portfolio will enable us to achieve these results.","With that, we are ready for questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning Marillyn and Bruce.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","How are you?","Peter Arment","Bruce could you, I guess give us a little \u2013 if you can give us a little more color on the \u2013 you said the $70 million adjustment or lower profit I guess accrual in IS&GS in the quarter from the international program?","Bruce Tanner","Sure. I will start and if Marillyn has something to add to this, she will surely do so. So this was a fairly good sized international program. One of our sort of commanding control entrance that we are selling internationally, this was a pretty complex system that we were developing under Iran and as we got into the actual integration of this system in country that turned out to be more complicated than we originally anticipated. We think the charge that we took in the first quarter has this effort, I will say sized appropriately for the remaining work to be done. But I think importantly, we also think that there is a greater market potential for this product once it\u2019s installed and it\u2019s showing its capabilities. So we are optimistic there is a chance for future profitable sales with this impact or with this product going forward. I think the good news in the quarter with an IS&GS is there \u2013 if there were a number of performance improvements in the rest of the portfolio, so the way I kind of think about it is we have one issue, one fairly large issue on a large program that was offset by a sort of a number of improvements across the rest of the portfolio or maybe said it differently, but for that IS&GS, we have had a very strong quarter except for that one contracts.","Marillyn Hewson","I don\u2019t have anything more to add other than just to say that the contract size is less than $500 million, so just to keep it in perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Rob Spingarn","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi Rob.","Rob Spingarn","I just wanted to follow-up on the profit side. Your margin guidance is generally below your performance in all the segments than what you saw in the first quarter, especially when you made the adjustment in IS&GS for the $70 million, so was there anything other than conservatism baked in there?","Bruce Tanner","Rob, I don\u2019t think that we have consciously tried to bake either conservatism or optimism in there. We always start every year by saying that or at least I think I do by saying that we think we have the potential as we go throughout the year to have similar levels of risk retirements and profit pickups through the year as we had in prior years. This issue that it is on the international program and IS&GS is the thing that sort of proves that that\u2019s it can sometimes go both ways there. So these are not just given, this is not just conservatism as we go throughout the rest of the year. As we look forward, I think the timing of risk events \u2013 there tend to be the back end has a few less events than we have had in the first part of the year. We also had in particular, with the Space Systems for instance, significantly higher weighted ULA equity earnings in the first quarter as compared to the whole year. I want to say, if you look at on a percentage basis, probably 45% of the equity earnings for Space Systems occurred in the first quarter and the remaining 55% or so will be spread over the next three quarters. So it\u2019s just a lot of facing. We did have a couple of \u2013 within the business areas a couple of sort of contractual or administrative settlements that happened in the first quarter that we are not expecting to materialize in the next three quarters as we sit here today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.","Rich Safran","Hi, good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Rich Safran","Marillyn, I heard your remarks about the budget at the opening. If so, if we assume for just a moment that the FY \u201816 budget is above the spending caps maybe closer to the request or if OCO funds are applied, I wanted to know if you had the sense of what the priorities would be for any additional funds where there might be upside to Lockheed Martin programs, is this the kind of thing that would impact your short cycle business at IS&GS or is this long cycle business or maybe both?","Marillyn Hewson","So, first of all, I mean in terms of the budget itself, you are right, the President base budget is significantly above the Budget Control Act sequestration budget caps that were out there. And but just to remind you, those limits still remain in place from FY \u201816 and beyond. So it\u2019s important that Congress address that as they move forward and they took a stab at it with these solutions by increasing the OCO in order to fund some additional spending, but until they do some statutory change, that really doesn\u2019t change the sequestration that\u2019s out there. So we really need the President to consent to these \u2013 to the OCO offers that they have and he wants an increase in both defense and domestic spending cuts I mean cap, so we know that\u2019s the case.","However, back to your question about what it means for us, certainly F-35 and C-130Js are important. In fact, if you looked at what\u2019s comes through on the unfunded priorities list, there are six F-35Bs on that list coming in from the Marine Corps and another eight F-35s or Cs for the Navy that are on the unfunded priorities list. So to the extent that additional funding is found that\u2019s important. Moreover on the C-130, there are another 13 aircraft there and the KC-130J have another two aircraft. And then there is a number of other items that have additional funding that are in our portfolio as we go forward.","I would just say that in terms of long cycle versus short cycle business, it\u2019s you hit right on, I mean building an aircraft, doing a long lead funding and going through the production process, we are well over 3 years on our aircraft and when they are in development even longer than that with the F-35. And so as we get things lined up, it\u2019s as we get funded for these then that business there is just a long cycle business that will be in our portfolio, will be in our backlog and that\u2019s important. A lot of things also are related to what happens with our troops and what\u2019s going on in the various conflicts around the world and so we will just have to watch how that transpires as well as to what kind of funding that Congress and the DoD in order to address those continuing threats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Hi, good morning Marillyn and Bruce and Jerry. Thank you for your remarks.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Howard Rubel","Marillyn, there has been countless headlines about all the challenges the F-35 faces, some of them are history that people like to dredge up and talk about things that you have already solved in terms of problems. And then there are things that you are still wrestling with everyday, can you kind of bring us to the point where we understand how to ignore some of the bad news and how you are coping with some of these issues that still aren\u2019t where you would like them to be?","Marillyn Hewson","Great question. Thank you for that question. We are challenged with that regularly because it is the largest program with the Department of Defense and it\u2019s a complex development program, so it\u2019s challenging in that sense. And every year as you know the GAO comes out with their annual report. There is an OT&E report that comes out annually to Congress. There are a myriad of reports that are required just given the size of the program, so we take every one of those reports into account. We read them all. They are not always exactly right and I think that\u2019s just the facts of the matter. What we try to do is stay focused on performance because that\u2019s the first and foremost thing that we can do to continue to keep this program on track.","I will say from a status standpoint, if you look back at some of the technical challenges we had early on, we have solved the landing hook. We solved the helmet issues. The software programs are going well. So from that perspective, the program is maturing. The development program that we are moving through, we are 65% complete on that. And we're going to continue to ramp up the production. Manufacturing is going well. Last year, we delivered 36 aircraft from 2014 and this year we are going to deliver about 45, so you can see it ramping up. We are going to \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, the initial operating capability, IOC for the Marine Corps, is going to be happening this summer and you have heard from the Marine Corps that they are confident. We are also confident that they will meet their IOC. And so from that perspective, I think the key is to not react to every media write-up is going to say it\u2019s largest program and it will reflect back on initial stages of the program, but if you look at \u2013 since we rebaselined the program in 2010, we have been on track with our cost and our schedule performance.","We have rolled out a blueprint for affordability jointly with the U.S. government that is driving cost down. And by the time we move into full rate production, the cost of the F-35 will be comparable or lower than a fourth generation fighter with much more capabilities. So, I would just encourage you to continue to watch us track through the ramp up of the production, the things we are doing to drive the cost down and as we continue to move through the flight test program. And as each of these services declared their initial operating capability and as we continue to rollout more and more capability to the aircraft, I think that our nation and our allies are going to be very proud to have the requirements, the national security requirements capabilities that this aircraft will provide for many decades to come.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. Aeronautics, help me understand you did 11.8% margin in the first quarter with deliveries expected to get better as we go through the year on the mature programs and yet it looks like the margin goes down. And as I read your commentary, it doesn\u2019t look like there is anything abnormal in terms of the positives, I mean there is that $25 million risk retirement, but so why don\u2019t the aeronautics margins kind of hold near where the first quarter is for the rest of the year?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So, Cai, I will take that one on. I think probably the biggest reason is we have got two things going on there. One, we have a pretty good size ramp obviously on the F-35 program in total as compared to the rest even with the delivery increases that you talked about. So, you have the F-35 dilution effect occurring there. I think what maybe lost a little bit in your question there is C-5 deliveries are expected to increase fairly significantly over the first quarter just in terms of quantities and that\u2019s another program that has a lower margin than the overall aeronautics program in general. And I think the combination of those two is what we are seeing right now offsetting the higher margin we had in the first quarter. But having said that, I still think we are going to end the year at 11% or more and I do think there are \u2013 there is potential that we can do a little better than that of some of the risk retirements break a little early for us or come a little larger than we have in our current outlook.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein","Hey, good morning. Just a quick question for Bruce just a couple of details. When you look at the financials, it looks like this year if you add up your accounts receivables and inventories, divide it by sales, you are running at a little bit of a higher rate, that\u2019s 95% than you historically have. At least for recent history, recent history seems like it\u2019s been more like in the 70% to 80% range. What\u2019s driving that? What\u2019s driving that buildup in working capital?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So, a couple of things, I think if you just look at the first quarter, Ron, we have a historically low AR at the end of the year is sort of the payment offices clean up everything, if you will, on their docket, if you will. A lot of it has to do even with the timing of when we closed the first quarter. So, I think historically, you actually do see that we usually have a spike in our accounts receivable in the first quarter, because of those two phenomenon. Inventory is growing a little bit. And in part, that\u2019s one of the elements I was trying to describe in my prepared remarks that talk about some of the contractual resolutions are contractual finalizations that we are expecting in the second half of the year. We expect to have some collections associated with those as things like our billing arrangements get finalized and the performance-based payments terms get finalized. And so we would expect to have some reduction in our inventory account going forward. At the end of the day, Ron, I think our \u2013 the spike we see in working capital in general for all elements of working capital, not just AR and inventory, we expect that, that will probably come down over the next three quarters of the year and probably end the year, not too differently than where we started the year or ended the year 2014.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason Gursky","Hi, good morning everyone.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Gursky","I just wanted to ask a question about missile defense in the marketplace there today in light of recent awards that have been going on internationally. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics that are going on there and what you think the opportunity that is for Lockheed with the various products you have had and the contribution to Patriot, just kind of update us on the market and what the opportunities are specifically for Lockheed going forward?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, sure. I would just start by saying that it continues to be an expanding demand for missile defense in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East for our products, along the lines of the THAAD, Aegis, Aegis Assure, Patriot, and potentially MEADS as well. As we look at, for example, MEADS, I know there was an announcement today about Raytheon winning the opportunity in Poland, but we have bought Patriot or PAC-3 is part of that system \u2013 that Patriot system. So, it\u2019s an opportunity there for us as well, but we still have an opportunity in Poland that meets international and selected to participate in technical dialogue on a short range air and missile defense system called Narew in Poland and we expect to continue to be in that dialogue. And that\u2019s one that the MEADS system is the only one that offers the capability, network and integrate on a variety of air missile defense system elements, including things that are developed in Poland, their sensors, their command and control, etcetera.","And in Germany in the midst of their evaluation to make their decision on their air and missile defense system and as you know, they have invested a fair amount into the MEADS system along with Italy and the U.S. And so we expect to participate in that opportunity and we hope that they will select, meet as they move forward on their selection. Around the world though, I think there continues to be a very strong demand as you look at Aegis continues to be a demand for Aegis. Aegis Assure we stood up or are in the midst of standing up our Aegis Assure in Romania, we have another in Poland. And so that opportunity in the European theater is also important. There are discussions with \u2013 there is South Korea on both PAC-3 and ultimately on THAAD, interest in the Middle East by a number of countries on PAC-3 and THAAD. So, I think that you are going to continue to see \u2013 continue demand for our portfolio that we have a very strong set of products and capabilities in that arena that\u2019s going to continue to have a demand.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning everybody.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Noah.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Bruce, on the debt you raised intra-quarter, it kind of looks like the interest expense you have added to your full year earnings outlook includes interest on all of that, is that true? And it looks like intra-quarter you were discussing the potential to use some of that to refi. So if you do that, is there an opportunity to later reduce the interest expense for the full year? And then beyond refi, what else are you going to do with this cash?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, good questions, Noah. So, I think the average interest rate for the \u2013 because we did it in three tranches of varying sizes, but the average interest rate is about 3.5%. So, I think to your question \u2013 your first question, I think we are just taking the 3.5% with the last 10.5 months or 9.5 months whatever it is of exposure on the debt. And that is what the interest calculation is for this year. Going forward, we did talk to you, I think on the last \u2013 not on the last call because I\u2019d have the intra-quarter to your point, but I think in the disclosure we did for that we described that we would potentially look at taking out some near-term debt maturities that mature in 2016. We actually have sort of two tranches that happened in 2016. They worth a little less than $1 billion combined and so we would expect that and those are \u2013 one of those at least, as a fairly good sized interest has pretty \u2013 a fairly good sized interest coupon on the debt. So we would expect interest to mitigate some in 2016 as we take out that roughly $1 billion of debt with the proceeds. And then the rest of it is strictly general purpose Noah. And as I try to tee up in the earlier remarks, I do think that we could use the potential for that for additional share repurchases throughout the rest of this year and moving into 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","So Marillyn, you talked a little bit about the \u2013 you reiterated 25% international mix over the next few years, but do you feel like maybe given an improving domestic budget environment right now, that may be that number kind of goes back to the 20% level over the next couple of years if you maybe consider that 25% going higher as maybe a function of maybe worsening domestic environment budgetary conditions, if the domestic budget environment continues to get a little better than we all thought, may be last year at this point, is the international opportunity is that still robust enough for you to get to that 25% level even if domestic is picking up better?","Marillyn Hewson","My answer to that would be yes, absolutely. I mean our backlog today is $20 billion in international backlog at the end of 2014 and that\u2019s a significant backlog for us. The quality and maturity of the portfolio and that we are selling around the world is going to continue to have a demand. And as you probably know what we talked about and I think I even said it in my remarks, over half of the orders on the F-35 are going to be the international customers in the next 5 years. So that program alone is going to continue to grow. Earlier in my comments about missile defense, continued strong demand from missile defense. And we expect countries, besides the countries that are program of record on the F-35 there are going to be others that are going to need to retire their fourth generation aircraft, so we expect other countries to want to procure the F-35. Airlift C-130s and 72 countries and the Js is going to continue to be in demand as some of those countries upgrade their airlift capability to the J. So I would say that we are going to continue to be on a path to get to 25% over the next few years and at the same time as budgets recover and defense will continue to sell within the U.S. So I think both elements of our portfolio will continue to rise. But I do expect just given the backlog and given the opportunities that we have on the international front that we will achieve the 25%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Doug Harned","Thank you. Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning Doug.","Doug Harned","I wanted to go back to IS&GS and I know that you have been getting more international orders, so your backlog has a larger international component and you talked about the issue you had with this one contract, could you describe the kinds of international orders you have been winning are these \u2013 do these tend to be fixed price in nature, which in theory could give you some upside in margin, but also expose you to potentially more risk, I am just interested in so how large international is becoming an IS&GS and what the opportunity and the potential risk might be there?","Bruce Tanner","And so Doug let me try to give you a little color to that. So the international content and IS&GS is growing not leaps and bounds, but it\u2019s growing from a fairly small beginning, I will say toward now I am just thinking of top of my head is probably in the maybe 10%, maybe a little less than that, something like 7% or 10% or so of the sales of IS&GS maybe a little less than that even is what our international content is. But think of that as much higher than it was say 3 years or 4 years ago, so that part of the business is growing. Almost all thinking that there is an exception to that, but I will say almost all the international work that we are doing, not just in IS&GS, but around the whole company is in fact from fixed price efforts, so there is both upside and downside risk associated with doing that which I think a lot of this is sort of doing IT work for us, that\u2019s what we are doing in Australia is not dissimilar than what we are doing with the Pentagon here in the United States, sort of aggregating a lot of the systems and making those systems, doing upgrades, making those systems perform better and doing the overall system development work for all the IT services for \u2013 in this case, the Ministry of Defense or Department of Defense in Australia.","We do a lot of cyber work internationally. We are getting \u2013 that\u2019s a growing portion of the business as the next one that we are very happy to work. I think our reputation is spreading sort of across the globe as we do work for individual countries and in some cases, individual firms within those countries that sort of gets word-of-mouth sales that happen elsewhere. We also do internationally within IS&GS, a lot of airport management or air traffic management type activities, so the things that we do with our FAA business in the United States, think of that is doing it elsewhere, but also a lot of \u2013 sort of productivity sorts of things from an airport perspective internationally. So that\u2019s probably the three big pieces. Well, I should say there is also a little bit of Intel piece, similar \u2013 not dissimilar again to what we do with our Intel customers in the United States. So probably those four pieces Doug you should think of us what we are doing internationally within IS&GS and that portion is growing pretty significantly for us from again a fairly modest start a few years ago to where it is today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning all.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick clarification on that, Bruce with that being 7% to 10% and Marillyn\u2019s comment earlier about less than $500 million, it would make that seem like that\u2019s probably the largest program in IS&GS on the international side, is that correct?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. It\u2019s - I don\u2019t know but it is the largest, Carter. But it's one of the largest that we have, one of probably a couple of that \u2013 for that size. And I was looking at some data here, I think the actual number is slightly less than 10% for IS&GS, a little more specificity than I gave Doug on the previous question.","Carter Copeland","Great. And on the aerospace margin front, you teed up on the prior call and during the quarter some potential upside, you had talked about 100 basis points on the F-35 development contract. And once that sort of got \u2013 the delays from last year worked their way through and also on the C-5 even excluding the over and aboves and I wondered you highlighted the small amount of risk retirements on F-35, but I wondered if you could just give an update on the progress on both of those?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So probably I want to correct something, I think I heard that you say we weren\u2019t talking about development program increases, we were talking about production improvement.","Carter Copeland","Production, correct. Sorry.","Bruce Tanner","So what you saw in the first quarter and what we disclosed in earnings release was one of those risk retirements that we were expecting to happen, that\u2019s actually probably one of the larger ones that will happen throughout the rest of the year at least this planning wise, that\u2019s one of the reasons why the margins in the first quarter were in fact higher than what we expect for the rest of the year. So I think that\u2019s tracking to what I said earlier and what I had talked about the potential 100 basis point improvement in the production program year-over-year from \u201814 to \u201915, I still think is doable and on track as we sit here today. C-5, we talked about that program in the past about the potential for a step up over time. I still think that\u2019s the path that we are looking at doing in the latter part of the year. And again as you alluded to and I will make the comment, none of those considers the potential for some entitlement actions that we have relative to the over and above work that would be separate and distinct from this. This is just sort of recognizing that we are doing a better job of sort of turning out the aircraft in the short-term cycles and the like that are resulting in better performance on that contract for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton","Great. Thanks and good morning. The question I had was on space and in particular the margin performance you had in the first quarter and I think you have about $125 million of headwind on ULA for the rest of the year, so I get that, but it does look like certainly the risk retirements at Orion and the government side and probably across the portfolio are better than we have seen in a while. So I am just curious usually good things follow good things, was there a certain risk retirement related to Orion and government programs? Were you reaching kind of critical milestones or is Space just looking like it\u2019s probably going to be a source of continued upside for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yes, so good question, Myles, you should think of Space Systems as having a couple of risk retirements that happened in the first quarter. One of them was associated with the Orion vehicle. This was actually associated with the launch we did last year as we sort of finalized the results of that in the first quarter of this year. We kind of trued up our booking position if you will for that event and that resulted in a step up associated with that event that will not repeat itself obviously in the next three quarters. We also had some \u2013 a couple of one-offs in the quarter for things like some reliability incentives that we had at least one of the contracts within Space Systems, if not another one. And that just happened to fall in the first quarter, if you will. So, we have got a pretty good increase associated with that reliability incentives and that also reflected part of the effort this quarter that won\u2019t happen going forward. I will also remind you that as you said the latter three quarters of the year we have the ULA totally different profile than what we have had last quarter. And again as I made comments earlier much lower equity earnings going forward as compared to the first quarter.","I will also remind you though that we do have what\u2019s left as sort of the restructuring costs that are not \u2013 that have not been taken, but are reflected in our operating performance and those will continue to happen in the next three quarters without the benefit of the step-ups that we took in the first quarter. So, combined I know there is a lot of moving pieces I just gave you there, but combined is that\u2019s why we look at the margins doing what they do in the next three quarters for Space Systems. What I will say though is Space Systems is performing very, very well right now. And so I look at that and say there is the potential for opportunity as we go forward every year we do have opportunity and we are performing very, very well on our government contracts and Space Systems. There is a lot of incentive-based contracts there, where if we do well we obviously get the margins associated with that, but the government gets flipside of those incentive contracts as well. And so we are performing very well there. And I think we have some potential to do even better going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard from RBC.","Rob Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Stallard","Bruce, I was wondering \u2013 just quick question on the book-to-bill. I was wondering if you could comment on the various trends that you are seeing there, particularly down the short cycle side and when we might see some improvement in perhaps the IS&GS book-to-bill through this year?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So, Rob, maybe I will just give you \u2013 I thought that there might be a question on orders, so maybe I will just give you sort of a little bit of a full overview of where we sit from orders perspective. Sort of it, it has been our history at least the last few years, we are going to be significantly back-end weighted in our orders for the year. And as we sit here today, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there is probably 65% or so of the orders that we are expecting to have for the year will actually materialize in the second half of the year. And you should think about \u2013 we have got quite a few big ticket items to sort of keep your eye on, so we have got the bomber awards some time in the summer of this year. We have got finalization of the C-130J multiyear. We have got the next production lot, Lot 9 of the F-35 program occurring. And with that \u2013 and it\u2019s just a lot of contracts, but they add up to a lot of dollars individually \u2013 or collectively, they add up to a lot of dollars, just a whole lot the various F-35 sustainment contracts and long lead contracts for future LRIPs. And you combine that with a lot of the international orders we are looking at for THAAD and PAC-3, for instance and you see there is some pretty big chunky sized orders coming in the next three months, but more weighted with second half of the year. I didn\u2019t mention JLTV, but that\u2019s obviously another critical strategic win. So, the big strategic items we are looking for from a competitive perspective this year are the bomber award and JLTV.","To your specific question on IS&GS, I think we are going to \u2013 last year, we actually grew backlog in IS&GS which was the first time we have done that for a while. As we look forward, I think the IS&GS orders are probably sequentially going to grow and get close to the sales value, but probably not as much as the sales for the year, so we will probably have some reduction in our backlog in IS&GS as we close the year. In part because we did recall, we did get so many orders in 2014 that were sort of multi-year orders that won\u2019t be replicated, if you will in 2015. Just \u2013 and maybe one last comment, we still think as we sit here today and we said this for a couple of years in a row, we do think we are on a track to get back similar to where we started at the end of last year about $80 plus million level for total backlog for the corporation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. Bruce, I was wondering if you could talk a little more, you talked about the phasing just now of the orders you have done it on the cash flow, can you talk a little bit about maybe the earnings as we go through the year. And then also the buyback activity should it be fairly ratable at this $600 million and related to that, you mentioned the options exercise, is there a point where we start to see the share count really move down when we get to the other side of those options, is that this year?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Of course, we will try to hit all of those for you Sam. So overall margins, I think we had a bit of a spike, probably not unlike what we did last year, frankly as the corporation, I think we came down from a pretty high first quarter and we dropped the next 3 quarters. A lot of that\u2019s just the phasing and timing of when we get some of our awards and some of our incentives on our contracts across all of the business areas. So I would expect margins would be probably lower over the next three quarters. I think the second and third quarters will probably be similar to each other whereas the fourth we could have a little bit higher margin. So thinking of the second and third, probably running in the low-11s and maybe as we sit here today, with the timing of our risk retirements, the fourth quarter could actually be in sort of the high-11s going forward, that\u2019s sort of how we see it as we sit here today.","And again, as I said on an earlier comment, if we pull some of those to the left or do them or do higher adjustments than we had in our plan, obviously we could get better than that or worse than that. So repo, second part of your question, the repo activity, we did $600 million in the first quarter. We would expect to do more in the second quarter. If I was to predict, I would say it\u2019s going to be maybe not twice as much as we did in the first quarter, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we did as much as $1 billion or so in the second quarter and then I think we will trail off maybe a little bit in the third and fourth, that\u2019s as we sit here today. And a lot of that\u2019s based on sort of the cash that was available on the balance sheet in the first quarter versus what we have got after the debt issuance in February that enables us to do that, that sort of enhanced repos for the rest of the year. There are about 900,000 options that were exercised in the first quarter. We started the year with about a little more than 6 million options outstanding. As I said earlier in the prepared remarks, we were expecting options actually to have a higher level of exercising than we experienced in the first quarter. So we are watching that closely and last year, I think we did 3.7 million or 3.4 million shares, that\u2019s we are kind of expecting in our guidance right now about 3 million for the year, so that will be the toggle switch as to whether or not we do higher or lower than that.","The last thing I will say on that, on the option exercise is you asked the question about would we expect to see sort of a step function decrease. And I think the answer is yes to that. Sam as soon as the options have been exercised, there are no options replenishing those if you will, so this is a diminishing number in our dilution equation that once those 5 million options are left or exercised, they will not be replicated by a like number of options going forward. So in the way, I usually like to describe it as every single dollar of share repurchase spent once we are at that point, where we no longer have options we will have a greater chance of actually reducing the share count of the corporation.","Jerry Kircher","Karen, I think we have got time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","George Shapiro","Marillyn, I just wanted to ask your strategy in the cyber world, you obviously saw Raytheon make a big acquisition yesterday in the commercial cyber world. You are a big player in this area, if you can just kind of lay out what your strategy is?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. I will be happy to. I mean, it is an important area for us as a company. For the past 20 years consecutively, we have been the largest IT provider for the U.S. government and working for all of the cabinet agencies on a range of IT as well as cyber security. I like the portfolio that we have around cyber security. We have a multi-decade track record with encryption, with data security solutions. And we centralized all of our cyber security in the IS&GS organization. And so and our go-to-market strategy both within the U.S. government as well as commercial, that\u2019s where we are moving forward. We see incremental growth there and we rolled out and even internationally, as Bruce commented earlier, we have a cyber security intelligence center in Farnborough in the UK. We have another one in Canberra, Australia. We have our own here in the U.S. So, it is absolutely an important growth area for us. And I think what\u2019s key to us is that we have been doing cyber security long before they ever coined the term cyber security. So, it\u2019s a very important growth area for us and one that we expect to continue to excel in.","Jerry Kircher","I think that wraps it up for the time. Let me turn it over to Marillyn for final comments.","Marillyn Hewson","Well, let me just conclude today, I just want to reiterate that the corporation has had another solid quarter and it\u2019s well positioned to deliver even higher value to customers and stockholders in 2015. The ongoing execution of our employees coupled with our growing cash generation, our strong backlog of work and a solid balance sheet will continue to prevail our corporation forward in 2015 and beyond. So, thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in the next earnings call in July. Karen, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."],"13229":["Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 26, 2012  3:00 PM ET","Executives","Robert J.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher","Thank you, Jovan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Stevens","Okay, thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. All of us here hope that your new year is off to a very good start.","Let me begin with a quick summary of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we booked almost $20 billion in new business awards from domestic and international customers and finished the year with a record backlog of almost $81 billion. Strong program execution, coupled with ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, enabled segment operating margins to increase to 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% for the year, which reflected improvements over prior-year levels.","Cash generation was exceptional with $1.1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter after making accelerated pension contributions of $1 billion and over $4.2 billion for the year, surpassing the prior year by more than $450 million. We paid $325 million in dividends in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year as we continue to execute our $4 a share annual dividend payout.","Share repurchases continued in the quarter and totaled almost 32 million shares for the year, enabling the retirement of 7% of the outstanding shares. With this focus, we generated a 21% total shareholder return with 16% stock price appreciation and a 5% dividend yield. These results reflect the quality of our workforce, the dedication of our leaders and the strength of our corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company who played a role in driving these results.","Since we last spoke in October, we've seen an expansion and in some cases, an amplification of the uncertainty evident in the global security environment and in world economic conditions. The events playing out in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, North Korea, China and many other regions of the world underscore the complexity and the volatility embedded in the mission of maintaining global security. Many signs of economic stress remain, and the global recovery appears to be, at best, uneven and slow.","On the domestic horizon, we see change as well. Earlier this month, the administration released a new security strategy highlighting priorities for our 21st century defense. Citing the strategic turning point after a decade of war that is now concluding, the joint force will be reshaped to be smaller and leaner, but more agile, flexible, ready and technologically advanced. Forces are to be rebalanced with more emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East while assuring additional focus on the critical priorities of Space and cyberspace, Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance communications and navigation systems, counterterrorism and irregular warfare and effective nuclear deterrent and counter weapons of mass destruction capabilities. There will be an emphasis on air and naval forces while reducing land forces, and on building more effective security cooperation partnerships with friends and allies.","The President's 2013 budget is also set to be delivered to Congress on February 13. And Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, gave an executive summary look at the DoD portion just 1 hour ago in a press conference at the Pentagon, which actually may still be ongoing.","The Secretary described a fiscal '13 budget request of $525 billion in the base budget that compares to a $531 billion defense budget in fiscal '12, along with a request for $88.4 billion for overseas contingency operations. This new budget reflects the new security strategy and includes the effects of last year's Budget Control Act that triggered the administration's proposal to reduce the defense top line by $487 billion through 2021, with $259 billion of that reduction occurring between 2013 and 2017. This significant and substantial $487 billion reduction, in conjunction with the new security strategy, assures that commitments to deficit and debt reduction are met while maintaining an adequate security posture necessary in the uncertain and volatile world that we see today.","While we'll gain additional details about specific program funding levels in the budget as more information becomes available, the clear contours of the new strategy align exceedingly well with our portfolio and our experience. This alignment is no accident. Even as our national focus was appropriately on ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan after having committed forces there, our assessment of the global security environment suggests that the long arc of our national strategic interest would orient toward the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. That regional security there would be influenced by China, North Korea, Iran and others who are investing heavily in advanced technologies. That these technologies would include sophisticated anti-access and area-denial capabilities, the advancement of nuclear and other weapons and the missile systems necessary for their delivery, and an increasingly elaborate series of cyber systems and methods, all of which would require a response, and further that sustained pressure in world economic conditions would continue to impose constraints on the resources available to government, leading to more cooperation on shared security objectives.","That's why we took action years ago to refine the architecture of our products to assure they would incorporate the most advanced sensor fusion and communications capabilities, such that real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information could be leveraged, and that our systems would be flexible and adaptable in meeting emerging challenges. And that's why the architecture of our business model was structured on promoting sustainable security cooperation partnerships where interoperability would support more effective coalition action and leverage the global supply chain.","While we clearly recognize there would be challenges with this strategic approach, requiring us initially to deal with additional measure of innovation and the complexity that results from that innovation, our strategy is proving to be durable and well aligned. The result is a robust and increasingly mature portfolio of relevant global systems that are meeting the needs of our customers in addressing global challenges, systems like the Joint Strike Fighter, supporting 3 U.S. services, 8 initial partners and the needs of an increasing number of international customers, most recently Japan; or our missile defense capabilities, including Egypt's PAC-3 and THAAD, which are setting the standard for U.S. and allied defenses as reflected in the recent selection of THAAD by the United Arab Emirates; or the Littoral Combat Ship that is driving innovation and adaptability to a more affordable solution to meet the expanding array of demands clearly present in the littoral waters around the globe; or our space-based assets, including Advanced EHF, MUOS, SBIRS, GPS III and other satellite systems that enable unparalleled situational awareness, secure communications, precision navigation and prompt global response.","We're continuing today to apply the very same energy, rigor, talent and resources to further integrate systems at [ph] a more effective command and control, constructing more resilient networks and preparing the information technology environment for the hazards of expanding cyber threats while driving greater levels of efficiency and affordability across our company. There is much more work yet to do, which is why we are greatly distressed by the prospect of sequestration. That element of existing law mandated by the failure of the Super Committee to find additional spending reductions. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts and sequestration would approximately double the $487 billion top line reduction already reflected in defense funding with an additional $52 billion reduction in 2013.","Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has spoken in the strongest possible terms against sequestration, which he described as having catastrophic consequences to our defense. We support this view completely. The sequestration process has occurred independent of any correlation with strategy, core [ph] structure, technology needs or operational reality. While the precise detailing of the adverse impacts of sequestration are yet to be determined, the United States would likely have the smallest ground force since 1940, the fewest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest Air Force in our nation's history.","The impact on industry would be devastating. With a significant disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facility closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations, erode engineering expertise and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, directly undermining a key provision of the new security strategy, which is to preserve the industrial base.","We understand well the fiscal pressures our nation faces and have not hesitated in realigning the cost bases in our business through expense reductions, rebalancing the workforce, consolidating facilities and the like, and we'll continue to do so. And we recognize that the Department of Defense is committed to $0.5 trillion reduction over the next 10 years, an ambitious initiative that we fully support. But our position on sequestration is very clear. We must not let an automatic budget trigger, a default position in effect only due to a committee failure, to become the dominant force for allocating resources and shaping our nation's security posture, and we strongly urge action to stop this process.","Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our performance, I want to highlight an organizational change we announced this morning. After 37 years of distinguished service, Ralph Heath advised of his plans to retire from our company. I have worked with Ralph for a very long time now, and found him to be an exceptional executive in every respect. He's been dedicated and professional in every assignment, and he's set the standard for ethics and business conduct.","Ralph's decision highlights why we've invested so much time and energy in our talent management, our leadership development and our succession planning process over the years, subjects we really don't talk a lot about on this call, but subjects vitally important to our future success. Through this process, we now have an outstanding cadre of highly qualified executives ready to assume additional responsibilities and take our business forward.","Effective April 1, Larry Lawson will serve as Executive Vice President of our Aeronautics business replacing Ralph, and the business could not be in better hands. Larry brings a proven track record of success in all that he has done.","Orlando Carvalho will succeed Larry as Vice President, General Manager of the F-35 program. You may recall that Orlando jointed Aeronautics in August of 2011 after serving as President of our Maritime Systems & Sensors business. Orlando's 30 years of experience in complex systems and in organizational leadership equip him well for the demands of the F-35.  Lorraine Martin will serve as Orlando's deputy on the F-35 program, moving from the C-130, and George Shultz will assume responsibilities for C-130 operations. I mention these names because they represent the breadth and depth of talent in this company. Each has decades of experience, worked in diversified assignments, driven higher levels of performance and have built superb teams. When I tell you that it's a privilege for me to work in this company, I'm talking about the opportunity to work with leaders like Ralph, Larry, Orlando, Lorraine and George, and I thank them all.","So I have Bruce now go through some of the details of our performance, and then we'll open up the lines for questions. Bruce?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included today.","Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the full year for 2011. We grew sales for the company by 2% over our 2010 level and given the environment we operated in throughout the year, we're pleased with those results. We're even more pleased with the record backlog amount for the full year driven by almost $20 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, as Bob said.","Segment margins were 40 basis points higher than last year, reflecting a strong performance year for us with much of that improvement stemming from cost-reduction actions that we took earlier this year -- or last year, excuse me. Our earnings per share from continuing operation were 11% higher than 2010, and we generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations while accelerating $1 billion in pension contributions previously planned for 2012. So overall, 2011 was a very strong execution year, and our results reflect that performance.","On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. Two of the 4 business areas grew sales for the year led by a strong 10% increase in Aeronautics sales over 2010 levels. Electronic Systems had 2% growth for the year, better than what we premised when the year began. As anticipated, IS&GS declined by 5%, driven mostly by the absence of the U.S. Census activity this year. And Space ended the year relatively flat compared with 2010 as we expected.","Turning to Chart 5, and our backlog to end the year, all 4 business areas grew backlog in the fourth quarter, and the company increased backlog by about $8 billion in the third -- from -- over the third quarter level. Key orders recognized in the quarter included: additional funding for the F-35 LRIP 5 contract, as well as F-16 awards from Oman and Iraq in Aeronautics; additional domestic and international PAC-3 orders; a $1 billion order to upgrade Warrior fighting vehicles in the U.K.; and our first international order for the THAAD program electronic systems; the award of the NSF Polar contract to IS&GS and the FY '12 installment of the Fleet Ballistic Missile contract in Space Systems along with an award for the initial launch of an unmanned Orion capsule in 2014.","Chart 6 highlights that we grew backlog in 2011 by over $2 billion to $80.7 billion, a record for the corporation. This is the second consecutive year we've grown our backlog, and ending backlog is about $2 billion higher than our expectations at the start of the year.","Moving to Chart 7. You can see the significant improvement in margins for both the fourth quarter and total year compared with 2010, again resulting from strong program execution and our cost reduction actions. And these cost reductions are benefiting our customers as we price new business.","On Chart 8, we'll discuss our earnings per share. Our EPS from continuing operations increased 11% to $7.85 for the year. I'll remind you that last year included charges for our VESP program and the elimination of Medicare Part D subsidies. However, when adjusting both years for the negative impacts of the FAS\/CAS adjustment, our pension adjusted earnings per share grew 21% over 2010 levels.","Turning to Chart 9. You can see the effects of our cash deployment actions returning $2.5 billion back to our shareholders through share repurchases and $1.1 billion in the form of dividends during the year. Combined, we returned 109% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2011 and returned almost $200 million more than the prior year's amount.","On Chart 10, we show the impacts of our share repurchases over time. 2011 was the second straight year that we've reduced outstanding share count by 7%, and we've reduced shares outstanding by more than 100 million shares over the last 5 years.","Chart 11 shows that our total shareholder return last year was significantly outperforming all of major benchmarks. The TSR reflects both the strong execution in the year and the cash deployment actions from the prior chart.","Beginning with Chart 12, we'll discuss our outlook for the year 2012. Our sales for the year are expected to be about 2% lower than 2011 at the midpoint of our guidance. And segment profit generally falls to sales volume with our segment margins expected to remain above 11% for the year. I'll discuss both sales and segment operating profit in greater detail in the next chart.","Moving down the chart, our FAS\/CAS adjustment has improved from the trends we gave in October, I'll also speak more about this change in a couple of charts. Our earnings per share guidance for the year is $7.70 to $7.90 per share, and as a reminder, does not include any consideration for the R&D tax credit being extended into 2012. Think of that R&D tax credit being worth about $0.10 per share of benefit in 2011.","Finally, our cash from operations guidance is $3.8 billion, up slightly from what we described last quarter. I should point out that we expect the phasing our cash from operations this year to be different from prior years, and that our cash will be significantly higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. We'll be making the planned pension contributions in the first half with around $500 million in the first quarter and the remainder in the second quarter. And we also have a tax payment in the first quarter, while we had a tax refund in the first quarter of 2011. ","Chart 13 provides our guidance ranges for both sales and segment operating profit by the 4 business areas. For sales, we now expect both Electronic Systems and Aeronautics to remain relatively flat at the midpoint compared with 2011, while IS&GS and Space Systems are expected to see a reduction in sales. You'll recall that when we discussed our trend data during the third quarter call, we had expected sales to remain relatively flat compared to 2011. Two key events occurred at the end of the year that changed that outlook.","First, we were unsuccessful in our bids to win the GMD competition. This results in sales in our Space Systems segment being lower than expected when we spoke in October. Second, we've reduced our guidance for IS&GS as a result of recent customer directions to stop activities on the AMF JTRS program by the end of February. Our segment operating profit guidance is driven mostly by the sales volume. The margins for Aeronautics Space and IS&GS are expected to be down slightly, reflecting a lower dollar amount of profit rate adjustments planned for 2012 as compared to 2011, while Electronic Systems is expected to have consistent margins with what we saw in 2011.","Chart 14 shows the changes that impacted our FAS\/CAS adjustment from what we described last quarter. We ended the year with a slightly higher discount rate of 4.75% versus the 4.5% we discussed in the third quarter. And this improved the negative FAS\/CAS adjustment by $115 million. We also had other updates, which partially offset the impact of the higher discount rate by some $25 million, resulting in the 2012 FAS\/CAS adjustment of an $835 million headwind on reported earnings.","And finally, on Chart 15, we have our summary. 2011 was a strong year by any measure and reflects the focus that our team demonstrated throughout the year. 2012 is expected to be a solid year, building on the strategic alignment of our portfolio, our record backlog and the strong cash generation we've demonstrated for many years.","With that, Jovan, I think we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investment.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on the guidance and the Secretary's comments that he made this afternoon. Does your guidance reflect the things that he had to say this afternoon or is there a potential risk either to the upside or to the downside after you parse through his comments?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Jason, I'll take that one on. Obviously, we're still sorting through what the Secretary is saying. But I think in any event, I don't think there is a change to the 2012 guidance. Essentially, anything that would happen at least that I'm aware of in the conversations that he had today would affect 2013 and beyond, but we've still got some sorting out to do to see exactly what that impact would be. Bob, offer any other comments as you might want...","Robert J. Stevens","Jason, just another thought. I think the Secretary gave some executive summary views, and so we and others could get a sense of the shape and overall feel. But I think our experience has been entirely valuable to get into the details, the time phasing and other facets of the budget proper, and I don't think that's going to be available to us until February 13. So I think we'll give you -- we'll be able to give you much better insight as to our overall reaction to what is just really breaking news today when we next speak with you. But as Bruce said, it doesn't feel likely that we're overly sensitive in fiscal -- in our current fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to get an update on your views on the F-35 right now. I know when -- Bob, when you talked after Q3, there were issues when you look at LRIP 5 in terms of the structure of that program, the risks involved in potentially having to \u2013- pay for work on prior airplanes. So if you could, if you could update both on LRIP 5 where that stands today, and then also when you're looking at some of the technical challenges on the airplane such as the arresting hook, helmet-mounted display, could you give us an idea how some of that progress is going and when you expect a resolution of some of those issues?","Robert J. Stevens","Sure. I'll do my best, and you'll let us know if it's thorough enough, Doug. So when we last spoke, we had a very unique issue on LRIP 5, and it had to do with risks associated with concurrency costs. And the in -- at the time of our discussion, the formulation that we were reviewing from the government had a substantial risk transfer to industry, our company and our partners and our suppliers. Through negotiation and discussion that unfolded subsequent to the call, we negotiated the parameters associated with concurrency, and I would tell you, put it into a formulation that both we and the government felt was appropriate with regard to risk and execution, where we are accountable and they are accountable, and that's what partners do. So I think that matter is resolved. We are in the process of negotiating Lot 5 now. I don't have a time horizon where I can give you some assurance that negotiation will be complete, but we are leaning forward in an attempt to negotiate the final terms, conditions, pricing and provisions of Lot 5.","Relative to some of the technical issues that you described, Doug, and I think a number of those over time were associated with the STOVL variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, I tell you we're making progress along each of the items that are identified. I think that progress was reflected in the 2011 performance of the program overall, certainly, the flight test program that ran a little bit ahead of schedule. I think most people would have noted that the STOVL variant was removed from probation after personal involvement by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. The Secretary visited the Pax River Naval Air Station. He spoke directly with the pilots and the maintainers and others familiar with the airplane. These are folks in the government, as well as folks in industry. I believe he went through a careful and detailed review, item by item and issue by issue. I must tell you I admire very much the personal level of due diligence from a person as busy as Secretary Panetta to get personally involved to understand the details. With that understanding, he removed the jet from probation.","We know there are challenges. This is a development program. I've spoken to you as honestly and straightforwardly as I possibly can about our assessment of the development program. And I would tell you, this feels ordinary and traditional for complex airplanes of this type. It doesn't mean we're pleased when we have to modify an arresting hook or adapt a helmet-mounted display or work some thermal issues in the propulsion system. But these are observations that are the types that are relatively familiar with complex aeronautical systems like this. We've aligned our resources well. We've got great cooperation from the Naval Air Systems Command, from the Joint Program Office, from others in the government. Everyone is leaning forward. So when I tell you we had a better year on the Joint Strike Fighter, I don't mean we, Lockheed Martin. I mean, we, our partners, our suppliers, as well as all those in the government who support this effort, who understand the need. But what you will consistently hear is the underscoring of the criticality of having fifth-generation capabilities in this complex security environment. You heard that from Secretary Panetta today. You heard that from the President of the United States and Secretary Panetta when the new strategy was rolled out. We take that responsibility seriously.","We have international partners who expect us to deliver on this program, and we will. We have an increasing number of foreign military sales participants, most recently, Japan, who can look at any airplane around the globe and pick the best airplane in which they have the most confidence that will meet their security demands. They selected the F-35. That's a huge honor and responsibility for the F-35 team. And finally, Larry Lawson's leadership on this program has simply been exceptional, and he is a very seasoned and skilled executive. He's built a lot of sophisticated airplanes, including the F-22. The team that he assembled -- has assembled is first-rate and we're ready for the challenges that we face. So I will tell you the momentum is in the program. Yes, there will be some quantity reductions. We've talked to you before about the new reality. This is part of the new reality where there are complex global security challenges and scarce resources available to governments to meet those security challenges. We'll make the adaptations. We'll incorporate the new quantities once we understand their time phasing. We will drive hard to have a successful, effective, affordable program.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I wanted to ask a question on your backlog. So taking a look at your book to bill was pretty hefty, 1.6x this quarter. You finished the year greater than 1x as you said last year. Following last year's greater than 1x book to bill. Not meaning to sound like someone who's saying what have you done for me lately, just wanted to know if you could comment on the opportunity set for 2012. What's your view on 2012 book to bill? And what I'd really like to get a sense of is do you feel -- do you kind of feel that book to bill has peaked in 2011 or do you see an ability to repeat that this year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey, Rich, I'll take that one also. Hey, I was looking at this actually recently, we kind of did a review of the plan for 2012 and the outyear look as well. The thing that struck me as I was looking at that is there's not just a large number of I'll say high dollar awards in the first quarter or practically for that matter, in the first half of 2012. So what I think we're going to see, at least in the first half of the year, is some reduction in that backlog. So our book to bill will be lower than 1.0. I'm trying to think off the top of my head some of the larger orders we have in the first quarter, but things like the fiscal year '12 F-22 sustainment contract as one example. The authorization under a UCA in all likelihood of the F-35, LRIP 6 contract, and some international sales within Aero, perhaps for some C-130s might be highest dollar items in the first half of the year. I think we will likely have greater than 1 point. At least as we sit here today we'll likely have greater than 1.0 book to bill in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, a little bit different maybe than years past, which has always historically been our lowest quarter of the year from an orders perspective, and we've always dropped backlog more in the third quarter than any other quarter. I think that might change somewhat at least as we see here today that the third quarter will actually see some backlog growth. And I'm hoping, Rich, that by the end of the year, I think we might see some slight reduction. But I'd like to think we can be around the $80 billion mark for the year. And I don't think that's -- I guess that's a stretch goal I'd like to have for ourselves to kind of keep the backlog starting in the 80s. That's not a slam dunk by any stretch, but that's, again as we sit here today, that's the way I think about it, Rich.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bob, 2 questions for you. One simple and the other more big picture. First, when do you get to rate on the F-35? And the second question is can you talk about the state of IR&D? The DoD doesn't seem to be clear about where their R&D priorities are going to be beyond bomber? So where does your IR&D future look like since DoD may be a less reliable source of R&D going forward?","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, thanks, Heidi. On both of these fronts, the answer has gone a little -- it would be a little bit, we're going to have to wait and see. For example, rate on the F-35 is going to be function of we think of new quantity adjustments that will phase out. I'll give you our best understanding today. Phase out of the nearer-term lots, some of the build cycle probably more or less leveling the quantities at around 30. Again, we'll look for the detail, and then accelerating out of there. I think in conjunction with that, Heidi, our understanding today is that the total quantity to be procured domestically remains at 2,443. So we're looking at a phasing, the phasing will have dual advantages of lowering the budget demands, aligning to fiscal pressures, as well as creating some time for the maturation of the airplane that might minimize some of the revisions to the configuration. Both of those things we think makes sense. I think the other aspect of rate or volume at least in the near term, we will, in the very short term, get some clarity and insight as to the U.S. government's buy plan. And we'd like to anchor that as a foundation. And then revisit with each of our international partners and each of our potential foreign military sales customers not just those who are already on board the program like Israel or Japan, but maybe future purchasers like South Korea where there is a tender and others, and begin to then build this revised acceleration plan that will lead to rate so that we can do that in the most efficient and effective way possible. So I think that's about the best summary of F-35 volume over time to rate that we have today. And we'll get you some more details when they're available to us.","We continue to make investments internally in the areas that we think will be most relevant to the forces described in the strategy that was released. And I'll say it to you again, I think that our portfolio as defined in products and services, but also our portfolio of research and investigative initiatives aligns pretty well with the strategy that was described to the extent that we have those broad contours. For example, a number of years ago, we established, through this research and development facility, a cyber laboratory so that we could begin to much more thoroughly exercise the resilience in systems and the resilience in networks. So I think some of our actions there have aligned very well. I think the future of the overall portfolio and I very much resonate to the spirit of your question in an era of more fiscal austerity. How will the apportionment of the top line budget reduction flow between and among expense accounts like operations and maintenance and personnel and the investment accounts of procurement and research and development? And how will resources available for research be thrifted? So that's sort of an open watch item for us because we don't want to see an attrition in our engineering facility. We don't want to lose some of the innovative expertise that is fueled by access to this type of funding. And here again, I think the best we can do is look for the details over time, but we're not in possession of today and maybe, be sure to follow on with you in that regard.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So on the F-35, looking through your commentary, it looks like revenues last year were down about -- were up about $700 million on both parts of the program, and profits may be off $35 million, so the margin's off may be 1 point. Could you give us any sense now that you seem to have the concurrency issues resolved? Do we have any opportunity on margins this year -- or excuse me, moving into the future?","Bruce L. Tanner","Hey, Cai, it's Bruce. I'll take that one on. Look, without commenting on your math, your math is usually pretty accurate. But without commenting on it, the way I'd look at 2012, let's start with the revenue on the F-35 program. I think the F-35 LRIP contracts are growing somewhere in the 9-ish to 10% range year-over-year. So we're still seeing some good growth there. That's being offset because the development contract, the SDD contract, is going down compared to 2011 as you might expect. I think net-net, the F-35 is up some mid-single digits growth year-over-year. As to your question on margins, I would expect us to see some margin improvement on the F-35 in 2012, primarily because if you just sit back and think about what we're going to accomplish in the year, we're going to deliver a lot more aircraft this year. We're going to deliver, and I'm quoting this from memory here. We're going to deliver all the LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 aircraft and a good portion of the LRIP 4 aircraft all in 2012. And so as you might expect, we have a historical practice of not booking from a booking rate perspective at the at-completion position or as we expect the programs to run at their end or at their completion until we've retired the risk on those contracts. And so as you might expect, we've got some risk retirement that we're expecting to become finalized with the final delivery of those aircraft. And again, because a good chunk of those 3 LRIPs are all finishing in 2012, we would expect to see some margin improvement compared to 2011 for the F-35.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee & Leach.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a question on capital deployment. You guys have been setting the standard amongst your peers in terms of dividends and buybacks. I wanted -- how are you approaching it going forward now that we kind of have pretty good feel directionally, where the budgets are going to be and potentially a lot of moving parts amongst your peers when you weigh that against a selective M&A? How are you looking at that in terms of going forward on the strategy?","Robert J. Stevens","Well, with -- in today's environment, we're looking at cash deployment pretty much the same the way we have been, and we're not communicating with you any change in strategy or philosophy because I think you know that the first thing we do is start by getting the cash. And I don't say that lightly, but we have a very rigorous focused and disciplined process here that is institutionalized around the company that cash management matters a great deal relative to our ability to both make appropriate internal investments and then return appropriate value to shareholders. So we're rigorously focused on that, and we like the balanced cash deployment approach we have that you highlighted, a component for share repurchases and a component for dividends. We spent a lot of time talking with the investors in the company to make sure that we understand your sense about how we ought to be thinking about cash deployment, but I don't think you should expect a change in our approach.","Bruce L. Tanner","Peter, this is Bruce. I don't think I said in my remarks, but I'll say it here because it relates to your question, obviously. The guidance that we provided for 2012 assumes that we're going to have at least $1 billion of share repurchases contained within the earnings per share number that we gave you. And I think that's the at least some indication that we're going to continue the practices that we've done and demonstrated in the last few years.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just for Bruce, a quick clarification on your comments around the Aeronautics margin and then a question about long-term pension funding. On the margin, back to what you were talking about on the F-35 and your sort of historical behavior pattern on EACs and risk retirement around the end of a contract, as you look to the end of the F-22, should we be expecting anything that kind of intra-year quarterly patterns of margin in Aeronautics that's worth noting in 1 quarter versus some of the others? And then secondly, you provided some commentary around pension funding. Obviously, that's in the guidance in 2012. I just wondered if you might give us some color on how that stands where we are today for 2013 and beyond.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes. Thanks Carter. So let's say, I'll start with the sort of the F-22 question, would you see the same thing that we described. I think that was your question as we saw or as I commented on the F-35. I think there's 8 aircraft left to deliver on the F-22 production program. All of them have literally left the factory, and they're sitting in what we call our flight line operations going through, as you might expect, flight testing both with our pilots and with the government pilots. So there's not a lot of -- frankly, there's not a lot of cost left to do on those aircraft. Again, they are all built, at this point in time, they were finished last year. So most of the risk retirement that you would associate with the end of the program occurred in the 2011 time frame, not the 2012 time frame. So while there might be some opportunities for improvement, I wouldn't expect it to be as substantial, for instance, as we saw in 2011.","Longer-term pension funding, again, we accelerated $1 billion of the required payments from 2012 into 2011. As we look for and I think you're probably aware of the CAS Harmonization rules were recently passed or implemented. I think they're actually effective not until next month, but I think the notification came out at the end of December of last year. We should see cash recovery rise in the next few years, but the actual payments from the ERISA perspective looking into from 2012 into 2013, I think we're paying now about $1.1 billion in 2012. That number grows to about $2.1 billion in 2013. The flip side of that is the CAS recoveries about $1.1 billion. So think of that as being sort of a breakeven position. CAS risk -- excuse me, risk of payments out and CAS recoveries in for 2012. The CAS recovery in '13 is more like $1.4 billion. So we're getting some of the benefit of the CAS Harmonization, but not much. ERISA payments are probably at similar level in the year after and the CAS recovery grows some beyond that. So slow recovery I'll say it back to -- sort of getting back to a breakeven position, primarily because the CAS Harmonization got pushed out further than we had expected when we started first talking about CAS Harmonization. That's still expecting in the not-too-distant future for that to get close to breakeven, then start to flip the other way around where we're getting more collections than payouts.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Joe Nadol with JPMorgan Securities.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bob, on the capital deployment front, you have made maybe a subtle shift in the strategy or maybe it's just the timing, but you've done a couple of acquisitions here in the fourth quarter that were -- they weren't huge, but they were bigger than certainly than you've been doing. You've also over the last year or so divested a couple of the deals that you had done a few years ago. And I think all 4 of these acquisitions, I'm including the -- or all 4 of these deals, I'm talking about the 2 acquisitions you made in the fourth quarter as well as Savi and PAE, they're in adjacencies. So I was wondering if you could maybe characterize big picture how you're viewing acquisitions in adjacencies? And then maybe a little bit on each of the deals and why you decided to divest Savi and then acquire these other 2?","Robert J. Stevens","Sure, I'll be happy to, Joe. I think that we are -- you mentioned timing here. I think that's maybe a little bit of timing. We've had a-string-of-pearls approach. We like that approach. We look for companies that give us access to markets, unique technology, they provide a good fit, they have some ease of integration and they meet our overall test for valuations. I think the acquisitions you're referring to were Sim-Industries and QTC. They are part of an adjacent market strategy that we've had in place for a number of years now. We are certainly interested in moving this business forward in the technology areas that we think customers will increasingly value and in areas where we can back up some synergies. If you think of Sim-Industries in the market for simulators, we've been in the simulator business for a long time. This extends our portfolio. We're not unwilling to take that portfolio beyond our traditional customer sets to bring in some of those business practices into our core business. We think there is real synergy there. We'll continue to explore for businesses that fit our portfolio, fit our business model and that will now align with the contours of this new National Security Strategy and the portfolio we've put in place. So to the extent that there would be a business that would provide for us international opportunities, we will certainly look at that. With regard to the cyber domain, I think there'll be a continuing and even growing demand for capabilities in that regard. Our Systems Integration businesses is always one that we'd like to reinforce and support. And certainly the emerging field of energy and here, we're going to be selective because one size isn't going to fit all. But we do have some interest in the energy domain as well as others. I think there'll be some opportunities unfolding as we see the details in the budget domestically and maybe get a better feel for how our global customers respond, perhaps, in logistics and sustainability and support. If long-term budgets are going to be under pressure, yet operational tempos are going to remain high. If we're going to have deployments to Asia-Pacific, in the Middle East, if we're going to find innovative ways to move forces around, we think there'll be roles in our logistics business, in our support and our supply businesses there. So if there were acquisition opportunities there, we would look. We've been prudent, I think, as good stewards of the hard-earned cash position that we have. We want to maintain good credit quality. We have firepower, that financial flexibility, I think, is a discriminator of our company along with our portfolio and our selectivity about what we buy and what we do with it.","In the case of the divestitures, if there are changes in the market, changes in the customers' behavior, we are not going to keep businesses that don't align with the overall strategic arc and trajectory of this businesses, and we'll be decisive. So I think on the acquisition side we want to be selective so that we're not talking to you in the future about a lot of divestitures. But in a case where circumstances change, we're going to face the reality, deal with those changes and move the business forward. In doing so, we'll try to generate as much value as we can and share that value with investors to the best of our ability.","Operator","And next on the line, we have George Shapiro with Access 3:42.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","This is for Bruce. If you take a look at Aeronautics, you disclosed this quarter that you had risk retirement of $70 million on the F-16, and another $35 million on the C-130 and C-5, and together, it's maybe 270 basis points addition to the margin. Can you just describe what they were actually related to and what the opportunity is for getting more of those next year? And is there any way we can kind of anticipate some of those coming? And then one other one in that area. The F-35 profit margin is clearly implied to be down in this quarter based on your commentary. I just want to validate that, that's probably LRIP 4 being booked in higher revenues and a lower margin that's kind of swamping your overall numbers, and there wasn't any change in any of the other program margins.","Bruce L. Tanner","Okay, let me start, George, with the first question, the F-16 step-ups and the C-130 what drove them and what's out there for next year and what should you be looking for. The F-16 we've -- I'll say a lot of that was sort of ordinary run-of-the-mill program execution, clicking off performance milestones and retiring risk accordingly. There was on one of our international contracts, a particular item that we were tracking towards that we actually reached closure on in the fourth quarter that we felt justified a step up. So that particular item, which was -- I'm trying to think off the top of my head, George, that was a pretty good chunk, probably 1\/2 or so of the F-16 pick-up, that will likely not repeat next year on the F-16 program. The C-130 program is again just sort of the clicking off the normal manufacturing activities. The only thing that was a little bit unusual on the C-130 is we had a really, really good performance on the sustainment contracts on the C-130 activities in the quarter. And I'd like to think that we have the opportunity to do that in 2012 as well. We're -- I think we've really hit a stride where customers are seeing great value in the sustainment support that we are providing those, particularly obviously, the international customers is where that -- most of that happens. And I'd like to think that, that was -- be something that you'll continue to see in 2012 as well.","As far as the F-35 profit margins are concerned, I mean, there was no -- and I'm doing this again from the top of my head, that there was no profit adjustments upwardly or downwardly in the quarter. So any margin change that happened was purely volume related. We are starting to get some heavier activity in the LRIP 4 contract as you described in your question. And that's again because as I said earlier LRIP 2, 3 and part of 4 will start delivering this year. So that volume is starting to come in, and some of that margin improvement that we're looking for in 2012 will be on contracts such as LRIP 4 as we start to see production aircraft roll-off the line as we anticipate. That will be the triggering mechanism, if you will, for the risk retirements that we plan.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just going back to the cash flow outlook for next year at $2.8 billion on the op cash line. Bruce, a couple of things. One, the pension expense after-tax looks like it's a $750 million tailwind or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And then is there anything outside of maybe advances or cash taxes, are those the 2 major downers to the cash in 2012? It just seems like even your usual 10%, 15% conservatism, this would be a bit lighter than you might otherwise have given the tailwind on lower pension contributions?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, hey Myles, let me -- just to clarify what I think I heard. I think you said $2.8 billion in operating cash in 2012, it's $3.8 billion for the year. And if your questions, again, when there was -- again there were a lot of receipts that got pulled into 2011 from 2012, including some fairly good-sized international receipts. And that's one of the things that enabled us to do the $1 billion acceleration of the pension plan. So we're actually ahead of the game. In fact, for the first time in the corporation's history, at least as I look back in the records, we actually have negative working capital at the working -- at the corporation level. So that's hard to replicate, and one of the reasons that you'll see are -- that your calculation from balance sheet perspective, that's the heart of your question. It's because you're seeing some of the work-off, if you will, that negative working capital coming back next year. I'd like to think even having said that, there are still opportunities. I can tell you, if you talk to any of my folks in the finance organization working in the 4 business areas, they will tell you that I am pushing hard to do better on cash flow than what we've committed to here. And I think there are opportunities to do that, but we're just not there at this point in time to change the guidance accordingly. We'll, obviously, give you updates throughout the year as we progress, and we'll come back to you and tell you how we're doing on that challenge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Bob, you were very successful in placing THAAD in UAE. Are there a couple more opportunities for this? And might you also address some international potential?","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, thanks, Howard. I'll tell you that relative to the THAAD in the UAE program, you know that Chris Kubasik hadn't been on the calls because he went out and got a real job as our Chief Operating Officer. And he'd been doing an excellent job in focusing on the execution of programs like THAAD, as well as assuring that we're listening carefully to the needs of customers. When we look at the Middle East and you start with an assessment of the security climate there, I think many people look at the Iranians with respect to their actions and their intentions even in the most recent discussions about prospect of closing the Straits of Hormuz, and it creates a very high level of tension. And people recognize that they have invested in the kind of technologies that include ballistic missile threats, and therefore, many in the region who have population centers, who have oil production centers, who have strategic areas of interest view missile defense as a very critical system. So that as we look at the National Security Strategy that was outlined by the President -- the Secretary when they talked about increasing security cooperation partnerships movement as you highlighted by United Arab Emirates here with THAAD, I think if you look across the -- generally, the Gulf Coordinating Council regions, you would see I think a similar level of threat and risk and a similar desire on the part of our administration to lean forward. Now you know we follow a very discreet process here that starts with government-to-government discussions. First, and nothing that we would say or do would subvert that process. But in the longer term, I suspect there'll be heightened and continued interest. I think that those interests will be viewed favorably by our government, and I think we'll have a maturing portfolio in the Middle East with regard to missile defense. I think there'll be a similar version of that experience throughout the Asia-Pacific theater, because we're watching the same or similar type of overall security risk, the proliferation of technologies, the desire to get missiles of greater performance, longer range, more precision, and the desire for governments to have some protection against that ballistic missile threat. So I think this segment of our portfolio is one that will likely grow internationally. Our focus is on making sure that we're executing the requirements under the contract that the technology stays robust. And there was a question earlier about research and development or how are you investing, well, we want to make sure that we have resources available to think in terms of next-generation technology and how can we adapt, how can we provide adjuncts to this system. Maybe it's greater range, maybe it's greater payload. But to continue to evolve these systems, and we think that's a very smart way to address the demands in the global security environment. Of course, you need a mature portfolio to start with before you can evolve that portfolio as the dynamics in the global security environment unfold themselves and we can address them. And I'm very pleased that we have the kind of portfolio you mentioned that we have it in Aegis, we have it in PAC-3. In our missile defense portfolio that forms a really good basis where some incremental investment could not only satisfy customer needs today, but satisfy them tomorrow and can enable us to adapt the system for regional demands around the globe.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS Securities.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of little things. Bruce, I don't think you specifically said the tax rate you're looking for, for 2012. And then back on F-35 in terms of the mix, could you maybe breakout percentage-wise on the production side how much of the revenue base you think in 2012 will be LRIP 2 aircraft versus 3 versus 4?","Bruce L. Tanner","I'll answer the easy one first, David. Tax rate for 2012 is -- right now, we're looking at about 30%. That excludes, obviously, the effects of the R&D tax credit. But for planning purposes, think about 30%. Relative to your question on the split of the LRIPs, I'll remind you this is a contract that we\u2019re -- the LRIP contracts themselves are contracts that were booking on a percentage-of-completion basis. So there's very little cost, I'll say, for the LRIP 2 aircraft relative to -- it is not proportional to taking simply LRIP 2 aircraft divide it by the total, because those -- the cost to build those aircraft similar to what I was describing on the F-22 program are kind of behind us. They're out of the factory. They're going through flight testing and the like, and so it's difficult to parse that out. Off the top of my head, I'll say for the total LRIP activity, that's heavily, heavily dominated by LRIP 3 and LRIP 4 activity, which you would probably expect in 2011, and that will shift over in 2012 to the LRIP 4 and LRIP 5 and a similar pattern all the way through future years.","Robert J. Stevens","Jovan, let me say thank you for your help today. We're going to take our increasingly mature portfolio of relevant global systems, focus on the needs of our customers in addressing global challenges, and we look forward to updating you with our progress next quarter.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thank you, Karen, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us to review our first quarter results.","As today's release detailed, we had a solid quarter operationally and financially with strong top-line growth and outstanding cash generation. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our team for their continuing efforts, as we focus the corporation on growth, successfully delivering solutions to customers and value to stockholders.","While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later, I wanted to touch on several highlights for this quarter. First, our operating profit and earnings per share were negatively impacted by two earnings adjustments that I will comment on in a minute. Our EPS of $2.61 equaled that of last year; however, our EPS would have been $3 per share without these adjustments. Second, our cash from operations was strong in the quarter and we increased our outlook for the year. And lastly, we returned over $1 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.","I'd like to take a moment to comment on the two earnings adjustments that occurred this quarter, which caused an unanticipated negative impact to operating profit and EPS. The first was a charge associated with an international C4I contract to produce the world's first end-to-end integrated air and missile defense system. Our solution to date has proven to be less mature than needed for this highly complex effort and we are working with the customer to fulfill their requirements. We do believe, however, that once completed, this system has the potential to bring these uniquely integrated capabilities to other customers around the world.","The second item is a non-cash impairment charge related to an international joint venture in which we participate. During the first quarter, the venture in which we own a minority interest, determined that reduced business prospects required it to impair certain assets. As a consequence, we recorded our proportionate share and this resulted in the other charge you saw in our earnings release today.","Finally, I am pleased to report that during the first quarter, we were able to arrive at an overall economic agreement for F-35 LRIPs 9 through 11, that allowed us to accept the unilateral pricing for LRIP 9, complete negotiations for LRIP 10 and establish cash payment terms for all three lots that were improvements over previous positions. It was the overall bundling of economic considerations and resulting improved cash terms that enabled us to increase our cash outlook for the year that you saw in our earnings release.","We will continue our strong emphasis on growth, cash generation and shareholder-friendly actions as our business areas continue to provide products and services that are in great demand by our customers.","Before discussing operational highlights from our business areas this quarter, I'd like to outline the status of DOD budgets. At this time, government spending remains limited by the continuing resolution that is set to expire on April 28. As you know, the continuing resolution, or CR, limits funding to prior year's levels and prohibits new programs from starting.","Discussions are underway to extend the CR as Congress continues to debate the regular appropriations bills. We are hopeful that these discussions result in an approved FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Act as we feel a further lack of budget clarity could have longer-term consequences for our armed forces and our industry. And we continue to urge our country's leadership to reach an agreement.","There are however, several encouraging indications that our nation's leaders are aligned with the need for a focus on defense spending. First, the House recently passed the FY 2017 appropriations bill, and it is currently residing with the Senate. This bill, which is in compliance with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, also supports vital equipment procurement, with increased spending called out for BLACK HAWK helicopters, as well as additional F-35s. Similarly, we are pleased to see President Trump's 2017 supplemental defense appropriations submission and the administration's initial FY 2018 budget outline, or skinny budget; both request funds in excess of the Budget Control Act caps.","Last month, I attended the Munich Security Conference, where well-respected leaders from the U.S. and participating countries echoed the theme that the international security environment has become increasingly more volatile. Recent events around the world have only served to confirm this sentiment. We, as a nation, need to recognize these threats and provide our military leaders relief from current budgetary constraints and allow them to address the challenges they face in defense of our country and our citizens. We remain hopeful that progress will continue to be made in this area, and upcoming legislation will include the increases necessary to continue to equip and maintain our fighting forces.","Moving to operations, the quarter contained multiple mission success events, and I'd like to feature one each from our Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, and Rotary and Mission Systems business areas. As some of you may know, this past February, the U.S. Air Force held their premier air combat exercise, Red Flag, at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, Nevada.","This year's training event featured, for the first time, the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL, variant, which was placed into service following its successful initial operating capability declaration in August of 2016.","After flying over 207 sorties, the fleet of 13 F-35A jets posted an impressive success rate of 20 to 1 against the highest level threats known in the simulated contested environment. Just as importantly, the aircraft's stealth capability and electronic warfare suite allowed it to eliminate ground-based surface-to-air missile installations, effectively securing the battle space and providing unparalleled situational awareness.","In addition, the F-35 flew alongside the F-22 Raptor and joint and coalition forces, including participants from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's RAF, demonstrating the important interoperability this generation platform provides.","Lastly, and just as significantly, the CTOL jet excelled in the maintenance aspect of the exercise. The F-35 and its Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, proved to be a highly reliable weapon system, achieving a mission capable rate well above 90%, and far surpassing legacy aircraft averages of 70% to 85% availability during the high ops tempo environment of Red Flag, a design quality that has been recognized by users as a true differentiator of this product. We believe the success of this event continues to highlight the unprecedented abilities of the F-35, and we are proud to produce the most capable and reliable aircraft in the world.","Turning to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, I'd like to highlight a noteworthy milestone that occurred this quarter. Last month, we were honored to have our long range anti-ship missile, or LRASM, selected as the Aviation Week Laureate Award winner in the Defense category for its technical achievements in meeting an urgent operational need of our warfighters. LRASM is a precision-guided, anti-ship standoff missile based on the Extended Range version of our Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM-ER variant. LRASM is currently being developed and integrated for operational capability on Navy and Air Force platforms.","Also, in collaboration with our Rotary and Mission Systems business area and their vertical launch system technology, our Missiles and Fire Control team initiated development with our own investment funding of an innovative surface launch solution that can be deployed from ships at sea, providing the U.S. Navy with new anti-surface warfare capability as part of their distributed lethality concept. We were pleased with this award recognition and with our ability to continue to bring our company's capabilities and collaboration to bear for our customers and warfighters.","Finally, just a few weeks ago, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, received an affirmative Milestone C decision from the Defense Acquisition Board and will now enter the low rate initial production phase of the program. This Milestone C decision comes less than 18 months after the CH-53K made its first flight, a remarkable accomplishment for this aircraft, with its unmatched payload capability and modern avionics.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our first quarter financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We had mixed results as we begin 2017. As expected, we had strong sales growth across the portfolio, along with outstanding cash generation in the quarter, and we continue to implement the cash deployment actions that our stockholders are used to seeing.","On the other hand, our operating profit in the quarter was impacted by two negative events that detracted from what otherwise would have been a strong earnings quarter. Based on these results, we've updated our outlook for the year to reflect higher sales and cash from operations, and slightly lower segment operating profit and earnings per share. We'll elaborate on all of these items as we progress through the next few charts.","On chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about 7% higher this quarter, compared with last year, with each of the four business areas showing growth over last year's results. Aeronautics and Space Systems led the growth, with Aeronautics driven by F-35 production and sustainment, which more than offset one fewer aircraft delivery in the quarter for the both C-130 and C-5 programs.","Space Systems growth was driven by the inclusion of AWE sales this quarter, compared with none in the first quarter of last year. Both Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control grew at low single-digit rates in the quarter.","Earnings per share of $2.61 was consistent with our results from a year ago, but this quarter's results included $0.39 of charges associated with our revised estimate to complete the C4I contract and the joint venture impairment. These two items offset strong performance by Space Systems in the quarter, along with higher earnings in Aeronautics due to the continued increase in F-35 activity.","Turning to chart 5, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditure level from the $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was $1.5 billion. We've returned just over $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter or 70% of our free cash flow. And this was fairly evenly split between share repurchases and dividends. So we're right on track for the full year cash deployment goals we discussed last quarter.","On chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2017. We're increasing our sales outlook by $100 million based on higher expectations for Space Systems for the rest of this year. Our segment operating profit outlook has several moving pieces that net to a $30 million reduction from our previous guidance.","We are lowering our RMS's outlook by $90 million, with a $120 million C4I charge, partially offset by $30 million of improved performance in other parts of the portfolio. We're increasing our outlook for Aeronautics by $35 million and Space Systems by $25 million for the year with the Aeronautics increase driven by performance improvements in a number of programs and the Space Systems increase driven mostly by higher expected equity earnings from ULA.","Our other unallocated expense increased by $50 million, mostly driven by the joint venture impairment we discussed. We'll show how all these changes impacted our earnings per share outlook on the next chart and finally, we are increasing our cash from operations by $300 million to now be greater than or equal to $6 billion.","Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. As we've already discussed, the C4I charge and the JV impairment are $0.25 and $0.14 negative impacts to our January EPS outlook range of $12.25 to $12.55. Combined, the increased outlooks from Aeronautics and Space Systems, along with the partial offset within RMS add $90 million to our segment operating profit outlook or about $0.20 to our previous EPS guidance. And a lower tax expense forecast, along with several other minor improvements in our expense outlook, adds another $0.09 to our prior outlook. Netting all of these items results in a reduction of $0.10 in our EPS outlook or a new guidance range of $12.15 to $12.45.","On chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for Space Systems for the rest of the year. We're maintaining the sales ranges for the other three business areas at this time.","Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We decreased our operating profit outlook in total by $30 million. RMS is down $90 million for the C4I contract charge, net of other improvements. Aeronautics is $35 million higher and Space Systems is higher by $25 million.","And finally, on chart 10, we have our summary. Our first quarter performance was mixed with a couple of earnings charges detracting from strong performance elsewhere in the business. Our cash performance was strong in the quarter and we expect that performance to carry over to a higher full year outlook than we provided last quarter. We continue to provide significant cash returns to our stockholders and we're not giving up on trying to overcome our early setbacks and making 2017 a year we can be proud of.","With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions. And our first question for today comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein Research.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On F-35, two things. If you look at the situation, if we should end up in a continuing resolution, could you talk a little bit about what that might mean for F-35? And then, also you've talked about getting the CTOL version, the price down to about, maybe, under $80 million by 2021. Can you talk about what that means for the margin trajectory for the program?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So, Doug, just on a continuing resolution, we wouldn't expect any impact on F-35. That, as you know, is a long-cycled business. The contracts that we're performing on were some time ago. So with \u2013 the CR effects are not being able to add new contracts at this point. So the program that we're producing on today is not impacted by the CR. I'll let Bruce pick up the question on margins.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah. I don't think I've got a whole lot off from the CR issue, Doug, other than \u2013 as you well know the F-35, I mean the work that we're performing today was from several fiscal years ago. It takes about three years or so to go through the F-35 lifecycle from sort of the initial dollar award to the first aircraft delivery. So, as Marillyn said, I wouldn't expect to see, especially in 2017, much of an impact, if anything, even should CR be extended.","On the CTOL question, getting price below $80 million and its impact on margin, the only way that would impact our margin negatively, Doug, is if we price those contracts assuming that we can get there and obviously don't achieve that but that's not our expectation. Our expectation is that we'll bring \u2013 be able to bring the cost down to support that price with both the U.S. government customer as well as our international customers and make the profit levels that we've talked about before that we should be making, when we get to kind of full rate production on this contract around this program. So, I would say, arguably no impact unless we have performance that we're not expecting to have in that timeframe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, Bruce, just a follow-up on that F-35. The sales increase seeing a little low to me, given I thought we're going to get up about $2.5 billion for the year, if you just comment on that. And then in return for getting better cash terms on the program, did you give up anything in potential margin, or if not, what did you give up? And then, incremental margin in the quarter was about 17%, would imply that there were some pickups in margin rates, if you could talk about which blocks. Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, George. Good questions. So, yeah, sales in the first quarter probably were a little lighter than we'd expected. I think it's important that we did say we're going to hold the guidance for the other business areas besides Space Systems that includes Aeronautics. We still think that the F-35 program is going to have the kind of volume growth throughout the rest of the year that we saw \u2013 that we forecasted in the guidance that we provided to you last quarter.","And just to put it in some perspective, I think I looked at the F-35 program. I think the first quarter is up like 15% over the first quarter of last year. So we're still seeing some pretty significant volume increases, even though we expect the full year to actually be higher than that. So I still think we're going to track to the outlook we provided in first quarter and I think we'll catch up between now and the end of the year to where we expected to be when we talked last quarter.","The better cash terms that we got there, you should think of that impacting the LRIP 9 contract, LRIP 10 and LRIP 11. And I think your question specifically, George, was, did we give up margins associated with that. You should think of this as sort of bundling of a lot of things that got together the \u2013 I'll say the biggest thing that \u2013 and this was in Marillyn's comments. The biggest thing that we gave up during this bundling of activities or economic opportunities was we dropped the claim on the LRIP 9 unilateral and we feel good about that. Frankly, we're glad to have that behind us. And we think that the economic benefits of what we got collectively justified dropping that claim going forward. So we're good and we're glad to get that behind us.","And then lastly, as you usually do, George, you did a good analysis on sort of the incremental margin in the quarter and it is higher. I think you said 17%, I think that's about right. Couple of things happened there and I think it's all good news as you might expect there. One of the bigger things that happened is we actually had some step ups associated with our international final assembly and checkout facilities. I think of this as both the Italian facility as well as the Japanese facility where we're doing the \u2013 as by definition, the final assembly and checkout of F-35s at those two locations.","As you might expect, we started those efforts fairly low. It's not easy to sort of establish from essentially nowhere, a program of record and the ability to deliver aircraft at an international location. So we started looking those \u2013 both those locations and the work that we're doing to support those establishments pretty conservatively. It turns out, we're doing pretty good on those contracts and we're actually delivering aircraft out of the Italian FACO and expect to soon on the Japanese FACO as well. So, because of that, we were actually able to step up from our previous conservative numbers there and we feel good about where we are as we sit here today. So, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hey, Peter.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Bruce, maybe just it's kind of a quick one on first, just clarification. What should we expect for kind of overall helicopter deliveries , Bruce, (25:40) for the year? I understand, commercial, obviously, is way down, but just kind of expectations around kind of the government deliveries. And then just also just related to, I guess, LRIP 11 was kind of key for your overall bookings guidance for the year for 2017. Are you still kind of targeting a book-to-bill of near 1 for 2017? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Peter. So, helo deliveries for the year, in total, were down in the first quarter. As you saw from the earnings release we provided, I think we're down 14 in total between our commercial and military aircraft in the first quarter. We actually expect that to pick up in the next three quarters of the year, and actually finish the year just about at the exact same spot that we ended 2016 with in terms of deliveries; you should think of that as 180-plus helos in total.","We did not deliver \u2013 I don't remember if you asked this question or not, Peter, but just to comment on it, we did not deliver any commercial helos in the first quarter. However, if you look at the outlook for the rest of the year, we do expect to deliver about the same number of commercial helos in 2017 as we did in 2016. Those helos are in the backlog as we sit here today, they're just phased differently in the year than they were last year. And then I think your \u2013 let's see, I think that just bakes into what's the \u2013 the military helicopters are the difference between the total in that 10 aircraft that I just talked about there.","And I think your last question was on the LRIP 11 and booking guidelines and our booking guidance that we provided. We still expect to see \u2013 it's probably going to come in two tranches, Peter. Second quarter, we expect to get an undefinitized contractual action, very large one, associated with LRIP 11. So that will be a pretty significant order, pretty significant increase in book-to-bill in the quarter. And then we're hoping, and I think the government is hoping as well, to finalize and definitize the LRIP 11 contract by the third quarter of this year. We'll get another little bump associated with that definitization. And we do expect, as you said in the question, we do expect to finish the year at a greater than 1:1 \u2013 or 1.0, excuse me, book-to-bill ratio.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Bruce, I'm wondering if you could just talk about, over the past five or six months, just at a very high level, on F-35, has anything changed on that program? Clearly, there's been a lot of discussion around pricing and contracting. Has anything changed on that program at all over the past few months that would kind of affect your view on margins on that program longer term?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","No, Joe, I'm trying to think. The only thing that's happened over the last six months sort of negatively on the program, we did have this tube issue, which we refer to as the PAO tube issue, that we had to essentially make some modifications into some delivered aircraft to remove that \u2013 remove and replace that tubing, as well as change the process going forward. That had a slight hit to the overall performance on the program, but other than that, there's not \u2013 I'm thinking and I'm looking at Marillyn when I'm saying this, Joe, there's nothing structural that I would point to that's different than what we've been saying for the last couple years about our ability to sort of structurally grow the program's margins as we head into full rate production. So, I think the short answer to your question is no.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","And the PAO tubes issue is behind us now. We have modified all the aircraft.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good point. PAO is \u2013 we're done. I think it was done actually at very beginning of the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a clarification on the cash, and then I wondered if you could give us just a little bit more color on the booking rate adjustments. I think you called out there were several. Did the LRIP finalization 9 through 11 have any impact, upwardly, on the multi-year cash profile that you had talked about previously ,or did it impact the phasing?","And then on the booking rates, I noticed that you were down, clearly, a C-5 delivery, and you called out the revenues, but no mention of the profits there. Was there a booking rate adjustment there? And you called out a couple of negative booking rate adjustments on various programs. I wondered if you could just give us some color on that.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Okay. Carter, I'll take a shot at those. So, I think just the overall booking rate adjustments, I think you're asking about the F-35 in particular, and we mentioned a couple. The biggest change in F-35 were for those two international...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","FACOs, yeah.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","...final assembly and checkout, yeah, final assembly and checkout facilities that I talked about before in Italy and Japan. And as I said, this is a good example where we perform \u2013 we had a couple of setbacks with some international programs. Here is some good news on the international side, where we actually did a very good job of establishing those facilities and are doing a good job at those facilities, and that resulted in the (31:28) that you saw in the first quarter.","LRIP 9 through 11, I think your question relates to the three-year $15 billion or more objective that we established our goal that we established last, I guess, it was fourth quarter or first quarter of this year. I think it gives us an opportunity, Carter. It surely gives us greater clarity, because we've got better insight into established terms and conditions for the next three significant LRIP contracts in a row. So we won't have to, if you will, haggle over terms and conditions associated with cash collections. So, I'd like to think that gave us greater clarity, and I think it gives us some potential to have some better performance, F-35 related, relative to what we had expectation wise in that $15 billion as well. So, I think there is the possibility there that you were hinting at in your question.","And then on the C-5, we did mention the profit being down, for the one aircraft being down. There was no really change in margins whatsoever, and there was \u2013 and I'll say an associated earnings reduction associated with the lower sales volume, but margin is exactly the same as it was a year ago, so no change there whatsoever.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Sikorsky and whether you expect to get to a positive contribution on the EBIT line from Sikorsky this year. And then whether next year promises to see kind of more meaningful EBIT contribution and if you could size that at all?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Seth, can you go through that one more time, I'm not sure I followed that entirely.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Yeah. On Sikorsky, I wonder if you could tell us, if you expect to get to a positive EBIT contribution from Sikorsky in 2017 and then if we should think about a much more meaningful contribution in 2018 on the EBIT line and maybe if you could size that.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah. Sorry. So, the Sikorsky, I think, we're really close, well let's back up. Sikorsky is always going to have, at least for a long period of time, the intangible amortization associated with the purchase accounting, if you will, for that acquisition. So you should think of Sikorsky getting $230 million or so a year, at least for the next few years and then I think it sort of gradually gets smaller than that. But we'll have that with us for \u2013 I think the period of amortization is something like 15 years. So, it's going to be with us a long time. That's going to be a drag there.","As we look at kind of 2017, I think Sikorsky is actually going to be a positive for us in terms of absolute EBIT dollars, even with that drag. It's going to get a little, I'll say, messier going forward, because we've actually combined some things in with Sikorsky from the heritage Lockheed Martin performance. So, for instance, several of you have been to our facilities in Owego, New York, where we do or have done historically a lot of helicopter modification programs and helicopter enhancement programs, including the U.S. Navy's Romeo and Sierra, sort of submarine hunting helicopter and the mission packages that go with that. We've combined that together with what we are now referring to as Sikorsky, at least internally. And if you add that together with the piece that came from Owego, it's a strong positive to us in the year.","But just focusing on Sikorsky going forward into 2018, we should see an uptick there, as we continue to sort of wean our way from the restructuring charges and some of the implementation cost that we have, in order to attain the savings that we expect to see. And we do expect to see those savings start to materialize in pretty good fashion starting in 2018. So that'll be our expectation.","I think more importantly, as we've talked about in the past, 2018's cash flow is where we're expecting to see some pretty good sized increases and that's predominantly because of working off a lot of the development programs and especially things like the Canadian Maritime Helicopter program, where we're actually at a loss position when we acquire that business. And as we start to get out of the CMH \u2013 or not the CHMP, the CH-53K developments and the presidential helicopters and actually started converting these into production contracts. We should start seeing much stronger cash flows starting in 2018 to accompany the increase in earnings that I just talked about.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Not sure how to pronounce this, but EDGE-T may be. Can you give us a sense of how much risk remains on that program and maybe also that the timing of some of the key risk retirement milestones?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah. Pete, I'll take a shot at that. So it's EDGE-T, I know it well. Let me just give you a little bit of background, maybe just I think it'd be helpful in not just with where we got to go in the future, but maybe how we got here. I think as I look at this, what's sort of unusual about this is this is a firm fixed priced contract that includes a pretty substantial amount of developmental work. That's not something that we generally sign up for. I mean, typically in a perfect world, we'd like to deliver sort of products off our production lines internationally.","On this one, we actually chose to do some development and almost by definition, when you do that at an international environment, you're going to do it on a fixed price basis. Frankly, that's one of the reasons why we like to do most of the development with U.S. government under a cost-reimbursable type contract as opposed to development contract \u2013 as opposed to fixed price, excuse me.","We knew, going in, this would be a challenge to perform this work, but we had developed capabilities under our own IRAD dollars that we thought would make this essentially an off-the-shelf solution and we sort of priced it accordingly. And as it turns out, as we got into the implementation of this, the solution ended up being far less robust than what was needed. And I'll say the implementation environment was more complex than we expected.","And there was also some evolving customer requirements and sort of some give and take that occurred, the longer the implementation took to deploy. So, all of those things led us to where we are today. Where we sit today, we think we have this sized appropriately. The milestones that you talked about going forward and probably what we won't talk about those milestones, because they're not necessarily large enough in the total scheme of things of Lockheed Martin to mention. But amongst them is finalizing this off-the-shelf system and putting it in place in country. We think we're about there. We're doing that and we think it's now has the capabilities that were promised in the contract. Now, it gets down to sort of the implementing and connecting a whole bunch of systems in country to this sort of command and control structure and making sure they all talk to each other and work each other.","There's probably another two years, I'm going to guess, Pete, worth of the work to do. And we'll surely keep you apprised as we go through the next few quarters, if there's any issues there. But, we think we have this thing sized about right as we said \u2013 as I said earlier. I mean this is unfortunately not the first charge that we've taken on this contract. We took some charges throughout, I think, the last \u2013 the biggest one was in 2015. But, we sort of took some incremental changes in 2016, but we think we've sized this thing about right.","The reason this was important to us, Pete, was \u2013 and the reason we took the chance to do an international program with fixed price development is, as Marillyn said in our opening remarks, no one's ever done this before. I mean, this \u2013 \"some people, this is hard work.\" But the good news is if we do this hard work, there's a lot of international customers who would like to have this capability for their own integrated air missile defense systems. And we think there's even potentially a play to come back within the U.S. government for this capability as well. So it's pretty unique in its capabilities, but it was pretty difficult to do and we're hoping there's a tail of business that comes along with our successful completion of this contract.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hey, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Bruce, Missiles and Fire Control, can you touch on the program mix and margin profile there? I think the margins have been coming down in that business for several years now, I think that you've primarily cited the mix of business within that. Can you talk about when you see that mix kind of bottoming out in the margin profile from here? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Sure, David. So, Missile and Fire Control (sic) [Missiles and Fire Control] (41:26), I probably have sounded like a broken record on this, but there is a lot of things going on, and we've talked about them in the past, but I'll probably repeat myself here a little bit. We had a number of some larger programs, especially, sort of the consumable OCO type contracts where we had HELLFIREs and guided multiple launch rocket systems, ATACMS missiles and the like, where we did \u2013 time after time would get continual orders on top of previous orders and we did well on those contracts. Sort of the volume aspects of that helped us a lot because there was quick need for those products and they did well for us.","We also completed a couple of larger programs relative to PAC-3s, couple larger contracts that we also performed better than what we negotiated on. And all of this sort of culminated at the end of 2015, middle of 2016 where we had to start renegotiating those contracts over and basically, you snap a new line in the sand and you start off with your historical good performance and you've got to sort of achieve that again to make those sorts of margins.","So, we had a bit of a reset, if you will, on the new business where we've done previously better than negotiated; and on the new business, we started off booking essentially at the negotiated amount, so that's part of it.","The other part is, we have made some strategic bids in Missiles and Fire Control, and fortunately, we have been successful on a couple of those bids. Primary amongst that was the JAGM missile, the Joint Air-to-Ground missile, which is essentially the replacement long-term for the HELLFIRE missile. We did go into that, as you might expect, pricing it as this \u2013 if it was a strategic opportunity. We won that but what that says is during the development, parts of that program, its margin is much, much lower than what we would historically see at Missiles and Fire Control.","There is a couple of other opportunities and development programs, not all of which we can talk about, that we either are performing on or we expect to and hope to win on, that also sort of drags to our historical level of higher margins on Missiles and Fire Control. And frankly, if we win those and perform on them as we expect, I would not expect to see huge improvements in the Missiles and Fire Control margins over the next couple of years.","And that would be a good thing because the volume that we would have on that new business will be the type of business that will support us for literally decades to come. So it's worth sort of the strategic investments and the strategic bids that we put forward. But it does come at the expense of historically high margins.","Having said that, I'm very pleased with Missile and Fire Control, it's not like they are our problem child whatsoever, we are still looking at just south of, what, 15% margins, so it's a highly, highly performing business, highest margin within the corporation still and we would expect that to be the case going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, Jason.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Marillyn, I wonder if you would \u2013 hey, good morning. Wonder if you would spend a few minutes on talking about the opportunity set in front of you here over the next 12 to say 18 months, I know we've got things like T-X trainer and JSTARS and a little bit further out there is maybe Future Vertical Lift here on the domestic side, and then maybe some of the international opportunities, MEADS, THAAD, Aegis in the European, Middle East and Asian areas?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. Just starting off with F-35, if you just look at the ramp-up on that program, it's very significant over the next few years. And when we get to full rate production, we'll probably be delivering roughly 200 aircraft a year.","So, that's a big opportunity. The next five years, we think about 50% of the orders will be in the international marketplace. We're continuing to see additional interest from a lot of countries around the F-35 that are currently not in the program of record, so we expect that over the next few to several years, that we'll continue to see additional countries that will become buyers of the F-35.","In the area of missile defense, that continues to be a great demand for us internationally. You mentioned Aegis and PAC-3, also THAAD is another one that we expect. Areas like in the Middle East, we expect that there we will continue to see opportunities. You've probably seen that there was a notification on Qatar and we think some other countries in that region will also be considering THAAD as we go forward.","And then beyond that, Aegis, as we've sold some systems on Aegis, we'll continue to see opportunities for, potentially, for Aegis Ashore, which is the land-based Aegis and we continue to sell PAC-3s. So, in the missile defense arena, PAC-3 MSE, the extended range, we expect we'll continue to see strong demand.","And then there is MEADS. Germany has already selected MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, and we're moving forward on that. We expect to get underway this year with a contract with them \u2013 or late this year, and we'll see other countries; watch that space. We've had interest from Poland and others.","And then, continuing on the international front, F-16, as you've probably seen, there has been an informal Congressional notification for selling F-16s to Bahrain, up to 19 or 20 aircraft. And we continue to be looking at the opportunity for selling F-16s to India, which could be a much bigger buy by India over time, as they move through their process.","So, and then F-16 upgrades, we were doing from South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and others that have made a selection on that. We think, with that large fleet that's out there, that we'll continue to see other countries that will look at F-16 upgrades.","So on the aircraft front and the missile defense front, continuing opportunities. And beyond that, I mentioned LRASM in my discussion on the front end with my opening remarks. We think there is a big opportunity for LRASM for the U.S. government as we move forward. We've sold JASSMs to other countries, so LRASM even could be a potential for international opportunities.","T-X and JSTARS are two bids that, this year, that we are participating in. We think we have a very strong offering on T-X, the next trainer replacing the T-38, that capability we're offering is a T-50A, It's a very mature program that has low risk, and we can accelerate the schedule and meet the needs of the Air Force up to two years earlier than probably a clean sheet design could do, or maybe more. So, we're very much ready with our offering on that; we expect to be very competitive in that opportunity.","JSTARS, we've got a great team pulled together on JSTARS as well, and we're bidding on that opportunity.","Future Vertical Lift is a little further out, but of course, we're in the demonstration phase, in the technical demonstration on that, and are teaming on that capability. So, we expect to be in a good position for Future Vertical Lift as we go forward.","And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, we will participate in that competition, and we think we have a strong offering and LRSO. So, we are engaged in, not only our current portfolio that we believe is very strong and there is a strong demand for, but we are pursuing some big opportunities in other areas.","And I didn't mention our Space Systems area, but commercial satellites and the satellites for the military, as we continue to grow that portfolio as well.","So, I think I've kind of walked around the system. I did mention C-130, I mean, there continues to be interest in the C-130 in countries like India and Saudi Arabia and France and Germany, and we hope to \u2013 we are currently on a multi-year with the U.S. government, we would expect them to continue to purchase C-130s going forward.","And I think that \u2013 Bruce, any others, maybe, you can add to that? I've kind of tried to walk around the portfolio. We have a very broad portfolio, as you all know, and a very strong portfolio. So, we're really pleased with how well it's supported in the current budget, and what's in the budget deliberations going forward for the U.S. government. But around the world, we've got great opportunities internationally.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","No, I think you covered it.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Marillyn, maybe I'll follow up a little bit more on that F-16 comments you were just making here. Just a couple of items here, or a few items here on that. So, I saw you moving the line out of Forth Worth to Greenville. I thought that was interesting decision, considering you're only having a few remaining in backlog. So, what does it mean that you're moving the line?","You mentioned Bahrain as a possible order here, is that something you could see happen this year, because I think you'll \u2013 you don't have enough in backlog, I think, to finish the year, if I'm correct about that?","And then, also, it seems that the Air Force is interested in extending the life of the F-16, some kind of SLEP program, and maybe you could discuss the implications of that, and what you're expectations are there?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Rich. Well, first off, yes, we are moving the line to Greenville, and let me just give a little background on that. I think we've let you all know that we will be delivering our last F-16s off the line in Fort Worth later this year, and then actually, the line will stop for a period of time. It was important for us to continue to look at restarting that line. We know how to do that, we have a robust supply chain that has been able to increase and decrease over the life of the F-16, and deal with changes in quantities, and we're ready to restart that line.","The reason we're moving to Greenville is, we're ramping up production on the F-35 in Forth Worth, we need the facilities there for what we're doing. Greenville is a great operation that has a strong talent and good facilities there. So, it will be a final assembly and check-out facility for the F-16 there, it's just \u2013 we basically produce the aircraft through our supply chain elements of it, and we will assemble it there and deliver it from Greenville.","And we're excited about that, it's a \u2013 we've also selected Greenville as our site for producing the final assembly of the T-X, of our trainer opportunity as well, the T-50A, so \u2013 and we have demonstrated the capability for doing fighters in that facility, so we're excited about it being the place for the future F-16s.","In terms of it being this year, for Bahrain, getting an order this year, we feel good about it, but it's really government to government, so we'll have to go through the finishing up on the formal congressional notification and get an order underway. And we look forward to that opportunity. We're very encouraged by that, and we would produce those in Greenville for that reason.","In terms of the F-16 SLEP, the Service Life Extension Program, we were pleased to see that the F-16 was designated to have an extended useful life. It has been a strong program for us, and so we continue, as I said, to do upgrades around the world, so that airframe and its capability, it has demonstrated it can fly many more hours and that will open the opportunity for putting new systems on it, new weapons systems, new mission systems and radars and things of that nature. So we see that as a very positive for that fleet, for it to continue to serve our customers, not only U.S. Air Force, but customers around the world for many, many years to come.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks so much. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on the JV adjustments you took. And then ULA, I guess was strong in the quarter; my understanding was, it was expected to be down about $150 million from the 3.25 (54:59) last year. What's changed there? And then maybe on the revenue recognition accounting changes expected to come next year, just a quick thought on what that should do. I assume that would be a big plus for the CH-53? Thanks.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So, Cai, maybe I'll take the JV, and then let Bruce pickup on the AWE and Bruce you can fill anything more on that. The JV itself, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this is a non-cash impairment charge. And we are actually a minority interest in this JV.","Back in the mid to late 2000s, the UAE was looking for U.S. partners that would help them to develop their fixed wing and rotary wing sustainment capabilities so that they could support their aircraft in-country and look at broadly supporting beyond the UAE, other countries' aircraft. And we entered in this joint venture in 2010. At the time, we were a 20% owner in it from a Lockheed Martin standpoint, Sikorsky was a 20% owner, and the UAE entity had 60%. Of course, when we acquired Sikorsky in 2015, that increased our position. So, we are a 40% owner in the joint venture.","The joint venture has been successful. It's been a good joint venture, it's got about 4,000 employees, sales of about $1.5 billion a year. It's been very profitable every year with equity earnings that come back to us through Sikorsky and now to us, both our share and Sikorsky's share. And it's generated to offset credits for us that have satisfied a lot of obligations for us for the programs that we have in country. So from that standpoint, it's successful.","The ambition, though, for that entity is for it to grow regionally and become a sustainment center for the region. And so facilities were built and machinery and equipment procured in order to prepare for growing beyond just the UAE market. And unfortunately those projections haven't materialized.","The fact that oil prices have been lower has not helped matters, but it's been a damper on what the outlook was for it. So, the charge basically recognizes the diminished value of those assets and the lower demand environment. We still have aspirations for that entity, and hopefully, we will see longer term that outlook. But as we looked at it today, the reduced business prospects, the entity determined that they needed to impair certain assets, and so that's what we dealt with.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","And Kyle, I'll take a shot at your other two questions. ULA, I think your analysis is right on. And you should think about it's really just the phasing in the year.","We're still expecting that ULA will be about two thirds or so of the equity earnings that we'll get from that entity this year versus what we received last year. It just so happens the first quarter was disproportionately higher than it was compared to the first quarter of last year.","But we would expect that to come back down to the levels we talked about other than the upper that we mentioned in the first quarter. They're going to come down to levels we talked about in the January call, that's still our expectation for ULA.","And then lastly you asked around rev rec, revenue recognition standard that becomes effective January 1, 2018. I'll speak for myself here, Kyle, I'm starting to get insight into sort of rev rec the old way, if you will, and rev rec the new way. Our expectation and what we've disclosed in the Ks and the Qs is that we wouldn't expect to see a large change relative to our sales and\/or earnings even though we are going to be changing some contracts that are currently on a delivery-based or what we call units-of-delivery-based method of sales recognition to a cost-to-cost methodology.","So that will have some impacts on sort of our opening balance sheet under the new rev rec approach, as well as sort of our opening backlog position, but I wouldn't think the sort of the run rate if you will, of sales and earnings going forward would be a material difference at all and that's sort of what I'm seeing as I look at the data so far.","We'll give you a whole lot more insight into that in the second quarter. And when we give you our third quarter trend information for 2018, my expectation is that we'll be able to give you a better insight as to exactly what we're expecting to see 2018's impact as a result of rev rec change, but again I wouldn't expect it to be very large.","Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Karen, we're coming up on the hour, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Good afternoon. Bruce, I was hoping you could touch on cash flow and the couple of things you brought up on the call, one was the Sikorsky cash flow growth expectation into 2018, and the second is the resolution of the F-35, kind of with the trajectory there? And I want to put in context, so you have a $1 billion after-tax pension headwind to operating cash flow in 2018 that we know about; are the two things you mentioned, the F-35 and the Sikorsky, enough to give you confidence that you can grow operating cash flow exclusive of the pension after-tax?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Exclusive of the pension after-tax; I think the answer is pretty close. If you take out the planned pension contribution for next year, I think the short answer is yes to that question. We are doing the outlook right now, $6 billion for the year, 2017, we sort of teed up when we gave the $15 billion three-year goal of every year at or around $5 billion or so. With that $5 billion, I think it's pretty close; it's close enough that that'd probably be a good challenge for us to try to figure out how to make that happen.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So, let me wrap up. Since that was our last question, I want to conclude the call today. And I'll end by reinforcing our commitment to our strategy of growth in top-line sales and strong cash generation while at the same time providing our customers with world-class solutions to their continuous challenges and delivering our stockholders long-term value creation.","Thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in July. Karen, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher","Thank you, Shawn, and good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kubasik, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. By now, you've had an opportunity to review 2 releases from us today, one describing our first quarter performance and one describing the discussion I've had with our board regarding my retirement and our leadership transition plan. I'll start with the latter.","I'm very pleased to announce that our board has elected Chris Kubasik to be our next Chief Executive Officer and Marillyn Hewson to be our next President and Chief Operating Officer, with both appointments effective January 1, 2013. To assure a smooth and seamless transition, I'll continue to serve as CEO through the remainder of 2012 and, with shareholder and board approval, will serve as Chairman of the Board through January 2014.","Chris and Marillyn, along with Bruce and many others, have been full partners for many years in evolving our strategies and our operating concepts to deliver superior value to customers and sustain value to shareholders. Together, we have built a great leadership team with bench strength, an excellent workforce, a sound strategy, solid portfolio and an operational momentum upon which to build value. I'm very proud of them and all that they've accomplished. And I'm confident there'll be much more to come.","Let me anticipate at least one of your questions today. Why make this decision now? Well, I must tell you, I love what I do here. I believe in our mission, our values, our purpose, our people, our customers. Just having the opportunity to contribute at this level is such a privilege. I'm grateful to our board, and I'm grateful to our employees for the chance and for the support.","It would be great if it could go on forever, but there are realities. I'll be 61 years old in September, and 62.5 when the transition plan I've described is complete. We have a mandatory retirement age here at 65. By the end of this year, I will have served as our CEO for more than 8 years, as President and Chief Operating Officer for about 4 years before that and as Chief Financial Officer before that. By any measure, that's a full period of service.","When I assessed the complexities in the global security and economic environments, that new reality we've talked so much about, with the increasing velocity and volatility of global events that will shape our decision-making over many years, certainly, beyond my mandatory retirement age, I wanted to assure that we have a tested and trusted senior leadership team in place who can provide continuity and evolve our strategies over the longer term. We have that team in place now, ready to go, and you know them well.","I've also studied leadership transition environments and have made my own assessments about what approaches are most successful and what works best. Let me give you 3 thoughts here. First, I believe longer-cycle transitions that assure a more complete transfer of responsibility are more effective than shorter ones, particularly for complex long cycle businesses like ours. Announcing our transition in April 2012 with an effective date in January 2013 gives us 8 months to focus on transition. And as I mentioned, with the support of our shareholders and the board, I'll remain as Chairman for another year through January 2014.","Second, I think it's very healthy to draw highly qualified successors from inside the company, essentially a grow-your-own philosophy. We have an exceptionally productive talent management, leadership development and succession planning process that has had full board involvement over many years. And both Chris and Marillyn have had a series of very successful rotational assignments that have demonstrated their talent and their ability.","And third, I believe transitions are more successful when the company is strong, and we are strong in every sense. Leadership, people, culture, financial flexibility, strategy, portfolio, all in place, which led to the performance that we saw in 2011 and that which we're reporting on the first quarter of 2012.","That is not to say that there is not more work to do, because there is. But there is always more work to do. That's why we've committed ourselves to a philosophy of continuous improvement. Every generation of leaders has their challenges. Probably the one constant of executive life is that there will be challenges. Our leaders are up to the task.","Chris is on the call with us today. Congratulations, Chris.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Well, thanks, Bob, and I'm grateful to you and the other members of our board for your confidence in my ability to lead this great company, which has a 100-year history of protecting Americans and allies around the world. We work with the best team in the industry everyday, and I will build upon the foundation we've created to carry out our mission to support our customers.","I want to assure everyone we'll remain focused on meeting our strategic, operational and financial commitments; on growing our business profitably; on innovating relevant new technologies; on further engaging our employees; and on returning value to investors. I've worked closely with Marillyn for almost 15 years, and I look forward to partnering with her in our new roles. Her 29 years with Lockheed Martin and experience in 3 business areas in corporate headquarters have given her unique insights in executing our strategy and sustaining our emphasis on operational excellence and affordability. I'm confident the transition will be seamless and successful, and I look forward to reporting our progress along the way.","Again, Bob, thanks to you and the board for this opportunity. I'll turn it back to you.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Chris. Again, congratulations to you, and congratulations to Marillyn.","Let me turn to a very brief summary of the first quarter because we do want to get on to Bruce, and we want to move on to your questions. I see the quarter as a strong start to 2012 and a continuation of the execution momentum we demonstrated last year. We grew sales by 6%, earnings from continuing operations by 20% and earnings per share by 29%. Solid program execution and effective risk reduction coupled with ongoing cost-reduction initiatives lifted segment operating margins to 11.9% in the quarter, up from 11% the prior year.","Cash generation was $458 million after making planned pension contributions of $505 million. Our cash deployment to shareholders in the quarter totaled $569 million, reflecting payments of $327 million in dividends and share repurchases of $242 million for the retirement of 2.7 million shares.","These results reflect the strength of our corporation and the quality and dedication of our workforce that I referred to earlier. Thanks to everyone in the company for the hard work.","Some uncertainty was relieved in the quarter with the delivery of the president's FY '13 budget request to Congress on February 6. The proposed defense budget outlines a base budget of $525 billion, with an overseas contingency operation budget of $88 billion. This budget reflects the new national security strategy outlined by the president and the secretary of defense. And the priorities within the budget generally align with our portfolio and our experience.","The Department of Defense remains on a course to reduce spending by $487 billion over the next 10 years in accordance with the requirements of the Budget Control Act, but there's been no meaningful movement on sequestration. I believe our views in opposition to the sequestration process are clear, and we'll continue to work to stop this action.","At the same time, we continue to work on affordability projects. From 2010 to 2011, we've lowered our overhead costs as reflected in our forward pricing rate proposals submitted to customers by almost $1.2 billion. Over the same period, we've removed 1.5 million square feet from facilities, and we're projecting the removal of an additional 2.9 million square feet through 2014.","Beyond facilities reductions, we have also had to implement painful employee reductions. Since 2008, the net reduction of our total workforce stands at about 18%, with 26% of those reductions in leadership positions. Business conditions and competitive pressures require us to continue to evaluate staffing levels and were the catalysts for the recently announced layoff of an additional 500 employees within our MS2 business.","Finally, let me turn to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Year-to-date, performance in the flight test program is ahead of plan. On the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, we are slightly ahead of plan for both the number of flights conducted and the number of test points earned. On the short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft, we are ahead of plan by about 60% on flights and about 22% on test points earned. And on the carrier variant, we're also ahead of plan by about 31% on flights and 32% on test points earned.","Contract negotiations continue on the Lot 5 program, with ongoing discussions between the customer and our F-35 team. We received our first counter offer from the government yesterday, and that's currently under evaluation. And we look forward to finalizing negotiations in the second quarter. We were pleased with the recent decision by the U.S. government to add 2 additional aircraft to Lot 5, bringing the revised procurement quantity to 32 aircraft.","Also, at midnight last Sunday, about 3,600 members of the International Association of Machinists Union in Fort Worth, Texas rejected our best and final offer and are on strike. The offer that we advanced was fair and competitive and balanced the interest of employees, the company and our customers as we seek to position our business to meet today's affordability challenges and win new business in the future.","For current Fort Worth Machinists Union employees, our offer included increases in wages, pension contributions, annual cost-of-living supplements and adjustments and a ratification bonus, but also sought to convert the defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for new hires that would join our workforce in the future. This position of moving from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for new employees has been applied consistently across our company for some time now since 2006, and I'm confident it's the right approach to meet the demands of our business.","Our operations will remain open, and we'll implement our contingency plan while focusing on meeting our commitments to our customers.","Now I'll have Bruce go through some of the details of the quarter, and then we'll open up the line for questions. Bruce?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the first quarter. We grew sales for the company by 6% over the -- our first quarter -- excuse me, our 2011 first quarter level. This growth was slightly better than expected, and I'll describe the drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit margins improved by 90 basis points to 11.9%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of charts. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 29%, driven by the higher sales volume, the margin improvement, as well as the lower share count compared with this time last year.","We generated approximately $460 million in cash from operations while making some expected payments that we discussed during the last call, including over $500 million of pension contributions made this quarter. As a result of our performance to begin the year, we increased our segment operating profit outlook by $50 million.","On Chart 4, we'll look at our sales by the 4 business areas. Sales for the company were slightly ahead of our expectations, with 3 of our 4 business areas growing in the quarter. Aeronautics led this growth with an 18% increase, driven primarily by accelerated and higher quantities of both C-130 and F-16 aircraft deliveries and the higher F-35 production volume.","Electronic Systems had 4% growth in the quarter, led by our Mission Systems & Sensors and Missiles and Fire Control business units. Space Systems started the year with a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. And IS&GS declined by 3%, driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS program. But this overall reduction was less significant than we had expected, with growth in our Intelligence line of business helping to mitigate the JTRS decline.","Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the 4 business areas. As you can see, most of the margin improvement that led to the company's 11.9% level was driven by Electronic Systems. This improvement was driven primarily by outstanding performance at our Missiles and Fire Control business unit across a large group of programs and also reflected the acceleration of a number of performance milestones and contractual actions that were expected to occur later in the year. The net of this performance and acceleration led us to increase the guidance for Electronic Systems' operating profit by $50 million for the year.","Turning to Chart 6 and our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations grew 29% over $1.57 per share we reported a year ago, again driven by the higher sales volume, margin improvement and lower share count. And our pension adjusted EPS at $2.41 grew by a strong 22% over last year.","Moving to Chart 7, you can see our updated outlook for the year. We're maintaining our sales outlook as most of the first quarter growth reflect the timing of deliveries and not an increase in the total deliveries for the year. Our segment profit outlook is $50 million higher than we provided in January as we just discussed. However, our earnings per share from continuing operations remains at $7.70 to $7.90 as a result of changes in several non-operational items. I'll discuss this further on the next chart. Finally, with the additional segment operating profit for the year, we believe that our cash from operations will be at least $3.8 billion.","On Chart 8, we'll discuss our earnings per share outlook of $7.70 to $7.90. This outlook recognizes the $50 million increase in segment operating profit worth $0.10 per share, and this offsets non-operational items of an equal amount. The first of these items is a net increase in unallocated expenses reflecting the change in our post-retirement benefit asset and liability levels, along with an increase in several corporate expense items, including our environmental remediation liabilities.","In addition to these non-operational cost increases, our expected average share count for calculating EPS increased due to both the higher-than-planned level of options exercised in the quarter and an increase in share price, resulting in less share count reduction for the planned $1 billion of share repurchases.","Chart 9 shows our sales guidance for the year, again reflecting no change from our initial guidance.","Chart 10 shows the $50 million increase in our segment operating profit outlook for the year, with all the change resulting from our increase in expectations for Electronic Systems.","And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 11. While we're mindful of the open labor negotiations in our Aeronautics business area and the potential impacts of sequestration, we're off to a good start for the year.","And with that, we're ready for your questions. Shawn?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","If it's okay, I actually have one question for Bruce and then what I think may be a quick question here for Bob. Bruce, I'm just looking at your Electronic Systems margins here, which seem to be well above expectations. I want to know if you could provide some color on the risk retirement events that allowed margins at ES to expand so much. And any specifics you could provide would be helpful there.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, 15% is obviously a little higher than we run in years' past. In fact, I think it's probably the highest rate for any of the business area, possibly in the history of the corporation. As I look at the performance adjustments in the quarter, they were unusually high in the first quarter. And as you said, particularly in Electronic Systems, most specifically within Missiles and Fire Control, think of it being about $150 million more first quarter this year than the first quarter last year. And as I look at that -- and I think we had accelerated performance milestones, as I said on the previous discussion, contractual action, a number of risk retirements. I'll give you a couple of examples. One, for instance, was we reached initial operating capability on our Sniper pods for the Australian F-18 aircraft this quarter where we expected to do that in a subsequent quarter this year. We also had a number of completions of block delivery items. And by that, I mean where we're shipping a large quantity of, in this case, missiles, HELLFIRE missiles, MLRSs and the like where, upon the completion of a group of deliveries, that results in a reduction of risk retirements for that block. And in some cases, that actually resulted in a reduction of warranty obligations. And so we had sort of a double whammy effect for those 2 events in the quarter earlier than planned. As I look throughout the rest of the year, Rich, I do think we're going to expect to return to lower levels of profit adjustments going forward in the remaining quarters. And I expect that total year will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2011. I think you had a question for Bob, did you?","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes, thanks, Bruce. Bob, at the risk of this being a somewhat sensitive topic, I want to know if I can get a comment from you on negotiations with the Machinists Union of Fort Worth. I want to know if you could talk about the impact of a protracted disagreement. Is this a situation that's serious enough where, for example, you think you have the potential to lay off personnel? And I'm only asking this because the news reports I'm looking at seem to indicate that the Union is making statements like they're ready for a long strike, that kind of thing.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, I appreciate the question, and it is a matter that we're focused on. I mentioned in discussions with the media earlier today that I was surprised that the IAM went on strike. And the reason was that we have not asked the IAM union workers in Fort Worth to do anything our other employees have not already done. For some time now, we've been converting the company from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan, and this is a practice that is not unique to our company. It is not unique in our industry, and it's a practice that's entirely consistent with today's economic realities. Nothing is being taken away from current union employees in the offer that we've presented. I believe it's very competitive in today's economy, reflecting our value of the work that's being done by our union employees. And it's not clear to me how, in this environment, how many new employees we'll be hiring in the future. But any new employees hired in the future will be offered a pension plan. And I personally think it would be an unfortunate outcome to have a strike over the principal issue of defined benefit pension plans for future hires to cause any unnecessary disruption in the F-35 program or any other program that would put the employment of our current workers at risk. Every action that this company has taken for many years now has been to stabilize our program base, particularly in the face of mounting uncertainty with regard to overall economic resources available. So I believe this action was certainly unwelcome. Having said that, we have a contingency plan in place. We're compelled now to execute that contingency plan, and we are. We continue to fly the airplanes, and we continue to build the airplanes. But I do believe, in every sense, the offer that we've put forward to the union was a fair and reasonable position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question, Bob, is on the F-35. We've seen, with the release of the budget the last few months, a lower ramp within -- over the next 5 years within -- for the U.S. And there's been a number of countries that have -- the waffling, I guess, publicly, of some of your customers internationally has continued. And I'm wondering if you could give us an update on your view on, I guess, where you stand on that, the potential cost spiral and all the issues that I know you're very focused on.","Robert J. Stevens","I would tell you, I think the actions that were taken recently, even with the phasing out of additional airplanes, added a little bit to a sense of stability in the program. We might be looking at quantities less than we would have preferred to see, but I think we've stabilized. I think the performance of the airplane is being quite recognized pretty broadly by customers. It is not to say we don't have challenges, but we're making progress against the set of challenges. We have known corrective actions for observations that have been made in the flight test program. I get reinforced -- reinforcing language from our partners pretty consistently, and we had a favorable decision in Japan. We're looking at Korea. We're working effectively with Israel on the international front. I think -- it's quite understandable to me, Joe, that the leadership in our partner governments are looking at their security challenges and their economic challenges, and they may be talking about phasing an airplane here or there. But it also strikes me as very clear that they are uniformly committed to a fifth-generation airplane, because they believe that airplane over the next 50 years will provide the maximum amount of security and the best investment of very scarce security dollars. So I think we've gotten some very strong reinforcing views of their commitment and interest in the program. It is our job to go execute that. And not to conflate issues, Joe, but that's why the strike was a bit of a surprise to me and why we'd liked to have this matter resolved.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on your cash deployment strategy and whether you're comfortable with the allocation that you currently have between buybacks, dividends and potentially acquisitions going forward.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, I think we're generally pleased with what we have done historically and where we are today. Robert, I know you know we look at this on a continuous basis. We're giving it a great attention now. But I think it has served the company well, and I think it has served the interest of investors well.","Bruce L. Tanner","Rob, I'll jump in from my perspective as well. I look at our cash deployment practice, and I think the key word there has been flexibility and specifically, flexibility to address sort of 4 constituents that I always think of relative to cash deployment. Obviously, starting with folks like yourself and shareholders where we consider dividends, stock repurchase. I also think the ability to have some fairly quick action on acquisitions, by having some cash in the bank to enable us to do some quick decisions and not have to wait on financing, for instance, is a help as well. I look at customers and there, the ability to make the critical investments from both a capital expenditure and IRAD perspective, our independent research and development. I think having some consideration for addressing potential continuing resolution impacts in advance of sequestration impacts, including the effects of small suppliers and being able to decide what makes sense from a disruption perspective as far as helping some of those smaller suppliers through these periods of funding uncertainty, I think, is also helpful. I look at employees as another constituent, and that's -- primarily, that relates to funding the pension plan, which I think we've demonstrated our willingness to do that quite long, or for quite some time. And lastly, I look at debt holders. And there, I think maintaining the appropriate ratings levels relative to our desires going forward, keeping a balance between the demands of equity holders and debt holders is a critical element there as well. And I think the question is sort of maintaining that balance and maintaining that flexibility going forward. I think Chris has one other add here.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Rob. And as you would expect, I've obviously been part of the decision and strategy and perfectly aligned with Bob and Bruce. And I don't anticipate any changes in our cash deployment strategy as I look to the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Following up on the last question, particularly, Bruce, it sounds a little bit like your strategy is evolving as the environment changes. You talked before about -- obviously lead with the dividend, highest yield in the sector. And you've talked about continuing that momentum, maintaining the strong buyback and reminded us in the past that you've got the cash balance to allow for that. But now with the stock where it is, you're guiding to a $1-billion buyback. So have we seen the peak in the buyback at this point? And is there any difference in your M&A strategy? It seems like you're preserving cash for more options than you did even just a quarter ago.","Bruce L. Tanner","Rob, I think we still have a long-standing 50% free cash flow commitment to shareholders. That's obviously been changing over time such that now, the dividend practically gets us to the 50% of free cash flow. I want to be able to remain opportunistic as far as share repurchases are concerned. And as you might expect, if we took a look at what we spent in the first quarter, this year, we actually spent almost the exact same amount as we spent in the first quarter of last year. So we're tracking very closely to both $0.25 billion that we committed to as well as short tracking to where we were last year. I think we'll be opportunistic. I mean, obviously, the stock has run up some on price. I think our commitment relative to the dividends has been very consistent. We've had 8 consecutive years -- 9 consecutive years, excuse me, of double-digit increases in our dividend policy. And as I always say, I think that's -- our past track record is the best indicator of where we're going in the future with that -- with regard to that. I do think, on the acquisition side, we are still in that marketplace, as I've said on the first quarter call. I do like having the flexibility to make quick decisions relative to engaging. There is more competition, I think, with some of the acquisitions that we're looking at. And so I think there's not a huge change as you said, kind of a change in the style going forward relative to cash deployment. I wouldn't say it's a huge change, but we are mindful of -- this is a little bit a different environment than we've been in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I believe you had 12 weeks versus 13, and yet your sales were particularly strong, and I know you had a pull forwards in aeronautical. Can you give us a little more color and just why they were quite so strong x the aeronautical, which I think you've already explained?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Cai, I'll take that one on. It was 12 weeks to your point, and I'll maybe anticipate the next question, the 14th week happens in the third quarter of this year. So you may see the offset of that in the third quarter coming up. Most of the sales increase was, frankly, on deliveries as opposed to cost volume and is -- and particularly true, obviously in the Aeronautics business area, but that was also true, in large part, in Electronic Systems. I think as I looked at least at IS&GS, I was particularly pleased to see where they ended the first quarter, even though they were down 3%, the fact that it was down 3%. And they've got a fairly large portion of sales that are sort of cost-based POC, percentage of completion-based sales and were still only down 3%. I think it's a real help as far as me feeling good about their performance for the rest of the year. I mentioned some growth in Intelligence that helped offset some of the AMF JTRS reduction. That obviously would have been greater had we had another week in the quarter. So I think that's benefited us. Again, I think, as I said at the -- with the prepared remarks, I think we were a little bit higher in sales in the first quarter than we had anticipated, especially given the 12 weeks. I think it's a little too early. Obviously, we held the sales outlook constant for the year. I think it's a little too early to say there's an increase in the rest of the year out there. So we've kept -- committed to the $45 billion to $46 billion. And I'll leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in IS&GS in that -- just trying to understand, when you look forward -- we've seen a little bit of contraction in backlog. And if you're looking forward and you split this into defense, intel and civil, how are you seeing the outlook right now over the next few years in those different markets? And then what are you seeing also in terms of the competitive environment? Are you seeing more competition on individual contracts as they come up?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Doug, I'll try that one as well. As we look at IS&GS, and I'm just kind of looking at some of my notes here, I think the surprise -- not a surprise, but the biggest driver of the downer in the first quarter, as I said within the defense line of business, again offset in large part by the Intelligence side, civil kind of stayed flat relative to the prior year's first quarter. And I think, going forward, that's probably going to be somewhat the story for the rest of this year. The Civil business is going to be flat to slightly lower than it was last year. Defense was going to be down, primarily because of the AMF JTRS. Intelligence is going to be down to slightly flat, but possibly with some growth because of what we saw happen in the first quarter. I'm optimistic really in all 3 lines of business relative to our ability to grow some of the cyber activities. Cutting across, as I've said, all 3 lines of business. I think we're finally starting to see -- I know you guys have probably been tired of us talking about cyber for so long without much results across the industry, but I think we're starting to see some traction there that has been helping us to have some growth there. Going forward, there's also opportunities. As you all notice, this is a business area where we have most of our adjacent market opportunities, and that includes the energy, health care. We made the acquisition last year with QTC from a health care perspective. And I think that's got some prospects to help maybe mitigate some of the -- particularly lightness in the defense in the near term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you just talk -- and guess it's mostly Bruce, but can you talk a little bit about the order environment? In the past, you talked about the first half would be relatively weak. And I know the Aeronautics shipments were up, but the backlog there did decline $2 billion sequentially. So can you just talk about how that backlog in the order activity is going to look as we look through the year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, sure, Sam. I like to think we teed it up as we expected to happen in the first quarter. I think in the January, probably said we expect it to go down sequentially. I'll say, as I sit here today, I think second quarter is going to go down from the first quarter, although I'll say a lot of that is dependent upon the ongoing F-35 negotiations. So depending on when the LRIP 5 negotiation finishes, depending on when we get additional funding for the Undefinitized Contractual Action or the UCA for LRIP 6 and depending on when we get the long-lead funding for LRIP 7, that will bounce between second and third quarter likely. If those all were to happen in the second quarter, we might actually see some growth. If not, I think we'll have a big third quarter. We are expecting in the third quarter to have some good government satellite orders. We're also expecting the F-16 mod program for the Taiwanese government to happen in the third quarter. And in fourth quarter, we always expect that to be our largest order of all 4 quarters. That's where we get the orders for the fiscal year, the new fiscal year coming up. And think about it as fleet, ballistic missile, PAC-3 and, in this case, the C-5 FY '13 order, which is getting bigger and bigger every year as those quantities go up. So I think I keyed up at the last call that we thought by the end of this year we'd get close to where we were at the end of last year, and I still think that's kind of where we see it as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on cash. I want to focus in on the cadence for cash generation for the rest of this year, having you remind us perhaps of what your pension contribution plans are for this year. Perhaps pension contributions for next year as well. And just talk about the impact of FAS\/CAS Harmonization and how you are viewing that at this point from cash generation as we move into some of the out-years. But if you could give us a flavor of cadence for the rest of this year, what cash might do next year, particularly as it relates to pension contributions. And then longer term, what FAS\/CAS is going to do for you.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Jason, let me try to address all of those for you. You talked about the cadence of cash for the year and pension contributions. I tried to tee up actually on the, I think -- probably the December call or the October call, excuse me. If not October, definitely January, that we're going to have a little different profile in cash in 2012 as maybe compared to prior years where we're going to have a lower first half of the year in cash and probably a higher second half of the year than we've experienced in previous years. I still think that's going to happen. First quarter obviously showed -- followed suit to that pattern, if you will. Second quarter, I'm expecting it to look a lot like the first quarter basically. We've already made a $600 million contribution to the pension plan. That satisfies all of the required contributions to the pension plan in 2011. That's the full $1.1 billion roughly. We also had 2 tax payments as we normally do in the second quarter, and that's why it's keeping it at that $0.5 billion level. We do think the second half of the year will be much higher than the first 2 quarters and get to the $3.8 billion. Again, we told you and at least I told you in the prepared remarks that I -- we're increasing or at least feel more confident in our ability to generate a $3.8 billion, at least that much, with the additional operating profit that we're generating. I think you asked -- I'm trying to recall this. I think you asked what the contribution for pensions was next year. It grows fairly considerably. Just think of it as $1.1 billion this year. It's probably another $1 billion-ish next year to $2.1 billion or so. The CAS contribution grows slightly, maybe $300 million or $400 million as we sit here today. The real -- I think the real heart of your question, Jason, is so what happens over time with that contribution? And you should think of us from a sort of a CAS Harmonization perspective as having roughly $4 billion of advanced contributions to the ERISA versus what we recovered from a CAS perspective. And so what CAS Harmonization is doing is spreading that advanced funding, if you will, that $4 billion over the period of the CAS Harmonization recovery. So think of that as 2013 through 2017. So that'll be spread -- not quite peanut butter but 25% increments each year. 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% over that period of time. So we expect the operating cash will get a pretty significant benefit from the recovery of that previously funded ERISA payments over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions on Aeronautics. First, can you give us your latest view on what 2012 versus 2011 units by program should look like? And then if you could provide any commentary on '13 versus '12 as well, even if just directionally, that'd be helpful. And then on Aeronautics' margins that kind of been reset lower as you're layering in more lower-margin revenue, the guidance, I guess, implies they kind of moved back towards '11 through the rest of the year. I'm just wondering if you could provide any comments on -- your thoughts on the direction of the Aeronautics margin beyond 2012 for the next couple of years.","Bruce L. Tanner","Noah, I'll take that as well. So in terms of the deliveries by program, I think was the first part of your question, maybe '12 versus '11, I think we're up pretty significantly in our F-16 deliveries, especially in the year 2012 versus '11. We're going to be somewhere around the 40 aircraft in 2012 for F-16s versus -- I think we did 22 in 2011. Quite a few of those get delivered off of the Turkish assembly line. I think more than 1\/2, if I recall, come off the Turkish line. The rest of those come off of the Fort Worth F-16 line. C-130s are fairly constant to last year. We'll do -- I think we did 33 last year. We'll do that number, maybe 34 this year. The other program has got some quantity increases as the C-5 program. We delivered 2 last year. We'll likely do about 6 this year. I think the F-35 is probably well known and will stay fairly flat in that period of time, somewhere in the 30 aircraft mode. I'll remind you again, we're still booking those early Low-Rate initial Production contracts on a percentage of completion basis. So sales will not tie to the deliveries of those aircraft, if you will. And then I think you talked about the Aeronautics margin this year and going forward. We have been talking about the aero margin coming down when the associated volume of the F-35 program starts to pick up. And that program brings with it greater weight at a lower margin. We still think that's the case. I think as I look forward, we're going to come down some from where we are in 2012. Frankly, we benefited in 2011, and we're still benefiting in 2012 from a number of the cost-reduction activities that we've put in place over the past 18 months or so. Think of those, as Bob talked about, some facility issues or facility reduction, some headcount reductions. Some of that benefits the U.S. government. Some of that benefits the contractor, in this case, us. And we're seeing that materialize in margin improvements, not just in Aeronautics but especially in Electronic Systems as well. That helped 2012 from where I kind of thought we'd be a year ago. I still think we're going to come off that number, the 11% number going forward, because of the F-35 volume. We'll be somewhere in the 10-ish. 10%, 10.5% range would be my guesstimate over the next couple of years from a margin perspective for Aero.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bob, you talked about the flight test program for the F-35 tracking ahead of schedule. I'm curious if you can talk about it not from the hardware side but from the software side and kind of some of the schedule milestones that you're looking at there, where you are relative to the respective block schedules and whether you're on par with the plan or still tracking a few months behind.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, Myles. It just so happens that we have our Chief Operating Officer here with us today who knows everything there is to know about F-35 software schedules.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Myles let me talk about Block 2A. That's the next milestone that we're focused on. We're a couple of months behind schedule. There's some pressure on that. The good news is that both ourselves and our customers see this status in the same fashion, and we're working on a recovery plan. So sometime in the middle of 2012, whether it's July or September, in that time frame, we will be in a position to deliver Block 2A. And again, the ultimate delivery under the development plan for the remaining of the software is due in the 2016, 2017 time frame. So we have 3 years to get to 2B and the IOC. So I'm pleased with the progress that we're making. About 90% of the airborne software code has already been written. And a little more than 85% is in the lab and in flight tests. So we're tracking this on a regular basis, made some good progress here of late and confident the team will deliver.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 margin. Based on the lot of disclosure that you gave in the report, it looks like the F-35 margin on the production went up this year from last year. If you could just talk a little bit about what caused that and where we might expect it to go.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, George. As usual, you're pretty perceptive. And I think you gave us a back-handed compliment on the disclosure, so we appreciate that as well. I'll pass that along to the team. The F-35 margins on the production side on the Low-Rate Initial Production contracts -- I think I tried to tee up in the last couple of calls that we're nearing completion of the deliveries of each one of the early, early LRIP contracts. And so in the case of, I believe, of LRIP 1 and LRIP 2, we're far enough along on deliveries of those 2 in particular, that we did have some performance adjustments on the positive side, simply reflecting the fact that we've come -- in the case of LRIP 1, we've delivered those aircraft. In the case of LRIP 2, we're making very good progress on completions of the aircraft out of the factory for that lot as well. And as you would expect, the risk retirements associated with that progress enabled us to make an improvement in the performance adjustments that we just talked about. Going forward, I think there might be some potential for some additional on the latter -- additional LRIP 2 or LRIP 3. I don't think anything sizable. And I think the overall margins as far as where we see it is kind of -- think of between mid and double-digit sorts of levels for the year, is where we think the LRIP contracts will come out in total.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes, and I just wanted to circle back on F-35 for a second and get your opinion on exactly how you expect the Congress to come back with these markups and what else you would expect, whether there's additional aircraft that could be brought back into the program in '13 and '14.","Robert J. Stevens","I believe that the fiscal '13 bill, which is on the hill now, is being marked. And let me say so far, because we're not completely through these discussions. I think the early indication is the House marked it 29 airplanes, the Senate has not yet marked. Our conclusion after discussions, again recognizing we're not through with the process, is that there's a good level of support for the quantity of the program that's been described in the rephasing of the production plan. So I have this sense that there is a view that we've got the program better managed and better focused than we're earning value in both the flight test program and on the production line and that we need to stabilize the production build, focus on cost reduction and affordability and there's a general level of support for the quantities that Bruce and I have referred you to over time. We see those quantities as being, let me say, within a range of 30 to 32-ish kind of airplanes flat for a couple of years, and that's the U.S. content. So I think -- and a corollary to your question is can that be changed? I don't think it's likely to be changed from the U.S. domestic buy. But we might see an increase in airplanes, probably not in the very near term, but we could see an increase in airplanes during this flattish period where international customers to come forward and combine their buy with the U.S. buy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'd wanted to go back, this is probably for Bruce, and talk about the kind of elephant in the room and sequestration and contingency planning and how you prepare for that kind of looming wall. And I recall, last year, as we led up to the debt ceiling negotiation and the potential for a government shutdown, you dialed back a bit on the cash deployment in the case that you may need it to self-fund some things. And so I wonder if there are scenarios that you evaluate as we move closer to the end of the year and you think about some of the things that may happen in terms of sequestration and ways you may deal with it if there's a scenario where we could see that sort of action being taken again.","Bruce L. Tanner","Carter, great question. And as you would probably expect, we are looking at multiple scenarios. I'll be honest here and say they're difficult because they're kind of scenarios of our own making since we don't have a whole lot of direction that we can rely on, as far as what the effects of sequestration will actually have on an individual program basis. So as I said, you would expect us to be doing some scenario playing out. We're doing that right now as we speak. I think we'll get a little better visibility, possibly as we head into the summer time frame from our customer in this regard. At least, as I've looked at it, Carter, the thing that I'm watching the closest, and I think may be the most interesting part relative to 2012 going forward, is the very likely chance that we're going to have a continuing resolution in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. So in the fourth quarter of 2012. And I think it's going to be an interesting study to see if our government customers -- by definition, continuing resolution normally says you kind of spend at the same level of the new fiscal year as you did at the prior fiscal year. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in this continuing resolution with the prospects of a sequestration 3 months after the continuing resolution will start, if it starts. And specifically, whether or not customers feel comfortable or not sort of holding the line at the same level as the prior fiscal year, or whether or not we see a reduction in the continuing resolution in anticipation of sequestration. So those obviously are prospects that we're concerned about. You read what I was trying to describe relative to cash deployment rank. We're trying to keep all of our options open there and do what makes the most efficient sense for us to continue performing throughout the rest of this calendar year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J.

This is something I know that you guys evaluate on a constant basis. But what's the latest status now that we've got this kind of fog bank out there with sequestration and everything else and what you're seeing on the budgets?","Robert J. Stevens","You're -- I think you refer to it as fog bank. The uncertainty associated with sequestration does add a new dimension to portfolio shaping. We have this portfolio shaping over time. We very much like the quality of the portfolio we have now. We think the portfolio in the core business actually has the potential for future growth with international expansion. And as Bruce mentioned in his remarks earlier, we're looking to add content to the company through adjacent markets. We're constantly evaluating this portfolio. I rather think what you should expect to see from us are cost reductions of the nature we've been describing in facilities consolidations that unfortunately are very difficult and painful reductions in force, where the programs are relevant to the businesses have been reshaped. We're focusing maximum attention on efficiency that drives affordability for our customers. I would like to get some more visibility as to the more specific consequences of sequestration because it's such a significant number. And as Bruce mentioned, it's not very specifically detailed that we would like to see more about that. And then we would add that as an overlay to our ongoing evaluation of how our portfolio is performing today and likely to perform in the future. We have a sufficient amount of firepower to add to our portfolio. We have sufficient talent and leadership in the company to add resources to any segment of that portfolio to either improve its performance or to take segments of our portfolio into new markets with new customers to facilitate future growth. But insofar as sequestration is sitting out there, I think we're going to have to go along a little bit so that we have a broader knowledge base, and we'd like to make our decisions with a little higher confidence that we understand the circumstances and the implications of those decisions before we make them. So with the uncertainty, I think we're going to continue our evaluation here.","Jerry F. Kircher","Shawn, this is Jerry. I'm afraid we're coming up on the hour, and we do have a hard stop here today. So maybe we'll let Bob make some final comments? But we appreciate everybody's questions.","Robert J. Stevens","Well, certainly. Let me thank everybody again for joining the call today. We are going to stay focused on being very strong in a tough environment and are taking all the actions that are necessary to drive future growth in the company. And we are all looking forward to seeing you in July. Thanks, Shawn.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our third quarter results.","As today's release details, we continued to move forward financially, operationally, and strategically while delivering critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DOD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.","Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full-year 2016 goals and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined core business areas. Bruce will provide a detail review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook, and assumptions in his comments later in the call.","The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher than normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events are dependent on completion of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year.","During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved two key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage.","Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant future share repurchases. In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit.","Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DOD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior-year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that Congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible.","While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY 2017 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full-year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings, and cash flows in 2017, as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years.","There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY 2017 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budgets funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DOD base budget. Reconciliation of the different DOD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case because it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY 2017 budgets to remove the uncertainty resulting from non-strategic short-term government funding actions.","Moving to operations, while there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model [CTOL] being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving initial operational capability, or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness.","The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft, as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plan for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers.","In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion fused sensors in its first live fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis weapons system, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of Naval Integrated Fire Control Missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis weapons system that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target.","This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced war fighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft bring to our nation and allies.","Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S.\/Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements.","Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear, multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense.","We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.","I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you two years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio content resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year, as the remaining business areas perform a significantly higher proportion of international work than did IS&GS.","International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes, and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world.","Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth, as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DOD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers.","We're expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy, and personnel to achieve this new higher level as we move forward.","I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter, the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value-creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DOD portfolio.","Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offer plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases, and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.","I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident that this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan on all key financial measures through the first three quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis.","During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.","Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS [Rotary and Mission Systems] for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year, with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE [Atomic Weapons Establishment] that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart.","Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was a $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next eight years.","Next, we moved the FAS\/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS into discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year.","In discontinued operations, we recognized the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as their 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These two items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year.","If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compared with the EPS from one year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS\/CAS adjustment, a lower tax rate, and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.","On chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015, and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35, LRIP 9, and LRIP 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year end, as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.","Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year to date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier.","On chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time. From our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned.","Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have three columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems.","We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving two views of cash from operations, one assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year end, and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook. And this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems, and Missiles and Fire Control.","If the F-35 collections slip into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the two years will not change, and we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.","Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we're increasing our sales outlook by $900 million, with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to the consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher than expected sales performance on the F-35 program.","Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for our segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites.","On chart 13 we provide our preliminary trend information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics's growth, driven by F-35 production and sustainment and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales.","RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems, as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year.","We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5%, with the reduction from the 2016 level driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA [United Launch Alliance] equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016, and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.","Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collections slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level.","Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS\/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS\/CAS projection we provided last quarter.","On the next two charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations, during the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017, significantly higher than prior years, as we were expecting what we call a pension funding holiday for that three-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collections slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year timeframe, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal.","If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also except to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019, with all years at or near $5 billion even after we begin to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019.","On chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS\/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer timeframe. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%.","As most of you know, we have a significant prefunding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our CAS billings to the government. At the end of 2016, we expect that prefund credit balance to be around $7 billion. And we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions.","And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a two-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the prefund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification of freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen.","Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS\/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service costs for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020, as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS\/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS\/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions.","That leads us to our summary on chart 16. We had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us to fund for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.","With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the LRIP negotiations. I'm sure there's not a lot of detail you can go into. But can you talk in general terms maybe about what the sticking points here are? I know it's gone on for many months longer than expected. Do you see, Bruce, any risk to the margin guidance you've given or maybe any upside to the margin guidance you've given based on how those negotiations pan out, or is that not really what's on the table now?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Let me just start with the negotiations. This is a very large contract. It's the largest contract to date on the program. So there's a lot of data, there's a lot of work that has to happen in those types of negotiations. And we are making progress and both parties want to get this contract right, so it takes time to do that. So I would say we continue to make progress on it. Bruce, do you want to cover the margin side?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. You asked what were the sticking points here. And I'll say they're the typical points that enter into every contractual negotiation. They revolve around what's the cost to perform the contract, what are the terms and conditions associated with that contract, and what's the profit level for the contractor for performing that contract. And I'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those three, but we're making progress every day towards that closure, so still hopeful we'll close soon.","I think the latter part of your question was were there risks to the margins, and you should think at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 have very little if anything to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So latter years obviously are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I ask a question on the capital deployment or cash deployment? I think, Marillyn, you said you're in a position to disposition the Leidos dividend through the end of the year. And I think, Bruce, you said you'd overachieve the share repurchase reduction by the end of this year. Just a clarification, how much do you intend to repo through the end of the year? And did, Bruce, you mean 291 million diluted share count at the end of the year or period end share count? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So good questions, Myles. On the capital deployment side, we're still looking at about $2 billion for the year. I think we've had a little bit of benefit. We still have \u2013 we haven't talked about it in a while. We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot sticker in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had plan levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected.","You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment. So we've spent most of that through the first three quarters. I want to say it's around 400-some-odd million dollars. I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September, and a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made. So our expectation is that we will have consumed the full $1.8 billion in capital allocations by the end of the year.","And I'm sorry, you asked one other question, Myles, about the 291 million shares. Was that an average or was that the point estimate at the end of the year? It is the year-end view as far as shares outstanding.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Bruce, the 7% total company revenue growth in 2017, can you tell us what that is organically? It looks like AWE is not apples to apples maybe by about 2%. Is that right, and is there anything else? And then I just wondered if you all could speak to your view of the sustainability of whatever that organic revenue growth rate is on a multiyear basis, in your view.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","I'll take a shot at that, Noah. So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if that's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion \u2013 $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change. So that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think the growth organically as you describe it from year over year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year.","Going forward for the next three years or so, we still believe \u2013 we talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the out years. We still feel good about that, although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think. So we have a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018, also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth \u2013 organic growth in 2018, it will be a little bit diminished because of those two events, but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those two events.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","There are a lot of questions out there about what happens after your pension funding holiday expires in 2018, so I thought a bit. I ask about slide 14. It shows some significant gains even when you resume your pension contributions. And what I wanted to know was have your pension contributions declined a lot? I had thought that you were talking about numbers north of $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion in 2018. So I thought maybe you'd comment on how you're able to generate the cash flows that you're discussing today in the slide.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","I'll take that one, Rich. So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as they toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up with a new goal, essentially the same as the old goal for a three-year period with a common 2017 in both of those three-year goals.","The amount of pension contributions, we have zero in 2017. For all intents and purposes, we have some minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, that's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth. And most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward, the Sikorsky business, which we've described as treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective. And then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs frankly that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation.","And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, sorry, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those three elements and then everyone else holding constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you maybe \u2013 I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions, and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so it's a 35% offset to what we see there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","One to Marillyn, I guess your comments on the 25% international. I can remember back when it was down in the low teens, and obviously you've had the benefit here of some of the portfolio shaping that boosted that. But I wanted to just get at my comment on the visibility around that. When you look at that number continuing to grow and with the goal of getting it out to 30%, how much \u2013 if we think about 2017 what's already in backlog or what you have to win when you look at that kind of percentage on the international just given the concerns about sometimes there's delays on those contracts?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks for the question, Peter. I would say the biggest growth area for us is the F-35. Certainly we've got a lot of international sales on the F-35, and so that will be the largest one. The second one is on missile defense. We've seen a lot of demand expanding for missile defense in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East as well as in Europe. So THAAD and Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot, MEADS. Last year our international sales were almost $9.6 billion. And so when you think about the backlog that we've also been building over time, it's around 30% of that. Thirty percent of our backlog is international today. So we've got a lot of quality booked business that will come in toward those international sales.","And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth. We continue to have a pull for not only missile defense but munitions and other things in the market, particularly in the Middle East. And we're seeing growing interest in things like helicopters in Poland and, as I mentioned earlier, the C-130J in markets that we hadn't been in before like France and Germany. So we expect that we'll continue to have a pull for international growth.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Welcome back, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone; Bruce, just a quick clarification question and then one for Marillyn. Clarification question, the international revenue streams that you see coming down the pike here, do you think that these will be margin accretive for you given the mix?","And then, Marillyn, can you just spend a few minutes on missile defense as it relates to international? Talk a little bit about the competitive environment, the partnering environment, and how you see this market developing over time. Which products are you going to be leading with, participating in? And does it really matter to you which products eventually come out on top from a competitive perspective?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Okay, Jason, I'll take the first one on what you describe as the international revenue stream, and I think the question was whether that was margin accretive or not. You should think of most of the \u2013 in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or Foreign Military Sales in nature, as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth, think of that on programs like the F-35 and the PAC-3 missile and the THAAD air missile defense system. Most of those are being negotiated. Even though they're FMS, most of are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs.","So I would not expect to see huge benefits margin-wise from the growth that we're seeing in the international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that that happens, that's usually at a higher margin than the FMS, but not hugely accretive would be my overall take.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So, Jason, on your questions around missile defense, the lay of the land relative to competition versus partnering and developing over time, if I could just walk through some of the products. From a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot system. So we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which is the extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability.","On THAAD, it's in the UAE today, of course. And there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East. Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at THAAD going forward. On Aegis, we just with Korea and Japan, they're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries I think moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland.","And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability, and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system is a new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS.","And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. And so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth in the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully that answers your question.","I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need we expect they'll continue to put in place. But the rest are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide or what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others, as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thank you, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I had a couple program questions. One is the F-16. It looked like maybe you guys got approval during the quarter for an incremental order. I thought maybe it was Bahrain. Is that not part of the current planning? I was just curious of your thoughts on that, and then also when you expect the Qatar THAAD order to actually be booked.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","I'll try that, Pete. So I think the Bahrain order, there's now at least consideration from a government-to-government discussion about the opportunity to make that an order. It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 line. So right now it's not in there. Longer term for the F-16 firm-up, as I had teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward.","Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end in the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program has not gone away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017, I said 2018, I think the line comes to an end in 2017 \u2013 excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have six aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year. and yet the sales on the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this yea. And in part that's because we have you should think of as three large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese, and a soon to be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year, so hopefully a little more color there.","THAAD Qatar, we had hoped to close that this year, looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more just about Sikorsky. The purchase accounting changes, does that affect anything on a go-forward basis in terms of the GAAP earnings or loss on a run rate, and if you can at all size the favorable adjustment that you called out in the third quarter?","And somewhat related is another helicopter manufacturer talked about seeing a bottoming on the commercial side of the business. I'm wondering if you've seen anything similar or what you're thinking about the commercial helicopter business now.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So let's see. On the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth moved around a little bit, in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done one year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter.","The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky. I'm thinking about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from 2016 to 2017, that was what was always in the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much.","You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to fill the backlog.","As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave on the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers would plan and suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Primarily on the oil and gas helicopters in that regard. We are looking for other opportunities for commercial helicopters, search and rescue, paramilitary, and things of that nature. But as Bruce said, the bulk of commercial helicopter sales in the past have been in the oil and gas, and so we look for recovery further out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you, two things. One is I've got to give Jerry a shout-out. I don't know whether you're going to be on the next call or not, but I think that's important.","Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Service, Inc.","It depends on how he does on this call, Jerry. It depends on how he does this call, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Or it depends on whether he likes \u2013 whether Marillyn likes my question or not, you know. But in all seriousness, in the past you've done a nice job of usually having risk reduction items that work in your favor. And if I tallied the numbers this quarter, outside of missiles and space, most of them went against you to the tune of around $150 million. Is there anything there that you can point to that's systematic, or is it just one-off items?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Howard, I'll take that one on. As we look at the third quarter adjustments, there were ins and outs across the business area, but it's actually very close to where we were at the third quarter of last year. Second quarter was quite a bit lighter. I think that's just the sequencing of milestone events. That's the sequencing of performance improvements, and they're just by their nature lumpy. But I don't think \u2013 I think you asked a question is it systemic or not. I don't think there's anything systemic, and that's not what's driving the marketplace going forward.","As we're going to end the year, next quarter and for this year in 2016, at least as we sit here today, it looks pretty similar to what we did from planned step-ups in the fourth quarter versus 2013. We may end the year a little bit light, just relative to historical level, so probably in the lower 30%. I think last year we did 34-ish or thereabout percent. But we could have some improvement in the fourth quarter as well. So we'll tell you where we actually ended up at the end of the call in January. But I don't think, back to your original question, there was anything systemic there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Bruce, I think you mentioned either last call or the one before that that this year would be the bottom for Aeronautics margins and you start to get some improvement next year. I'm wondering if that's still your view. And then given the moving pieces in 2018 with F-16 and C-5 coming down, do Aero margins come back down, or is that level in 2017 something you can grow off of?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So let me try to address that, Joe. I actually, obviously I did say that. You've got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. It's just amazing the growth that we are seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought or at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on.","So the margin at Aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that but maybe not all that is driven by the F-35 significant ramp up at again, what I always call the margin dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has a dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward into 2018, and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16, again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually again a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between 2018 and 2017. I think the margins stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Andrea, this is Jerry. I know we're coming up on the hour. But because our comments were long today, I want people in the queue to not think they have to turn off here in the next two minutes. I think we have the ability to go another 15 minutes. So if we could, just extend it a little bit.","Operator","Absolutely. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 a little bit more. Deliveries this quarter were less than last year's quarter, and actually year to date I think you're one behind. I was thinking, if you could, just comment on what that is causing that and what it will be in the fourth quarter.","And on that score, if I just look at your guidance, it implies over $5 billion of revenues in Aeronautics in the fourth quarter, which is usually a strong quarter, but the step up is much more than what we've seen in the past. So if you could discuss that.","And then last, if I look at the $300 million of higher F-35 sales you called out, profit only up $25 million, so an 8.3% implied margin. That's a little lower than what we've seen in the past, so maybe you could comment on that. Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","George, you got your money's worth there, good job. So F-35 deliveries, and I should remind you, this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries. But you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light, lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest. And this is primarily because, and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft.","And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are effective with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said, and we think we recover such that by the end of 2017, we're back on contractual schedule and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017. But that's the expectation right now.","The other thing you talked about was the F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That will be the highest quarter I think in the history of Aeronautics. But that's tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations.","And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements and I think you said eight-point-something percent profit, that's in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous to this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we were talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rates you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi there.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, Rob.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Bruce, I wanted to go back to Rich's question on the three-year goal back on slide 14. But if I understand it correctly, you're going into these next three years with the same cash flow goal, maybe a little higher, despite a $3 billion to $4 billion headwind from pension contributions, if we take 2018 and 2019 and add that together, if I heard that right. And so you talked about F-35 and Sikorsky providing some revenue and earnings growth as an offset. How much more is coming from CAS reimbursement? In other words, when we think about this, what is the underlying revenue increase, and how do the margins trend with that revenue?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","So first comment, Rob, is you did hear it right. That is what we said, and I think you got the math to all that correct. And honestly, that's an interesting question because actually the CAS recovery or the pension recovery associated with CAS is diminishing going forward. So again, we talked about 2015 to 2017 having a pension holiday. That means we're not going to make pension contributions, so a significant level of pension recovery because of that.","Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks. While we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire timeframe. And that's again essentially \u2013 not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of prefund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to come back at some point in the CAS billings that we had with the government. That's what sustains us over that time. Even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, good afternoon now.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Bruce, to follow up on that question and then another question, the CAS recovery, which I think in 2016 is $2 billion, I think you've said $2.3 billion in 2017 previously, what does that grow to out in by 2019?","And then my other question on Sikorsky performing better than I think your initial guidance for this year, I think you talked about intangibles coming down next year. I thought it was more around integration costs coming down. But if you could, just give us an idea of what operating profit out of Sikorsky or margins might look out of Sikorsky on an all-in basis next year. Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thank you, David. So on the CAS side, you've got the numbers right for both 2016 and 2017. And rather than give you a precise for 2018 and 2019, I would just say that CAS increases in 2018 over 2017, and it increases again in 2019 over 2018. You should think of those as several hundred millions of dollars levels between each year there. And that's again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time.","Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first three quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first two quarters of the year.","I think you also talked about the changes in intangible, and I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one, and there are definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments. As well as I think one of things that I've teed up in the January call is there was about $30 million or $40 million of severance costs left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That along with lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016 is what's driving the improvements that I talked about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello, good afternoon.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good afternoon.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On F-35, I wanted to go back to what you said before about performance being ahead of your expectations, and particularly around sustainment. I'm curious as to, first, why was it is surprise that sustainment was larger than you thought? And then second, when you look forward, how does this larger amount of sustainment work? How do you see that going forward? Does that change the way that you look at the margin trajectory for the F-35 over the next few years?","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Good questions, Doug. I'll take that one on. So the performance \u2013 you described it as performance, I would not necessarily characterize it as performance. It's just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why the surprise or why did it seem like a surprise, I think to a certain extent, this was a little bit \u2013 I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft.","And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level of \u2013 if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base day one when you start delivering the aircraft to that base and all of the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on the aircraft, you can just imagine all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward. And I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we've had in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned.","Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment, and they're negotiated concurrently with the aircraft burden. They're negotiated at about similar levels of profitability. So I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. I might remind you that over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again that will end eventually unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics ROS dilution from the F-35 program.","Operator","Thank you.

How much of that should we think is difference in booking rate under the new contract versus adjustments unrelated to volume that are different year over year? Thanks a lot.","Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Carter, for the question. So I teed up the $1.5 billion I think a while back. I gave a range today, as you no doubt picked up, from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. You should think of that as just asset returns compounding and whether or not we're probably getting a little leeway there as far as we've assumed 8% returns going forward. We've assumed about a 5% return on assets in 2017. The underperformance of the 8% has a compounding effect that says you have to have higher CAS contributions going forward, and that's simplistically the reason for the range we're giving today is simply the asset returns.","C-130, previous years we did have some pretty good size pickups or step-ups or risk retirements relative to the third quarter last year. But you're also seeing, as you described it, the lower booking rate on the newly negotiated multiyear contract that has an effect of having a lower profit rate than we've seen in the past years on the C-130 program.","Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Andrea, I think we're coming up on the extra end of the 15 minutes, maybe final comments here my Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.","Thanks, Jerry. As we conclude the call today, I'd like to end by reiterating that the corporation completed an excellent quarter, and we continue to build on our momentum. We have a robust backlog. And as we look at an increasing DOD budget, we're well positioned for top line growth and strong cash flows in the future.","Before we leave the call today, I also want to take a moment to recognize that this is Jerry's last earnings call before he retires at the end of this year. Jerry, thank you for everything that you've done for me and for the corporation. You're truly the consummate IR professional and you will be missed, as you've heard from some of your colleagues on the phone today. And let me at this time also welcome Greg Gardner, who is Jerry's successor. Most of you have known Greg for several years. Jerry and Greg will work over the next few months to ensure that there's a smooth transition.","So again, thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in January, when we will review our 2016 full-year results and provide our formal 2017 guidance. Andrea, that concludes the call for today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"13233":["Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 24, 2013  3:00 PM ET","","Executives","","Jerry F.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Jerry F. Kircher, III","Thank you, Karen, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I would remind you that statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause the actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.

Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And I hope you\u2019ve all had a good start to the New Year. Before I begin, I want to say that it\u2019s a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call and I look forward to working with you going forward. I hope you got a chance to review our press release outlining fourth quarter and full-year results. I am extraordinarily pleased and proud of our Lockheed Martin team.","We have continued to achieve strong program execution and focus in a challenging environment. These efforts enable the corporation to achieve exceptional operational and financial results in 2012. Let me begin with a brief summary of 2012. Strong order bookings in the fourth quarter resulted in our achieving a record annual level of almost $49 billion in new business awards from domestic and international customers.","Noteworthy awards included $4.4 billion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program for additional production activities, $2 billion for two additional spacecraft on the Advanced EHF Military Communications program for the Air Force and $800 million for additional Patriot-3 missile defense components for the U.S. government and Taiwan.","These new orders enabled us to finish 2012 with a record backlog of over $82 billion. Our backlog of work provides a solid foundation for the future and is a direct indicator of the close alignment of our portfolio products with customers\u2019 strategic priorities and requirements, even in today\u2019s demanding fiscal climate.","Other record performance levels for the corporation included growing our earnings per share from continuing operations to $8.36, the highest EPS level we have ever achieved increasing our segment operating profit to almost $5.6 billion, $300 million above the 2011 level. Expanding our segment operating margin to a record 11.8%, an increase of 40 basis points above the 2011 level, and growing our sales to over $47 billion, despite a challenging budget environment.","These achievements reflect our commitment to affordability as our team drives for increased efficiencies and improved execution for our customers. We also continue to implement our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we paid $373 million in dividend and repurchased $286 million in shares. These actions brought our full-year total for cash return to shareholders to $2.4 billion reflecting dividend payments of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $1 billion.","In addition to the cash returns in 2012, we generated 20% total shareholder return achieved by stock-price appreciation and dividend yield. These results reflect the quality of our work force, the strength of the corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their contributions in driving the strong achievements.","In addition to these results, we also continued our strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy, with the purchase of two businesses in the quarter. Both of these acquisitions expand our offerings in support of our customers increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our goal to maintain a portfolio of technology advanced options that will generate value for customers and shareholders.","The first acquisition was for Chandler\/May, a company that specializes in the design, manufacturing and support of unmanned aerial systems. The second acquisition was for CDL Systems, a software engineering firm that specializes in the development and licensing of vehicle control software for unmanned systems. These purchases following our acquisition early in 2012 of Procerus Technologies, and will be part of our mission systems and training business, where they will be integrated into our growing portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies.","Turning now to operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional skill and focus in providing critical products and services to customers. While the quarter contain numerous accomplishments across the enterprise, I\u2019d like to highlight two unprecedented successes in the ballistic missile defense test arena.","First, four of our five business areas provided equipment and support in the first ever integrated ballistic missile defense test of the Aegis, Patriot and THAAD systems. These systems work together to successfully detect, track and destroy multiple ballistic missile and cruise missile targets in a live fire test. This operational test was conducted by soldiers, sailors and airmen from multiple combatant commands and demonstrated the maturity and reliability of these essential missile defense systems.","It also demonstrated the benefits of layered, interoperable missile defense solutions that can provide protection to the U.S. and allies against the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles. With the proven reliability and capabilities of our Aegis, Patriot and THAAD systems, we look forward to growing domestic and international customer demand for missile defense systems.","The second significant ballistic missile defense event was achieved by our Medium Extended Air Defense or MEAD, successfully tracking and intercepting a target in its first ever intercept flight test. MEADs is a next-generation air and missile defense system that incorporates full parameter 360\u00b0 defense and provide eight times the coverage area of current legacy systems, while dramatically reducing operational and support cost. With this intercept demonstrating the maturity, next-generation capabilities and cost effectiveness of MEAD, we urge Congress to provide future funding for the program.","Moving to F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, our aeronautics team continued their momentum in this quarter through significant advances on the development program and achieving an increasing tempo on production programs.","On the development program, key achievements included accomplishment of test flights for the year that were 18% ahead of goal, and accomplishment of test points for the year that were 10% ahead of the goal. The aircraft also surpassed 5000 flight hours and achieved the first aerial weapons release for CTOL and STOVL aircraft and maximum high angle of attack fight on CTOL aircraft.","In addition to the test flight success, I had the pleasure to attend the official delivery ceremony of the first operational STOVL aircraft to Marine Corp Air Station in Yuma, Arizona in November. The ceremony marked the handover of the jets to the service and with the receipt of these aircraft, the base will start tactical operational training on this critical asset for the Marine Crop.","Also in the area of training, the 33rd fighter wing at Eglin Air Force Base completed the requirements allowing their wing to begin pilot training in 2013. These events in Arizona and Florida demonstrate the increasing tempo and maturity of the training programs, as we work to get these assets to the services.","Turning to production activities, we continue to make progress on our production tempo with delivery of 13 aircraft in the fourth quarter. This brought our full year deliveries to 30 aircraft more than double the aircraft deliveries achieved in 2011. Significant contractual progress was also achieved this quarter, with completion and negotiations on the LRIP 5 contract, awarded an undefinitized contract action LRIP 6 and long-lead for LRIP 7. These contracts provides significant stability to the program, as we work with our partners to provide these critical aircraft to domestic, and international customers. These latest contract awards bring our F-35 production backlog at year-end to 88 aircraft. Our maturing production lines, operational base stand up and expanded pilot training are all strong indicators of the F-35 programs positive trajectory.","Beyond the operational program accomplishments we continue to take additional actions to drive affordability across the corporations, and to increase customer alignment. Along with the perviously announced reorganization of our electronics systems business area and to two new business areas, Missiles and Fire Control's and Mission Systems & Training, effective December 31, 2012. We also announced consolidation of several corporate functions at our headquarters designed to streamline and tighten the corporate staff.","These actions will improve collaboration and coordination across the enterprise, increase efficiency and achieve greater synergy. It will also focus us on the actions that best position the company for success and growth in a demanding and dynamic environment.","I would like to turn now to the status of DoD budgets, and the continuing levels of uncertainty for fiscal year \u201813 and beyond funding levels. Currently the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through at least March 27, for FY 2013 with funding constraint to prior FY 2012 levels. This limitation will cause funds to run short in some accounts and we\u2019ll continue last year\u2019s dated priorities that don\u2019t necessarily reflect the new defense strategy, because of this, and other limitations associated with the full-year CR, we are strongly urging Congress to pass the defense appropriations bill in March and not extend the CR for the remainder of the year.","The second area, budget uncertainty is associated with the pending threat of sequestration or automatic budget cut. Since our October call, some encouraging action was undertaken by Congress and the White House to avoid implementation of these across the board budget reductions. In early January, the President timed the generation, the deferred implementation of approximately $1.2 trillion in automatic federal budget reductions for two months until March 1. However, if sequestration is allowed to happen on March 1, it\u2019s still result in cuts of $0.5 trillion each in defense and non-defense accounts over nine years.","For defense, that\u2019s an additional $0.5 trillion in cuts beyond the $487 billion already imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, while we recognized the both parties are strongly imposed to allowing sequestration to happen. We remain deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default outcome, if negotiations failed to produce an agreement.","As the Joint Chiefs of Staff just explained in a powerful January 14 letter, sequestration is not only puts a risk our defense industrial base, it also forms military readiness, and would quickly hollow out our military forces. In the weeks ahead, we\u2019ll continue to work with our government leaders to encourage a more effective solution to our nation\u2019s fiscal challenges.","Despite the continuing uncertainty on U.S. defense budget, it is absolutely clear that there is a growing need for security solutions in a challenging global landscape. Events this past quarter, such as the successful North Korean multistage missile launch, coupled with the continued rise in China\u2019s military strength, ongoing instability in the Middle East, and the expansion of terrorist activity in Africa, only highlight the complexity and volatility embedded in the mission of maintaining global security.","Our portfolio of products and capabilities remain in direct alignment with this global security mission, and we look forward to help in domestic and international customers, secure solutions to their most critical defense and security requirements. While no one can precisely predict the impacts of sequestration, where events that will unfold in the global security environment, there is one thing I know for certain, every one of our 120,000 employees stands ready to take on, whatever challenges emerge.","Focusing internally, I want to reiterate the priorities that I have reinforced with the team since assuming my new role as CEO. These priorities are consistent and unchanged from those that I helped to formulate as the member of the Executive Office, and working with Bob Stevens in my prior role. I thought it useful to outline those priorities on the call today.","My direction to our team is to grow the business with key drivers being fighter fleet recapitalization from the F-35, missile defense in Aegis, THAAD and Patriot, cargo aircraft fleet expansion with C-5M and C-130J, littoral combat ships, fleet expansion and C4ISR, achieve higher levels of program performance, and execution excellence to satisfy customer requirements, and provide financial returns to shareholders, pursue a strategy to secure and expand our core business, and expand and to closely align adjacent markets such as cyber security, grow international revenues to at least 20% of total corporate assets in the next few years. Continue to return at least 50% of annual free cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Invest for growth, through renovation, product evolution, and strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy.","Finally, and importantly, continue our strong focus on talent development and employee engagement. I believe achievement of these priorities will enable our corporation to continue to provide superior performance to our customers and shareholders as we move forward.","Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and detail on our performance, I want to highlight two organizational changes approved by our Board yesterday. First, Joanne Maguire, Executive Vice President of our Space Systems business advised of her plan to retire from our company after a distinguished career. Since taking over the leadership role in Space Systems in 2006, she has grown the business, while streamlining the cost structure for our customers and expanding returns to shareholders. Under her leadership and drive for innovation, Space Systems achieved a remarkable track record of mission success and continues to provide broader array of advanced technology systems for national security, civil and commercial customers. Effective April 1, Rick Ambrose will assume responsibility as Executive Vice President of our Space Systems business replacing Joanne.","Rick brings over 33 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry, and has currently been serving as Vice President and Deputy for Space Systems reporting to Joanne. Rick's vivid background within System Systems, leading our intelligence business in IS&GS, and his leadership roles in our former Mission Systems and Sensors business will be extremely valuable experience, as we move the space business forward for our customers and employees.","Secondly, Linda Gooden, Executive Vice President of Information Systems & Global Solutions has also advised of her plan to retire after more than 32 years with corporation. Linda assumed the leadership role at IS&GS in 2007, and has managed over 30,000 professionals, who provide integrated, information technology solutions, systems and support for worldwide missions to civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. Her customer knowledge and leadership have been key catalyst enabling IS&GS to maintain its leading position as the largest IT provider to the U.S. government for the past 18 years. Effective April 1, Sondra Barbour will assume responsibility as Executive Vice President of IS&GS replacing Linda.","Sondra is currently serving as our Senior Vice President, Enterprise Business Services and Chief Information Officer, for the Corporation. As CIO, Sondra is responsible for leading our internal IT operations including the protection of ours and our customers infrastructure and information from cyber threats. She was also instrumental in defining and launching our new government and commercial cyber security business. Sondra\u2019s knowledge of IT systems coupled with 20 years experience in IS&GS, where she served in program management and as CIO and Vice President of Operations, demonstrated her strong leadership and track record that have prepared her well for her new role to lead IS&GS.","Both Joanne and Linda have had exceptional carriers and are exceptional executives in every respect through their dedication and professionalism; I really want to thank them for their leadership and service to corporation over their carriers, these retirements and their succession by proven leaders highlight, why we\u2019ve invested so much energy and time in our talent management and leadership development programs.","Our succession planning process is vitally important to the future of the corporation and provides the outstanding cadre of highly qualified executives ready to assume additional responsibility, and take our business forward. Both Rick and Sondra represent the depth and breadth of talent in our company and bring proven leadership track records. Each has decades of experience gained by working in diversified assignments. They are leaders who have built superb teams in prior assignments, and I look forward to their ongoing contributions as they assume their new role.","I will now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our performance, and then we\u2019ll open up the line for questions. Bruce?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks Marillyn and good afternoon everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s start with chart three; an overview of the year. We grew sales for the year to $47.2 billion, exceeding the guidance that we provided in October. I\u2019ll discuss sales in greater detail in the next few charts.","We increased our segment operating margins to 11.8% or 40 basis points higher than our 2011 margin. Our earnings per share were $8.36; we generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations after making $3.6 billion of pension contributions. I\u2019ll explain the reasons for the additional contribution amount in subsequent charts.","And our backlog finished very strong, at over $82 billion. We had said throughout 2012 that we expect the backlog to end the year at about the same level as we began, but this obviously exceeded our expectations.","Chart four, shows our sales trend for the past four years, $47.2 billion represents the highest level of sales in our history, and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve been able to grow about 8%, since 2009 a period with significant economic and budgetary pressures.","Moving to chart five, and looking at our new alignment of five business areas, three of our five business areas grew sales during the year including MST, aeronautics, and space while missiles and fire control sales were comparable to 2011. As expected, IS&GS showed a reduction in sales versus 2011, reflecting both the overall decline in the federal IT budget, and the effects of the continuing resolution in the fourth quarter.","Turning to chart six, in segment operating results, we grew consolidated segment operating profit by over $300 million, with one quarter of the growth due to the higher sales volume mentioned previously. The remaining increase results from the 40 basis point margin improvement to 11.8%, reflecting the strong performance and proactive cost measures taken during the year.","So turn to chart seven, you see each of the business areas margins in 2012 compared with 2011. Three of our five business areas improve margins in the year including aeronautics, MST and missiles and fire control. And space was comparable with the prior year reflecting the breadth of our execution and cost improvement actions.","On chart eight, we will discuss the earnings per share for the year. We grew EPS by more than 6% over the 2011 amount, and this represents the first time, we\u2019ve exceeded the $8 per share level. Our pension adjusted EPS grew to just below $10 per share.","On chart nine, we will reconcile our actual 2012 EPS versus our last guidance range. In October we gave our EPS guidance as $8.20 to $8.40 resulting in a midpoint of $8.30 per share. Our fourth quarter results yielded $150 million more in segment operating profits than was contemplated in the EPS midpoint resulting in a $0.31 improvement. We had other items that reduced EPS by $0.25 including a non-operational tax item worth $0.18 and special item in the quarter related to headcount reductions in our aeronautics business that was worth $0.05. Overall the fourth quarter changes netted to the $0.06 increase over our October mid point guidance.","The non-operational tax item was due to our $2.5 billion discretionary pension contribution in the fourth quarter which caused our taxable income to be lower than the level planned in the first three quarters of the year. This required a true up in the fourth quarter reducing the manufacturing deduction for the year and lowering EPS by $0.18. Future year\u2019s taxable income will be higher as a result of the accelerated pension contributions end of 2012 and we expect to capture most of the reduced manufacturing deduction over the next two years.","We\u2019ve [weighed] [ph] the contributions for several reasons. First, with the possibility of Corporate Tax Reform, this contribution locks in our pension deduction at the current statutory rate of 35% and should the rate be reduced to 25% as has been discussed, this benefit will be worth $250 million. Second, earlier contributions to our pension plans allow the assets to grow quicker also lowering future required contributions.","Next we have the cash on hand to make the contributions which otherwise would yield minimal interest income and finally the acceleration into 2012 increases operating cash in the future providing a fairly quick payback and a very low interest-rate environment.","Chart 10, shows our operating cash results prior to the discretionary pension contribution. Our guidance in October was that our cash from operations will be greater than or equal to $4 billion prior to the pension contribution, our cash from operations was $4.1 billion, slightly higher than expected.","On chart 11, we\u2019ll discuss our backlog trends for the past few years. We\u2019ve grown our backlog since 2009 by $5 billion more than our sales growth over the same time frame. And the $82.3 billion at year end 2012 represents our highest ever backlog level. As you can see our book-to-bill ratio has exceeded 1.0 in each of the last three years.","Chart 12, provides the assumption embedded in our 2013 guidance, importantly our guidance for the year assumes a continuum resolution through the current date of March 27 and it does not assume the sequestration reductions are implemented. Our fast cash pension adjustment of $485 million is based on a 4% discount rate, and long-term asset return of 8%, consistent with our assumptions in October. And our planned contribution level in 2013, is $1.5 billion equal to the level of cash recovery in the year.","The expected earnings from the $2.5 billion pension contribution reduces our 2013 FAS expense by $200 million at the assumed 8% return levels. 2013, will include both the 2012 and 2013 benefit of the R&D tax credit legislation passed earlier this year. As a result of that legislation being passed in January, the 2012 benefit will be recognized entirely in the first quarter, as well one quarter of the 2013 credits. We expect this benefit to amount to $45 million in the quarter, and approximately $75 million for the year.","Finally our share count remains flat, with share repurchases offsetting the effects of option exercises and new issuances.","Chart 13, provides our new outlook for 2013, our sales for the year are consistent with our expectations when we last spoke in October, despite the significant increase in fourth quarter 2012 sales. Segment operating profit and the resulting margin are both higher than we indicated in October with the expectation that our strong performance in 2012 will carry over into 2013.","EPS from continuing operations are expected to be between $8.80 and $9.10 for the year and cash from operations are expected to be greater than or equal to $4 billion. As prevailing in the year, we would expect sequential growth in our sales during the year with the first quarter being markedly lower than the next three quarters and about $1 million lower than the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower aircraft qualities in our aeronautics business.","In the first quarter, we expect to have 10 fewer F-16s, six fewer C-130s, low C-5 deliveries and lower F-22 volume as there were production deliveries in the first quarter last year, and there are none this year. Margins are expected to be fairly consistent back order in the mid 11% range that could obviously change depending on the timing of risk retirements.","Cash would be strong in the first quarter with a benefit of the large tax refund as a result of the discretionary pension contribution and backlog will likely drop in the first quarter and first half of the year as orders are expected to be more heavily loaded in the second half of the year.","Chart 14, shows the guidance ranges for sales and segment operating profit by our business areas. Note that the reorganization of our former electronic systems business results in two nearly equally sized business areas in Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training.","And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 15. 2012 was a strong year for us both operationally and financially. These results reflect the strong performance and proactive steps, we\u2019ve been taking for several years and our challenges to continue that success into the future.","Our backlog is positioned just well and speaks to the alignment of our portfolio with the needs of our customers, and require the 20% total return we provided our shareholders in 2012 and we stand ready to perform in 2013. With that we are ready for your questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Good afternoon everyone.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Yeah, welcome Marillyn. Bruce, I wanted to target this question to you and talk a little bit about cash deployment. I think this big pension contribution that we made here during the quarter may have caught a few of us by surprise. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about whether you contemplated kind of letting us know that this was going to be coming perhaps why you didn't? And then also maybe just talk a little bit about long-term capital deployment and what you see on the horizon with regard to the mix, we just now had a big pension contribution, does that take that off the table now for a number of years and we get a much more steady stream of operating cash flow that can be used to deploy either back into the business or back into shareholders through repurchases and dividends.","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks Jason. I think you got your money worth on that question. So let's see where do I start, as to why we did it at the end of the year and why we didn't tell you, and did we contemplate telling you. We did a fairly comprehensive study as far as pension analyses are concerned relative to our funding requirements, the expectations in the future, the sensitivity of our plans through asset returns, discount rate changes and the like. You may or may not be aware, we actually sent out in the fourth quarter an offering to our terminated but vested participants in the plan offering to essentially give them lump sum payments in lieu of the pension payments over periods of time when they retired. We got a fairly good return on that, actually reducing some of the volatility and our liability associated with those individuals going forward.","We were studying this issue right up until literally the end of the fourth quarter, Jason. And we were studying at the same time the prospects of what was going on in Washington relative to corporate tax reform and we were speaking to the Board at that time saying we think this might be sort of the confluence of a lot of different actions that should result in us potentially making a larger contribution for the pension plan in 2012 in order to, in my words lock-in the deduction at 35%. We do feel there\u2019s a strong possibility for corporate tax reform going forward. We think that number could be anywhere from a 25% to 28% rate as opposed to the current 35% and we very much wanted to, as I said earlier lock in that rate. I walked through the very dynamics that I said in the prepared remarks relative to we thinking that this is a very quick payback, and the interest that we\u2019re earning on the cash on the balance sheet is probably about 20 basis points as we sit here today.","So if the acceleration occurs and within a low interest rate period of time and we\u2019re getting low interest on the cash that sits on the balance sheet, currently, it did accelerate the tax deduction as we talked about earlier and I liked the fact that it also reduces the gap between pension adjusted and reported earnings, as I mentioned earlier as well.","Now, we look at this Jason, and now this, I'll give you some stats here. So taking a look at 2013, one of the reasons we did it, the $2.5 billion as we looked at how much cash did we want to have left on the balance sheet and how much flexibility did we want to have going into 2013 to enable us to do the sorts of cash deployment activities we\u2019ve done in years past.","So in 2013, we're looking at $4 billion of operating cash. We're looking at roughly $1 billion or so of capital expenditure. So $3 billion of free cash flow. We do have about $150 million debt retirement that we were going to do in 2013. So think of that as contributing $850 million sort of unencumbered, of our free cash flow and we felt that that $850 million plus the $1.9 billion on the balance sheet so almost $2.8 billion was very adequate to continue to do the kind of cash deployment that we have done in the past.","I think a fair question would be, so you guys have said, you\u2019re not going to have a share count increase, what's that level of share repurchase that you\u2019re counting on there and at least for our planning purposes we're expecting about $700 million of share repurchase activity in order to affect that and that's our estimate of how many options will be exercised in a year and also how many new issuances of stock will occur for executive compensation matching of our retirement plans in the like.","So collectively, we think from a cash deployment -between the current dividend contributions that we'll have in 2013 or roughly $1.5 billion plus the $700 million of share repurchase embedded in our guidance, that\u2019s $2.2 billion.","As I said, I think we still have adequate flexibility on the balance sheet, and unencumbered cash flow to remain opportunistic to do additional share repurchases or mergers and our acquisition candidates, if in fact they looked fine for us to make those acquisitions.","I think the other side of it is, we don\u2019t see this as a change and I think Marillyn made those comments in her prepared remarks relative to our long standing cash deployment practice of contributing at least 50% of more of free cash flow to our shareholders and that is still our intent, and I think I said it earlier, but I\u2019ll close again, the reason for the timing was we literally didn\u2019t have this discussion until late in December with our Board of Directors before making this contribution.","So kind of long winded answer, Jason, sorry about that?","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.","Richard Safran \u2013 Buckingham Research","","Hi, good afternoon.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Rich.","Richard Safran \u2013 Buckingham Research","","I have a question of IS&GS, you\u2019re guiding to 9% margins for the year, given the margin pressure in this environment right now, can you discuss a little bit about what gives you the ability and confidence you can sustain 9% margins and also maybe if you could comment if this is being driven by you cyber and intelligence business.","Bruce L. Tanner","","Hey, thanks Richard. I\u2019ll take that one as well. So if we look at IS&GS, I think we made a very conscious decision and I discussed this on previous calls, we try to differentiate ourselves somewhat in this market, by focusing on what I\u2019ll call mission IT, where we\u2019re literally sort of providing the embedded capabilities in large measure for our customers as opposed to what I\u2019ll call commodity IT, and you think about that as sort of back shop processing and the like, helpdesks, those sort of things, where we really didn't see, we have done that work in the past, but really we didn't see sort of a discriminator or differentiator for Lockheed Martin in doing that work.","So we focused much more on the mission part of the IT service that tends to be a higher margin part of the service activity in the IT world. So that's one thing that gives me the confidence that we continue to do that. ","And as I look back Rich, over the last probably eight or nine quarters, IS&GS has been nine or the low 9% return on sales consecutively for those eight or nine quarters. So that gives me confidence again going into 2013, and we continue to do that. You asked about the cyber, we are very excited about the cyber activity within IS&GS. We've had some very successful wins including taking some business away from some of our competitors within cyber. I believe we are the largest federal cyber provider in the industry. And that work is very valued, that's very much in line with that mission IT that I talked about, and that work as you would suspect supports that 9% margin as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Doug S. Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","Good afternoon.","","Bruce L. Tanner","","Hi Doug.","","Doug S. Harned \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","I\u2019d like to follow-on Jason's question about cash deployment. If I look at the last few years, particularly 2010 and 2011, and if you look at, what I will call the cash yield to shareholders the net repurchase of shares, plus the dividends you've been above 10%. And I think a lot of people found that very attractive. Today when you\u2019re looking forward for this year, we\u2019re basically at 5%, if you assume no net share repurchases, and about 5% dividend yield. When you look out to 2014, 2015, how do you think about that, do you think about it in terms of, what yield the shareholders would be, is this a temporary period, we are handling a pension issue. And then you may go up to, I would call larger yields to shareholders in the future. How do you look at this?","Bruce L. Tanner","Doug, I\u2019ll try that one as well, I\u2019ll speak for myself, and I think I speak for the Board. We don\u2019t go about selecting share repurchase amounts from what additive to our dividend levels would get us to a certain level of return on our shares or a certain level of return on our market cap if you will. And that is just not the way we think about that. We very much look at this as opportunistic. we\u2019ve increased obviously the share, the dividend amounts considerably over the past few years to where that in and of itself essentially takes care of the 50% or more of free cash flow without any contribution of share repurchases.","I think if you look at where our pension plan is sitting from a funding perspective. To me, it\u2019s fairly obvious that you\u2019d want to help that pension plan get a higher level of funding, that\u2019s definitely a near-term use of cash than maybe it was a few years ago, with the rates going down. I\u2019ll tell you that was very much part of the study that I mentioned on discussion with Jason as to, what is the appropriate amount to contribute to the pension versus the real life possibility that interest rates increase, and actually get us into an over-funded situation, but we are certainly not abandoning our share repurchase strategy, we want to remain optimistic, that\u2019s the reason I try to give the color on the fact that we have lots of flexibility, not just this year, but you asked about 2014 and 2015, with growing cash, as I expect to happen over the next two years, I think we\u2019ll have even greater flexibility in \u201914, and \u201915 than we do in 2013.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee.","Peter J. Arment \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Marillyn. Question Bruce, I guess on the backlog, what\u2019s been impressive over the last few years, with the defense pressure has been the, your ability to kind of grow the backlog. Can you talk a little bit about, how the backup looks for \u201913, and what you need to see in terms of bookings in the second half of this year for international activity, to kind of hold these levels, just given what we\u2019re going to see with sequestration kicking in? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner","","Yes, let me give you sort of maybe a wide all-encompassing orders and backlog response to the question, Peter. So expectation wise, if I take a look at where we expect the orders for the year to end, and where we are right now from a backlog perspective, I think we\u2019ll end the year close to the $80 billion level, we might not be able to replicate the $82 billion that\u2019s the highest level we ever have done, but I feel pretty good about being able to get to the $80 billion or so. This will be an interesting year; you\u2019ve seen some of the correspondences come out of the acquisition community relative to delaying some of the near term awards associated with continuing resolution and anticipation of sequestration.","So we are definitely expecting to have a significantly more loaded second half of the year than in the first half.","So, I would expect each of the first two quarters to be below a 1.0 book to bill, I\u2019d expect the next two to be above 1.0 book-to-bill. I\u2019ll say we have a significant amount of international activity that we\u2019re counting on the year. I\u2019ll just rattle off a few of the orders that I think are important both from a dollar perspective and maybe a strategic perspective. And I\u2019ll ask Marillyn maybe to comment on some of the strategic ones as well. But we got sort of near-term \u2013 think of these as first half, I hate to give quarters only because of some of the delays that have occurred. But first half, we got the two LCS ships for the FY13 order. We got closure for the lot six international aircraft for five aircraft. We\u2019re hoping and our customer is hoping to definitize the lot 6 and lot 7 for F-35 negotiations in the first half of the year.","I think an important one that I think is worth mentioning is we expect to get long lead funding for lot 8 of the F-35 program for some 48 aircrafts. Just the quantity alone versus the prior year\u2019s quantity is worth mentioning. Think of that as 29 domestic aircrafts and 19 international aircraft including 9 FMS, for military sales, outside of the eight initial partners on the country (inaudible), excuse me.","Strategically there is some things to watch that aren\u2019t necessarily big dollar events, but they are strategically important to us. So the Aegis Combat System\u2019s engineering contract, within our MST operations, think of this as next generation Aegis development for the capabilities there.","The KC-46 training and the interesting thing about that is we\u2019re actually -  the only reason we\u2019re able to bid that frankly is because of the acquisition of the Sim-Industries last year, that gives us some capabilities to do that training capability on the 767 aircraft is the basis of the KC-46.","We have the Air and Missile Defense Radar which is sort of the next generation air and missile defense as the name implies, radar for surface combatants. Second half of the year we have a couple of vehicles 5 and 6 for the SBIRS contract, some THAAD UAE follow on production Lot 5 contract for the THAAD order, and some orders they tend to get on the common annual basis, the Fleet Ballistic Missile and next order the RERP, somewhere that mix internationally, we\u2019ve got the C-130 to Saudi as well. We\u2019ve got an Iraqi F-16 order, for another batch of 18 aircraft, we\u2019re hopeful for, and scattered throughout that are other smaller international business, I should point out that in the year 2012, we did about 17% sales, and about 17% of orders on international basis, and that\u2019s roughly what we\u2019re expecting in 2013, maybe little bit higher that the orders as far as the total content of our orders in 2013.","Marillyn A. Hewson","","So let me just add to that, we do have a strong focus on international growth in our growth portfolio, and as Bruce has listed out several items, but certainly there\u2019s continued strong demand for Air and Missile defense in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, and so we expect to continue to see a pull for PAC-3, THAAD, Aegis and in addition to that air mobility, F-16 as Bruce, he listed off, several of those things that are out there, that we\u2019re looking at, but we expect to grow our portfolio in the international side to at least 20% of our revenue in the next few years.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton, from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Thanks, good morning \u2013 sorry good afternoon by now, first one is a clarification, Bruce is the $1.5 million in 2013, discretionary or required, I would be surprised if required give me a brief on that?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yeah. That\u2019s our plan levels. Myles, I think the required amount is less than that.","Myles A. Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. And you mentioned the lot 8 quantities 19 international; I guess nine of those being able to mess Japan or Israel or combination of the two. And then 10 partners from a partner perspective, it\u2019s obviously good growth overall, but it seems like the partners are certainly flipping out to the right versus where they would have been 12 months ago in lot 8. Is there upward mobility to the lot 8 or is that kind of what the international partners will look like, I guess about 12 months ago, I would have thought, maybe that number would have been 30, now it sounds like it\u2019s 10, and what does that bode for the next couple halves thereafter?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yeah. I\u2019m trying to think of the 30 Myles. I can\u2019t imagine the scenario that would have gotten us to 30 aircraft. I think perhaps the number that you were thinking that might have been a little bit higher was, the Turkish aircraft in lot 8. They are now pushed out to the right. I think if we actually go back a couple of years, you would have seen fewer Israelian, Japanese aircraft, and so it\u2019s actually helped to mitigate some of those Turkish aircraft at least in lot 8, but that\u2019s you asked about the flexibility, I wouldn\u2019t think we would see the orders bouncing around much if any from that level, customers I will say yes, we have ongoing conversations with our customers, and they continue to like at the F-35 as we continue to perform. And I think that\u2019s the more we can do and demonstrate the capabilities of the aircraft and show that capability to customers like South Korea for instance, the more of this aircraft will stay on the future.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Then I think as I talked about earlier in my remarks we've made great progress on the program, it's maturing and the development process as well as the production ramping up. We've got 5,000 hours on the aircraft. We are committed to delivering an affordable aircraft and we are on plan, actually we're being ahead of plan to 2010 baseline that was put in place.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JP Morgan.","Joseph B. Nadol III \u2013 JP Morgan Securities","","Thanks good afternoon.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Joe.","Joseph B. Nadol III \u2013 JP Morgan Securities","This has been a very smooth transition thus far in terms of leadership Marillyn. But when I look at the either 2011 annual report in front of me, and there are nine folks in the picture. One of them is in his current seat and that is the person next to you, Bruce, everyone else has changed. So my question is in that context you have a very smooth transition, all the plants are the same, but the combination of these people here must have very different ideas in how to do things including you. So I am wondering if you could list a top two or three, may be that on top of your head in terms of how we think about the company, what might change?","Marillyn A. Hewson","","Well, we are all connected. This is a very tight team, this leadership team and that is why our succession plan has been so smooth and successful. We have been operating to the same strategy for a number of years and the results demonstrate the strategy is working. We have very experienced team of folks and so even though ones that are moving into the new roles have been with Corporation for a number of years. They are all experienced executives, and we spent a lot of time working together on making sure everyone does understand our strategy. So we in fact in another week will have the entire leadership team from across the Corporation together to talk about our strategy for the coming year to build on that, so we don\u2019t work together for a long time, and we\u2019re not in the mood of changing the strategy that we have, but our Board of Directors are directly involved in talent development and the succession training process. In fact, as Joanne and Linda announced their intent to retire, we took that to the Board, we reflected back on our pipeline of talent with them, and there was not even a hesitation on who would move into the next role. So we\u2019ve been calling together with tight leadership team for a number of years and it\u2019s a well planned transition process, and I don\u2019t expect there to be changes. We\u2019ll work together and deal with the environment they\u2019re operating in and adapt to it.","Operator","Thank you. and our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Thank you very much. I just want to follow-up a little bit on sort of change in the environment that you see going forward, and how you want to take advantage of that, Marillyn. In one case, you have Congress doing things like ring-fencing on EADS and in other cases; you have what I call low-cost competitors trying to unseat a very reliable solution in ULA. how do you deal with those two competitive threats?","Marillyn A. Hewson","","Any competitive threats we\u2019ve taken to account the environment that we\u2019re operating in, I think we have a very strong portfolio, and even me, I think is demonstrating success, the flight test that we had in November and the flight test we have planned through this year, later this year. We\u2019re going to operate to our technologies and our innovation that we bring to the marketplace is the hallmark of this corporation. and we are very much proactively focused on cost efficiencies and that\u2019s a critical discriminator for Israel.","So this competition that we are dealing with it\u2019s really not new to us at all. We are used to it. It's constant. That's how we operate all the time. It is in a competitive environment and we will continue to do so. So I don't find that has something that is a big change for us. We understand our competition, we understand the market that we are operating in and we're going to excel in these markets.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro research","Good afternoon.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, George.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro research","I'd like you to go through a little bit more detail some of the moving parts in aeronautics, something like one of the things that's in the release, that the operating profit is about comparable to \u201811 for the F-35 and the F-22. So the F-22 is down considerably from last year. F-35 is probably grown. So can you discuss kind of how much growth we saw in the F-35, where you are? If we change they made a booking rate and the margins et cetera.","Bruce L. Tanner","George, are you talking 2012 or are you talking to 2013?","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro research","I was just reading from the release in terms of your analysis that the operating profit for the December quarter, there is a comment in there that operating profit was comparable to the same period in \u201911 for F-35 contracts and the F-22, and sales were comparable as well which says that the I would imply the F-35 profit must have gone up, because you were booking lower on the F-35 than you were on the F-22, we know the F-22 revenues are way down. Looking for some more clarity.","Bruce L. Tanner","I think in the press release, I don't have it in front of me George. But I think what they are saying is that F-35 sales and F-35 profit this quarter are comparable to that F-35 sales and F-35 profit levels last year whereas F-22 sales and profit are comparable to last year\u2019s quarter as well, not that the two of them are comparable to each other if you follow.","Bruce L. Tanner","(Inaudible) we\u2019re coming on the hour, but because we have a number of people from the queue are sort of extended the comments today. We\u2019d like to go ahead and extend the call at least another 15 minutes to 4:15 or so to let people ask questions.","Operator","Certainly, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good afternoon and welcome, Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thank you.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just wanted to ask quickly about the F-35, the commentary from your customer last quarter before you sent the contract was that you were pretty fall apart on terms, yet you closed that negotiation before the end of the year and I wondered if you might comment on how you reached a conclusion there and what the implications are for the follow-on negotiations from your prospective, as Bruce highlighted that there\u2019s several up to follow-on lot negotiations that are sitting in front of you this year. any color would be much appreciated?","Marillyn A. Hewson","Sure. Carter, well, basically on the F-35, there were five negotiations what was important was for both sides to understand the cost structure of their positions. and so we had an opportunity to spend time with our customer, and let them share with us how they viewed all of the cost elements, we had an opportunity to likewise share that with them. and I think through that process we were able to come to a mutual understanding, and get to a closer negotiation and we reached a fair and yet challenging agreement. and so it wasn\u2019t \u2013 I think it did take a little longer, because we had a lot of time that we had to go through to, from both sides to really assess it, but it was nothing around the terms and conditions that drove that, it was really around the costs.","So I think we\u2019re in a good posture for lot 6 and 7, we already have the undefinitized contract action, and they\u2019re under contract, and we are in direct discussions right now at the program level on the lot 6 and 7 and the intend is to negotiate both of them together and get that done in the first half of the year, and our customers really need us going forward and make sure that we meet the challenges, but they put in front of us and that we\u2019re taking cost out. So in addition to getting our prime negotiated and getting on with our 6 and 7, we are working very hard on taking costs out of our business and driving toward a more affordable product for them in all aspects of our business.","Operator","Thank you. and our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon.","Bruce L. Tanner","Hi, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","A question for Bruce and this is building on George\u2019s question on the aeronautics, but I would like to take you up on the 2013 part of that, and may I ask if you could refresh us on the manifest by program, your quantities, the margin you see for the major programs, and in particular, if you could talk, just update us on the F-35 on the 36 aircraft, how we just think about, which lots those are from and profitability on F-35 in \u201813 relative to \u201812?","Bruce L. Tanner","Rob, you asked the question to me. so I\u2019ll answer it. So as we look at 2013, I think I said in the October call, we\u2019re going to be down probably 10, C-130 aircraft, so think of that \u2013 we did, I believe 34 in 2012 and other 24 or so in 2013. The F-16s, 37 last year, about 13 this year, think of that has really no change in aircraft deliveries from the four more flying. All the change we\u2019re talking about there was the aircraft that were delivered on to Turkish lines, so you will see sort of cost fluctuations, associated with that with the aircraft coming off the line in full order.","C-5 we\u2019ve talked, we really talked in the October call about the increased volume there. So we ended up delivering four, we actually delivered maybe an extra that we work exactly counting on delivering in 2012, but we ended up with four for the year. We\u2019re expecting somewhere around eight, so kind of a doubling of quantities on the C-5 program next year. And you talked about the F-35 deliveries, we\u2019re looking at probably a 20% increase. We did 30 this year, we\u2019re looking at 36 next year. (Inaudible) aircraft, those were I believe I will make it just a little bit off, I believe those were the tail-end. We started delivering lot 4, aircraft at the end of 2012. We\u2019ll deliver all remaining lot 4 aircraft in 2013, and then we\u2019ll start, and I\u2019ve lost track exactly. We\u2019re out somewhere in the middle of the year, third quarter-ish time of the year, we\u2019ll start delivering lot 5 aircraft, and those will be the aircraft that we deliver all the way through the end of the year.","Margins, on the F-35 program. We are expecting to go up in 2013. Therefore no other reason than the absence of the profit adjustment we took, I believe in the second quarter on the SCD contract to lower the expectations on the award fee going forward. But we\u2019re also, because we did have success, I\u2019ll remind you we started 2012 for the goal of delivering 30 aircraft, we had multiple strike at our four more facility, and we still delivered 30 aircraft, and so as you\u2019d like to imagine that says the efficiencies we are getting in the production line are starting to be self evident. And with those efficiencies, we would expect in 2013 to actually have some profit step ups on the production contracts, so we would expect the overall rate between the combined SCD contract and the LRIPs in 2013 to be higher than it were in 2012.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","","Thank you, very much. I may have missed it, but what did you say about the orders for the full year 2013, and could you give us a little split between if there is no sequestration I assume that to your assumption, and if there is sequestration, which part of our business, which of your orders, put it that way, 2013, do you see as a greatest risk?","Bruce L. Tanner","So 2013, the orders I was talking about, where we I think what I said is, we expect to have orders given our sales level that would essentially get us back to about $80 billion backlog, so you can kind of solve for the math, I will think of it as, I don\u2019t know somewhere $40 billion, $45 billion or so, and as far as, we are not assuming the effects of sequestration, as I said in my prepared remarks, and how that would manifest itself in terms of the impact in the orders, it always described IS&GS as a very short cycle business, if you look at the numbers for IS&GS right now, we are expecting a downturn in 2013 over 2012, and to large extent, that\u2019s because the federal IT budget has gone down, frankly with or without sequestration, I think a fair question is how much more can you take out as the federal IT budget even under sequestration environment you still accomplish a test that you need from an IT perspective.","We don\u2019t have a lot of, we look at, there has probably a shift over the past two years to have more of these IDIQ task orders. So I\u2019d suspect and a lot of those where they are occurring is in the IS&GS business, so I would expect during the sequestration we would see less extra sizing of those IDIQ task orders. I said earlier \u2013 in response to another question, I lost track who asked it, that I think we\u2019re seeing some of the sort of the push out orders right now in part, because of Secretary Carter\u2019s, guidance relative to preparation under the continuing resolution, and I would argue one of the prospects of sequestration, they are pushing out some of the larger orders I believe, anything over $0.5 billion as to go to him for approval or it\u2019s authorized.","so I\u2019m not knowing exactly how sequestration will be manifested in terms of what I\u2019d like to call the peanut spread versus a targeted spread, it\u2019s hard for me to say how those order could be impacted, whether they\u2019d be pushed to the right or reduced, and at this point, I\u2019d frankly be speculating at this point, other than to say IS&GS will likely get hit the largest percent would be my guess the longer cycle businesses would be get less approval than IS&GS.","Marillyn A. Hewson","All right. I will just add to that on the sequestration front, I mean that\u2019s why we have been so vocal about what a terrible policy that is to have sequestration come into play, some are very encouraged that we\u2019re trying to \u2013 that our government Congress is trying to get to a permanent elimination of those across the board cut, because if fact if they have, if they\u2019re going to take any cuts and they can do it along the lines of the national security strategy and do it in the areas that align better with what our administration and our entire defense is trying to accomplish that\u2019s the best outcome. And for us, as we look at it, I mean, I think we have a great portfolio that\u2019s aligned with those strategic priorities of the US government and our defense department. So if we get through sequestration, and it doesn\u2019t happen and it allows our defense department to decide where they take cuts, we think we\u2019re actually very well-positioned.","","Operator","","Thank you.

Strauss \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Marillyn a question for you, you guys have gone after you cost structure very aggressively just like you tell both from a square footage prospective and head count. Despite the fact that the budget hasn\u2019t come down much yet and your top line is held up pretty well. How much more room do you have to address headcount and square footage industrial cost structure and it\u2019s entirety, maybe disproportioning what happens to the budget from here.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Well I tell. we\u2019re a large corporation, and we have, I think we still have more opportunity particularly on the foot print side. As we laid out a plan to take cost out, we put it in more aggressively about 3 years ago and so we\u2019ve been about this pro active approach to taking out cost in our infrastructure and our processes for a number of years. As you mentioned we have had some reductions in for us we\u2019ve taken our some management layers, we\u2019ve been collapsing some organizations, in order to get some cost out in that regard.","And on the foot print side, we\u2019ve taken out about $1.9 million square feet for the last couple of years and we\u2019re going to take another $2.9 million between now and the end of 2014. So there is more to go there, I believe there is also opportunities for us. Just to continue on an ongoing basis to drive cost out, and so that we can meet the demand of our custom members. We\u2019ve been getting out of these space for example, we\u2019ll continue to look at even providing more affordable products to our customers taking weighed out at how we can reduce cycle time, all of those things that would give them a more affordable product as well.","So we\u2019ll continue to do that, that is something we set targets on every year, drive cost out of our business, and we want to continue to do that, remain competitive and win more business.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Good afternoon, Bruce I was wondering if you could walk a little bit through the cash in 2013 just as you get from cash flow from operations about $1.6 billion to over $4 billion. We know pension is certainly less of a headwind, but what else is improving taxes, interest advances working capital. What else for the drivers there?","Bruce L. Tanner","Let me see if I can do that on top off my head, Sam so $4 billion as you said in 2013 versus the $1.6 billion, level the biggest driver obviously is the $2.5 billion pension contribution, $3.6 million I guess I should say, versus the $1.5 million by 2013.","We\u2019re actually expecting a slight increase in our working capital and something I\u2019ll speak from myself, personally that I have targeted to try to minimize that amount of working capital growth. I think some of that might be a little bit of planning conservatism. We tend to plan, even say, our several international orders maybe a little bit lighter relative to payment terms than we actually are able to negotiate that ends up manifesting itself in the form of higher working capital than maybe what we actually experience that what I\u2019ll be watching.","Income taxes, I am trying to think what we\u2019re planning on income taxes. See, we\u2019re actually down, I believe, I think we\u2019re down probably like \u2013 we\u2019re actually further paying out relative to tax that is fairly close from booking within our earnings it\u2019s down probably about $150-ish million just. So it is sort of a cash flow up down. You see the $150 million from an earnings perspective going down the cash. As far as the biggest drivers that I am looking at next year, a little bit of change in depreciation, amortization, about enough to talk about, so really just sort of the working capital and a slight change in the taxes there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.\t","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company","Hi, good afternoon, Bruce and Jerry, and welcome to the earnings call process, Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thank you.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company","Marillyn, I wanted to ask you the sort of a follow up to the question on cost cutting, but a little bit bigger picture and long-term. One of the big concerns we still hear from investors on defense companies, is with regard to the sustainability of margins and whether or not there is a shoot or drop there. And in historical cycles, you\u2019ve seen margins come down pretty significantly, Lockheed Martin has been able to kind of hum along at this 11.5% segment operating margin right through everything we\u2019ve seen thus far.","How do you think about where margins go and how sustainable they are? Is there risk in your view that the part of the backlog was more favorable in terms of trade, sunsets and more difficult backlog layers in, just curious how you think about that given your many experiences operating the business?","And then, one quick for Bruce. Have you done the math on the 2014 FAS\/CAS number with the hypothetical that nothing changes in \u201814 versus \u201913.","Marillyn A. Hewson","Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll just kick-off with the margins. As you look at our portfolio, we have a lot of mature products that we have to move down the production lines and those that are moved into production and we\u2019re in position where we can drive higher margins through the process of booking higher profit rates on those programs moving forward.","And then as I said, we\u2019re growing our international sales component and through that process, because of the risk return relationship there on the international sales and we expect to get higher margins on that. While the portfolio is transitioning, if you think about where F-35 is, we are still on development, but concurrent to that we\u2019re moving into production and with that production over time and with the volume that we\u2019re going to bring along in a fixed price incentive environment and then fixed price environment, that\u2019s going to allow us to improve our margins.","LCS, with our LCS program, moving along as it ramps up with additional ships coming online, that will allow us to improve margins and a lot of our missile programs are well long in production. So there\u2019s fewer development programs in place, three to five elements coming along strongly. And then it\u2019s typically and internationally as I said, we see our margins. We think Bruce, do you want to take the other part of this question?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yeah. not if I remember right, have you done the math; I think you said FAS\/CAS in 2014 under the current assumption that we have done that math. Actually we have done about 15.2; I\u2019ll give you a bonus question there. So as we look at \u201814, we\u2019re probably seeing current course of speed somewhere about $350-ish million improvements over the $485 million we have today. I think the more interesting model is, as I look at the 13, 14, 15, I think of the change I should say, the change in the FAS\/CAS between \u201813 and \u201815 is roughly $1 billion. So we think of the 15 number is just about on the offsetting of the zero bar going the other way. So really, really dramatic swing in FAS\/CAS with current assumptions and obviously, if the discount rate goes north, and quite I should hope it does sometimes soon, then those commercials change even more dramatical.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company","And I think maybe one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of \tBill Loomis from Stifel Nicolaus.\t","Bill R. Loomis \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks for taking the question. Bruce, just when you talked about the first quarter being $1 billion lower. I just want to be clear that that was versus the year ago. And then you talked about the lower deliveries in aeronautics, but obviously with that grouping 3.7 billion in the first quarter \u201812 that would be a pretty significant percentage drop. So it is the bulk of that can be there and if now, which is the other groups and why do you see that coming back if it is coming from the other groups as well.","Bruce L. Tanner","So, Bill you heard rightly. The billion dollars I was talking about was comparing first quarter 2013 versus first quarter of 2012. I gave in my prepared remarks, the aircraft quality changes. So very, very significant within aeronautics and the reason we feel good about it coming back the other way is because those aircraft are higher on a comparative basis to the previous quarter in the next three quarters.","The other \u2013 just as I look at the data releases, I said here today. Part of the way, I would look at sales going forward. Again, I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. So think of the \u2013 it\u2019s obviously lower I believe every single quarter versus 2012, but it gets lower than 2012 by a smaller percent with each successive quarter. Said differently, fourth quarter 2013 is not nearly as far off of fourth quarters of 2012 on the first three quarters of 2013 versus the first three quarters of 2012.","And the other thing I looked at is the innovative software, but as more I just say, but the second half of the year from a revenue perspective is about $1 billion for that six months greater than the first half of the year. So we\u2019re definitely the level of back-end loaded in large part because of the aircraft qualities we heave there, but yes something of the other shifts within the business areas as well forcing in the second half.","Marillyn A. Hewson","So, I want to just wrap up here and tell you all thank you for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking to you in April.

I hope everyone has had a good start to the New Year.","As you heard Greg mention, we are joined today by Ken Possenriede, our CFO Elect, who will take over for Bruce after we file our 10-K in February, as Bruce has announced that he is retiring later this year. Ken and I worked together quite a bit over the years and I'm very excited that he will join our Executive Leadership Team as CFO. I'll have a few more thoughts to add about both Bruce and Ken after our Q&A portion of the call. But for now, welcome Ken.","Kenneth Possenriede","Thank you, Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","I'll begin by thanking our entire Lockheed Martin team for an impressive year and express my gratitude for their outstanding contribution throughout 2018. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations but also set records across a number of our financial metrics.","Notably, all four of our business areas grew sales, earnings and backlog during the year. Our strong performance was broad-based and a reflection of the continuing demand for our wide range of products.","I'll touch on some of the performance highlights in just a moment, including some important F-35 international activities, but I want to first discuss a few of the notable new business successes that contributed to our fourth quarter orders and showed the strength of our broad portfolio.","Aeronautics received the largest single order of the quarter and the year with the announcement of our F-35 production lots 12, 13 and 14 economic order quantity, or EOQ, award at an incremental value of approximately $19 billion, adding over 250 aircrafts to our backlog.","Our F-35 aircraft backlog has grown to nearly 400 planes, a level which exceeds the total of 35 deliveries we've made to-date, a clear sign of the program's momentum. We continue to work with the F-35 joint program office to finalize the full order of lots 12, 13 and 14, which once completed will represent a total of 478 aircraft.","International community expressed their continued interest in our legacy F-16 fighter program for both upgrades and new production units of our Viper Aircraft configuration. Our aero team closed on an opportunity with Greece to modernize 85 of their current F-16 fleet to this advanced platform, continuing the partnership with the Greek military that has spanned more than 70 years.","The Bulgarian Ministry of Defense announced their intent to procure eight new jets. Once the contract is finalized and definitized, Bulgaria will join Bahrain and Slovakia as new F-16 customers, extending our backlog of Fighting Falcons well into the mid-2020s.","Our Missiles and Fire Control team secured a PAC-3 Award to deliver over 450 interceptors, launcher modification kits and associated equipment to the U.S. Army and foreign military sales customers.","To-date, 13 nations have chosen PAC-3 products to provide missile defense capabilities for their citizens and we continue to expand our manufacturing facilities to satisfy the growing requirement.","Also this quarter, Rotary and Mission Systems won a competitive award from the Missile Defense Agency to design and develop a second homeland defense radar system and provide installation services for our solution in Hawaii.","This $585 million contract is part of the U.S. Military's ballistic missile defense system and will provide improved tracking and discrimination technologies to counter evolving ballistic missile threats.","This strategic win leverages capabilities developed on our long-range discrimination radar contract and provides the lowest risk solution to identify and warn of long-range ballistic missile threats during mid-course flight.","These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy programs as well as our commitment to innovation that has resulted in new strategic long-term growth opportunities. I'm very proud of our Lockheed Martin team and the passions with which we pursue new business solution to support our customers' missions.","Moving briefly to the federal budget environment, the Department of Defense is operating under the 2019 fiscal year Appropriations Act that became law last year. The Appropriations Act fully funded the Defense Department, providing approximately $617 billion of base budget funding for the nation's security and defense programs.","The legislation aligned with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided additional funding for national defense and raises the budget caps for fiscal 2019. We will wait the release of the FY20 Presidential Budget submission in the coming weeks. We believe it will align with the National Defense strategy's focus on missile defense, nuclear, space, cyber, joint lethality and intelligence capabilities. We anticipate that the budget input will reflect these priorities and we believe our portfolio is well aligned with this strategy.","We are hopeful that fiscal year 2020 funding will be in line with, or better than, prior Presidential Budget request and that it will continue to emphasize recapitalization of our nation's defense assets and the research and development that is critical to maintain our country's future security.","Several days ago, an agreement was reached to temporarily open, through February 15th, the federal agencies that were affected by the recent partial shutdown of the government. The previous closure of these agencies did not have a significant impact on this year's anticipated financial metrics, as a vast majority of our business is currently funded through the DOD's FY19 Appropriations Bill. Should the budget impasse recur after the three-week continuing resolution expires, it is possible we could see some delays in 2019 Awards and Orders.","As government leaders negotiate a new spending agreement, we continue to advocate for stable and consistent budgeting that enables U.S. government agencies and the industry to plan, invest and execute with confidence.","Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, we saw several accomplishments and important milestones take place this quarter that spotlight the program's mature production and base deployment activities, as well as the continuing demand we see from the international community.","First, we delivered our 91st F-35 aircraft of the year on December 20th, meeting our 2018 target and exceeding our 2017 deliveries by 25 jets, an increase of nearly 40%. Notably, of the 91 airplanes delivered last year, 37 were for international partners and foreign military sales customers, evidence of the growing global interest in this fifth-generation fighter.","In October, we were very pleased to learn that the Belgian Ministry of Defense selected the F-35 aircraft for its future fighter acquisition program. With this selection, Belgium becomes the 13th nation to join the F-35 program of record with the plan to buy of 34 conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL models.","Lockheed Martin is honored by the Belgian government's selection of the F-35 for their future national security needs, building on our long-running strategic partnership with the Belgian Air Force and their legacy fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. We look forward to continuing this relationship and helping to provide long-term capability for the Belgian Military.","In addition, Japan's National Security Council and Cabinet signaled continued support for the F-35, authorizing acquisition of 105 additional jets, adding to the 42 aircraft already approved. The Japanese F-35 plan includes, for the first time, acquisition of 42 short takeoff and vertical landing or STOVL variants. And the 147 total aircraft procurement will make Japan the largest international customer for this unrivaled fifth-generation fighter.","And just a week ago, the Republic of Singapore's Defense Minister announced the selection of F-35 as the aircraft most suitable to be their country's next-generation fighter. Singapore will initiate the process to procure a small number of jets to fully evaluate the capabilities of the plane, after which we will follow a decision as to the best approach to replace their legacy F-16 fleet. We are honored to be selected at this time and look forward to supporting the Republic of Singapore Air Force during this process.","Some of our original F-35 partners also celebrated key milestones this quarter. Australia welcomed the arrival of its first two F-35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft at Royal Australian Air Force Base, Williamtown, the site of Australia's first operational squadron. Australia becomes the seventh nation with F-35 aircraft based on their home soil, ushering in a new era for their nation's defensive capabilities.","And both Italy and the United Kingdom have now declared their respective fleets of F-35 combat-ready with the Italian Air Force declaring initial operational capability for their squadron of CTOL variants in late-November and the UK declaring IOC for their STOVL variants earlier this month.","With these announcements, we have now seen four countries declaring F-35-ready for frontline operations, demonstrating the maturity and momentum of the Joint Strike Fighter program.","In Missiles and Fire Control, our tactical and strike missile team delivered their first long-range anti-ship missiles called LRASM, precision-guided missile to U.S. operational units, thereby achieving early operational capability status ahead of the programs scheduled.","This milestone follows an intense integration and test phase, which culminated in the airlines for LRASM variant successfully completing multiple tests from the U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer Bomber, demonstrating our ability to rapidly deliver crucial capabilities to our war fighters. The LRASM program represents a long-term strategic opportunity and we are excited to have begun the journey with our first delivery.","In our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, we were very pleased to be selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as a member of Canada's combat ship team to be their preferred bidder to begin design work for the future fleet of Canadian Service Combatant ships. Lockheed Martin Canada will be the combat systems integrator and provide the combat management system we originally developed for the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class ships, providing important technology to help deliver a bow-to-stern, digitally-designed warship.","A total of 15 ships are planned to be built to replace Canada's Iroquois-class destroyer and Halifax-class frigates and will form the backbone of Canada's maritime combat power for decades to come. The Canadian Service Combatant Program is the largest defense project ever undertaken by the government of Canada. And when completed, the RMS team could see orders totaling approximately $7 billion for their role in this effort.","I'll close with our Space business area and a truly historic event. The NASA InSight Mars Lander designed and built by Lockheed Martin's Space engineers, made a dramatic entry and descend through the Martian atmosphere and successfully touched down on the surface of the red planet.","Over the course of 6.5 minutes, the InSight Lander went from a speed of 12,300 miles per hour to a gentle landing in the Equatorial region of Mars. The robotic explorer has now begun its task of studying the interior of the planet; its crust, mantle and core with a goal of better understanding the geologic evolution of Mars, as well as other terrestrial planets.","The InSight Mars Lander is the latest in the long Lockheed Martin heritage of participating in NASA and Mars programs dating back to 1976 in the Viking mission, and we are honored to have played a significant role in this and all 10 preceding NASA missions to Mars.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks Marillyn; and good morning, everyone.","As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Both our sales and segment operating profit continued to exceed our expectations, as we close out the year.","Sales were $53.8 billion for the year, while segment operating profit was nearly $5.9 billion, about $800 million and $100 million higher, respectively, than when we spoke in October and this helped drive earnings per share to $17.59, also above over last outlook.","We generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations, after contributing $5 billion in pension contributions. Operating cash flow was slightly below our expectation, as a number of invoices were not paid until the beginning of 2019, taking longer to pay than our history would've led us to expect.","As a result of this carryover and continued strong cash performance, we have increased our cash guidance for 2019 above the outlook we provided in October and will discuss this in more detail in later charts.","We've returned $3.8 billion of cash to our stockholders, $2.3 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Our repurchase amount was higher than planned for the year, as we opportunistically increased our buybacks in the fourth quarter as overall equity markets declined, so we could capitalize on the reduced share price of Lockheed Martin as we closed out the year.","And, finally, but perhaps most importantly, we achieved a record level for backlog at year-end, finishing at over $130 billion. So we had a very strong finish to the year and we're well positioned to carry that momentum into 2019.","Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in 2018 with our performance in 2017. Sales grew 8% for the year, while segment operating profit grew by 15% for the year, both finishing at record levels and all four business areas grew in both metrics as we'll show in the next couple of charts.","On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for the year by business area. Missiles and Fire Control had the strongest growth in 2018 at 16%, driven by continued tactical and strike missile growth along with increases in the Air Missile Defense portfolio.","Aeronautics grew by 9% for the year with F-35 providing most of that growth, while the Skunk Works and F-16 program also contributed to the increase, more than offsetting reductions in the C-5 program as we completed the RERP program in 2018.","Both RMS and Space had low single-digit increases in sales for the year with the RMS growth driven by the integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business, while the Space growth came from a strategic and missile defense line of business.","On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in 2018 versus our results in 2017. Here, RMS had the largest increase in operating profit, 44% higher than last year. This increase was due to improved performance across the Sikorsky portfolio, as well as the absence of a charge taken last year on the EADGE-T program.","Missiles and Fire Control grew operating profit by 21%, due to improved performance in tactical and strike missiles and a number of sensor programs. Space increased operating profit by 8%, due to improved performance in both the commercial and government satellite lines of business, and Aero grew its operating profit by low-single digits due to higher volume and improves performance on both F-35 production and sustainment contracts.","If you'll turn to Chart 7, we'll discuss the significant increase in earnings per share this year compared with last year. We ended the year with EPS of $17.59, an increase of roughly 33% over our 2017 EPS after adding back $6.77 worth of net tax reform changes that negatively impacted last year's results.","Our results for the year included a negative impact of a non-cash impairment and the international joint venture investment that reduced EPS by $0.29. The overall increase this year was driven by higher segment operating profit and a lower effective tax rate.","Chart 8 shows the increase in backlog over last year's amount to a - the record level of $130 billion. Backlog grew nearly 25%, driven by a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5 for the year with Aeronautics setting the larger increase but all four business areas grew backlog in the year.","Chart 9 provides our outlook for the expected performance and key financial metrics in 2019. Our sales guidance of $55.75 billion to $57.25 billion is higher at the midpoint than the high-end of the range we provided during the October call and implies 5% growth over our 2018 results. Segment operating profit at the midpoint also implies a margin at the high-end of the range that we gave in October.","Our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $1.475 billion is $25 million lower than we estimated last quarter and we'll discuss the drivers of the change in a couple of charts.","Our EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the $19.15 to $19.45 range, nearly 10% higher than our results in 2018. And we expect cash from operations will be equal to or greater than $7.4 billion, recognizing both the invoices that carried over into 2019 from 2018 and an improved outlook from the business areas for the year.","Chart 10 shows the expected business area ranges for both sales and segment operating profit for the year. Missiles and Fire Control is again expected to be our fastest growing business area with around 10% growth over 2018, while Aeronautics is expected to grow in the high single-digit level. RMS and Space are both expected to have slight increases over their 2018 results.","Margins for the business areas are roughly comparable to our performance in 2018 except for Space, which has impacted this year by lower equity earnings at ULA as we discussed on the last call.","On Chart 11, we provide a comparison of our net FAS\/CAS adjustment and our current outlook compared with the preliminary review we provided in October. The return on plan assets during 2018 was negative 5% versus a positive 1% return when we spoke in October, reflecting the large reductions in equity returns that occurred between October and the end of the year and this change in our return lowered the adjustment by $120 million.","The discount rate used to value our liabilities increased slightly to 4.25% and this results in a $60 million improvement. Other actuarial updates to the plan, primarily a revised longevity expectation contributed to a $35 million of improvement. All told, these updates lower the FAS\/CAS adjustment by $25 million to our new expectation of $1.475 billion.","And, finally, at the bottom of the chart, we mentioned two pension risk mitigation transactions that we completed in December, but have no significant impact on either our financial results in 2018 or our projections for 2019 and we'll describe these transactions in more detail on the next chart.","Chart 12 summarizes the two pension transactions that occurred in December. These transactions are transferring the responsibility for pension obligation for around 41,000 or a little more than 25% of our current retirees to two insurers. There is no change in the timing or amount of pension payments to our retirees, but with the transfer we've eliminated all volatility associated with $2.5 billion of current pension obligations.","We had favorable pricing on the transfer and we immediately see a $25 million per year reduction in our PBGC premiums going forward, and we have the option to settle around $800 million of planned liabilities with the U.S. government at a future date, which would accelerate CAS prepayments into the year of settlement, increasing our cash from operations in that year by the amount of the CAS acceleration.","So we think this creates a win-win situation, providing the same benefits to retirees going forward, while reducing future volatility for the business and our customers.","And, finally, on Chart 13, we have our summary. 2018 was an outstanding year for both operational and financial performance. We're very pleased with the record backlog that we achieved last year and that all four business areas contributed to that record level. And we're very excited to continue to deliver growth and long-term value creation in 2019 and beyond.","With that, we're ready for questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Bruce, many congrats to you. It was great working with you; and Ken, welcome on-board.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Noah.","Kenneth Possenriede","Thank you.","Noah Poponak","Bruce, so with the cash flow guidance for 2019, it looks like it\u2019s maybe slightly better operationally than you thought before and then you had the slippage out of 2018. So, one, is that true that it's a little better operationally? And then two, I guess for - year-over-year into 2020, you previously had a placeholder of something in the zone of flat, can you still be flat to slightly up in 2020 even with the working capital lift that I guess is specific to 2019?","And then may be update us, I think you'd previously said, on '21 when the pension contribution comes back online that you saw enough working capital opportunity to offset that and grow cash flow again. Is that still the case?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So let me dive into that, I think it's a three- parter there, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Got to get it in before you go.","Bruce Tanner","Very good of you. So yes, we are operationally seeing improved cash from operations in 2019. Part of that is simply because we are having higher profit from the business areas and in the form of segment operating profit and we would expect to recover some of that in terms of cash in 2019. So it's a combination just as you described it.","The carryover in invoices, call it, $250 million or so plus some improvement in operations from the business areas making up the difference to get to $400 million.","You asked about 2020 flat to up. I'd say we are still seeing the outlook for probably both 2020 and 2021 in the 7 - at least $7 billion or greater range. We've had a little bit of pressure as you might expect, because of the lower performance of our pension plan.","So just like everyone else from October to December, as I described in my prepared remarks, the pension trust went for a slightly positive return to a 5% negative. But if you take a look at the total change and expectations of assets to asset return to where we ended up, that's a pretty big miss.","And so, we'll have some continued higher ERISA payments that start to kick in about the 2020 timeframe, higher than what we talked about in the last call and higher still than what we talked about, I think, on the last call in 2021. Even with those higher ERISA contributions to sort of refill the pension trust for the asset performance last year, we still expect to achieve another $7 billion-plus in each of those payments - in each of those years, excuse me, going forward.","And that is a reflection, Noah, to your question of improved performance and working capital as well as the higher segment operating profit and return of cash resulting from that in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the F-35, there's clear signs that it's growing and there is continued growth in the program. How do we, maybe, think about the cadence of that 400 aircraft conversion and maybe the profit curve on that program given international and as the block buy versus the multiyear?","Bruce Tanner","Everyone is going to do three-parters this time, ah?","Sheila Kahyaoglu","One topic, three parts.","Bruce Tanner","So, yeah, F-35's got a real good cadence. I thought it was really interesting to listen to Marillyn talk about the fact that we got more aircraft at the end of the year in terms of backlog than we\u2019ve delivered since the inception of the program. That's a - just thinking about that, that's a big number.","And that reflected for the block buy getting, call it, 250 aircrafts worth of - sort of advance payment and that was the large award that we booked in the fourth quarter. But it's only, what, 250 out of what we expect LRIP 12, 13 and 14 to be which is closer to about 400 - call it, 475 to 480 aircrafts.","So we would expect over time to get those higher quantities of aircraft and you'll see that reflect in the backlog going forward. You will also see, Sheila, growth in our expected deliveries going forward from 91 this year to about 131, I said 91 this year, 91 in 2018 to about 131 next year. And that number will grow slightly higher in 2020 and slightly higher still in 2021, at least that's the expectation until we actually get north of 160 deliveries in 2021, so good continuing ramp up there.","You asked about margins, we see - we had good performance in 2018 and we expect to see especially on the production program some continued good performance. I would expect margins to maybe increase 50-plus basis points over what we saw in 2018 as we sort of get to a more steady-state of what we expect to have as we've talked about for quite some time of margin similar to our experience on other production programs in our portfolios, including F-16, F-22 and C-130s and the like.","And the only thing I might offer up, Sheila, is, we're seeing production growth as I talked about with the quantities of aircraft, but we're also seeing some pretty significant sustainment growth and I think I have said this on the last call, somewhat surprisingly, actually on a percentage basis the fastest growing part of the F-35 program is actually the development program. And that's because we're starting to get modifications of the aircrafts, some international peculiar updates for improvements going forward. So that's actually growing as well.","And as I think I said on prior calls, well, that's typically cost reimbursable and therefore lower margin overall than the program, that still good work that leads to future production and\/or sustainment work going forward. So program is in a very good position right now and on a strong cadence as we end 2018 and going into 2019.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Bruce, can you touch a little bit on the - just on the - kind of related to Noah\u2019s question in terms of cash sustainability, obviously cash recovery is a big piece of that operating cash flow, that $7 billion, just given that what you know has happened in 2018? Now, any update on the shape of that cash number going forward? How long [is it with us] [ph] till it roll off there? Thank you.","Bruce Tanner","So we've talked about in the past that whenever there is a change in expectations relative to our performance and we're more sensitive, I think I've said that in the past as we sit here today, on asset returns than we are on discount rates with our pension financials going forward. So because we were short of our expectations in 2018, you will see a slight increase in the near-term of CAS to essentially recoup that shortage in our expectations over time.","Unfortunately, ERISA requires an earlier contribution than I even - even after we've had CAS [normalization] [ph], we should still think of CAS recovery on our contract takes longer to occur than the ERISA contributions, and that's the comment that I was making earlier to Noah about a little bit of higher ERISA contributions in the near-term.","But to your question, Jon, CAS will - I think in 2018, we're about 2.4, call it, a little more than that billion dollars. I would think CAS at the new levels based on our performance in 2018 will probably stay at the, call it, 2.5, I think we're a little higher than that level of CAS reimbursements in 2019. And then it sort of stays that way in '20, '21, '22 and then current course and speed if we continue to get 7% returns on the assets going forward, we would expect to see a significant reduction in CAS costing and CAS recoveries from '22 to, call it, 2026 and beyond to a very, very steep down slope in terms of CAS reductions there.","So sort of not much change in the next three, four years and then if we continue on the current course and speed or we do better on asset returns going forward, then we would expect to see a pretty good size reduction in that. You would also expect to see at a quicker pace a reduction in the ERISA contributions, because ERISA is spread over shorter period of time to sort of recoup the asset return miss we had in 2018 than is the CAS spread, if you will. So CAS is spread longer to recoup that. Hope that helps, Jon.","Operator","And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","When you look at the backlog build, right, I guess a lot of that had to do with F-35 and the year-end backlog was, I think, probably a little bit above what you guys were thinking in Q3, right. And then I look at the guidance for the year, I mean how much conservatism is built in there? Because it just looks like with that kind of backlog build that revenue growth this year might be a little bit better. I don't know I'm just kind of throwing that one out there?","Bruce Tanner","Well, I guess if I was smart I'd set Ken up for a bigger number than a lower number, but I think we've got opportunities varying and we talk about Missiles and Fire Control growing 10%. We talked about Aeronautics growing at the high single-digit. Space and RMS, a very slight growth. If there's one business area I think that might have some potential revenue upside, I would say, it's probably RMS.","We sort of went into the year last year expecting RMS to be a little flattish, maybe a little bit of growth and I think we ended up at 4% or so growth for the year. So we beat that pretty well. I think there's a similar potential here.","We've got - I'll tell you, we've got a lot of new start programs. I mean, I was looking for list, getting ready for the call, it's just staggering, how many small literal new start pattern, that could translate into large patterns across all four business areas, so one of the sound bites I like more than anything is that while backlog grew for the corporation to a record level backlog grew for each of the four business areas. So this is very broad-based and very strong.","Again, not so much in huge big bite-sized chunks but a lot of smaller patterns is really what's driving that. And so, to your question, Ron, I think we have some potential upside, but I don't-we didn't purposely try to be ultraconservative in the revenue guidance. I think that's why we provide the range and that's why the upside is potentially at the top of the range.","I should have said, maybe they'll just a piggyback, I didn't answer I think Sheila's last question on the multiyear and that may be part of what you're asking about as well. But we would expect to see a multiyear agreement on the F-35 program probably sometime in the 2022 timeframe, so while we may see some slight backlog deterioration this year, it's hard to replicate the large block buy order that we saw in 2018.","We still expect to be probably north of $125 billion of backlog as we end the year and then that has the potential to grow from that level as we get into 2022 with the benefit of an F-35 block - excuse me, multiyear.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Stallard","Bruce, I will spare you a pension question and just wish you the best for your retirement.","Bruce Tanner","You break my heart with that pension question, Rob.","Rob Stallard","But Marilyn I have one for you. On the F-35 front, there's been various press reports that the DOD could be flirting with an F-16 order and comments from the Acting Secretary of Defense today seems to imply that there could be some pressure perhaps ahead for you on pricing for the F-35. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that?","Marillyn Hewson","I would be happy to, Rob. In terms of the F-35, as we've outlined clearly, I mean it's well supported across the board regardless of what other platforms, the Department of Defense was looking at. So if they chose to have an order on F-15, I don't - it won't be at the expensive of F-35 quantities. I mean, I'm hearing that directly from leadership in the Pentagon and I think that's an important point to make, not just our suspicion, but I've been told that directly. So, I'm not concerned about that.","In terms of the pressure on the unit cost, we continue to have focus collectively with the Joint Program Office and with the Department of Defense on driving the price of the F-35 down and seeing the cost. We are on a path to drive it to an $80 million for the F-35A by full rate production when we're looking at 2023 deliveries of that aircraft and when we get to about 15 deliveries.","So that's - as long as we stay on our procurement rate plan, which by all accounts we're going to continue to ramp up the rate that we envisioned and we're going to continue to drive the price down and that's our target as to continue drive the unit cost down. And we won't stop there, we will always be looking at ways that we can take the cost down in the program as it continues to mature and grows.","Moreover, the total life cycle cost of the aircraft is coming down. We're working on the sustainment element, which is always something that our customers are interested in, not just purchase price but what does it cost to sustain the aircraft as its operational and those costs are coming down at a good pace as well.","Operator","Next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","One clarification and then one question, so Bruce you mentioned the headwind on ULA, I'm just curious if it's still $150 million? And the question, maybe for Marilyn, you're seeing the start of some of the first incremental customers coming to the F-35 in quite some time. Do you think there is actually pressure to the upside from these 160 per year, probably planning rates that you've had for a number of years. I know you have gotten request for something higher than that, but at what point do you think there's reality behind some of those requests for pricing for upward of 180 per year pricing?","Bruce Tanner","Well, I'll take the first part. You've got a good memory, Myles. We did talk, I think on the October call about as much as $150 million pressure from ULA year-over-year from 2018 to 2019. I think you should think of that closer to maybe like $100 million now. And part of that is, we did get a little better outlook from ULA, but that's part of it.","But the bigger piece quite honestly was, we actually had a launch vehicle that we had expected to deliver in the latter part of December, that for weather purposes and some other purposes, actually slipped into 2019. In fact, you might have seen - that was the first launch of the year. It was actually an event that was supposed to have occurred last year.","So think of that launch carrying on for and the profits associated with that launch vehicle also carrying over, which made that $150 million along with the improved performance expectation at ULA cause a number to, like I said, probably be about a $100 million short of last year's ULA equity earnings amount.","And I'll turn it over to Marillyn for the F-35 question.","Marillyn Hewson","Yes, Myles, to your question about the growth in the international demand for the program, we are certainly seeing with a highlight of few near-term things, but F-35 is in the competitions in Switzerland and Finland and Germany and whole range of countries that continue to look at it. So we expect to continue to see growth in the international demand.","Your question around, can we increase the rate accordingly or so forth. I mean, it's really too early to be too specific on that, but over time if we could see that we could exceed the current program of record on the F-35 and that would open up the opportunity for us to produce more per year. And we have the manufacturing capacity for over 180 aircraft per year.","We'll still have to coordinate with the JPO, the Joint Program Office, we'll still have to work with our supply chain and our international customers to really get the most effective plan possible. But we could certainly go to a higher rate if the demand were such that we needed to do that. So that's a good problem to have and we look forward to that.","Myles Walton","And Japan?","Marillyn Hewson","And also Japan, yes, I mentioned Japan already in my formal remarks about the increase there as they have already committed to 105 aircraft and we expect some of the existing customers to continue to increase their demand for the aircraft as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Bruce, let me join the others and say you've done absolutely terrific, and best of wishes in your retirement.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr","So in line with the two-part question, book-to-bill, if you could comment a little bit by the outlook for the year in the sectors? And secondly, you said, as I understood it, that the F-35 had may be 50 bps of margin upside. I thought that was in 2019. And if so, where is the downside? Because your aggregate guide shows Aeronautical margins relatively stable - may be up 10 bps?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So let me - I'll try to address both of those for you, Cai. So book-to-bill, the 15, although there was obviously the 2018 results. The outlook for 2019, which I think is the heart of your question, we expect to have less orders in 2019 as you might expect, since we're not going to replicate the block buy order for F-35.","But as I said in response to a previous question, I think backlog - if we had a little more than $130 billion now, I think we dropped, call it, $4 million or $5 million to maybe a $125 billion plus. So we still expect to have a strong orders year in 2019. I think just for planning purposes, the things that you should watch out for is we are hopeful to get pretty large THAAD order for both combined by from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as MDA or ultimately to the U.S. Army in the first quarter.","As it turns out a little bit unusual compared to our pattern maybe in prior years, the second quarter is expected to be our largest order quarter and that's in part because we'll start - or at least we expect to start to definitize the LRIP 12, 13 and 14 that was authorized by the block buy. This would be just for the LRIP 12 portion and that definitization is a fairly good-sized number, call it north of $5 billion is the item there as well as some other orders we expect there.","For instance, we expect to get an order for two Orion vehicles in the second quarter as well. And may be somewhat surprisingly just given the size compared to years previously, they got a multiple launch rocket system, 14, as we're calling it is about $1 billion order that we're looking to see potentially in the second quarter.","So a little different phasing, as I said, for the orders in 2019 still strong, quite honestly not a whole lot of competitive awards there, most of them are sort of soul-source follow-on awards and without the benefit, as I said, earlier the block buy behind us or the potential for multiyear on F-35 in front of us. So, hopefully, that help sort of the orders in our expectation.","F-35, the 50 basis points that I was talking about is my expectation of improvement on the F-35 program for the 2019 margins compared to 2018 margins, a lot of that coming on the production program as we really are starting to kind of hit, as I said earlier, sort of cadence there. And why that's offset is part of what I said earlier, Cai.","I mean, literally there is - I think I'm literally writing down 15, 16 programs. They're all smaller than the large programs that I'm talking about that have the margin increases, but we have got classified activity in three of the four business areas that starting to get some traction. Aeronautics is one of those where we have that. We've got Hypersonics work in Aeronautics.","So a lot of, sort of, new start programs, including as I said earlier we're having growth in the sustainment and the development program on the F-35 program actually at a faster rate than the production rate is. And that's great news, but it does come with a slightly lower margins or the combination of all the new starts faster growing on some of the legacy stuff within the F-35 programs with lower margin, that's the reason why you don't see the overall Aeronautics margin growing from its - sort if it's level.","We're frankly happy with that, because that says we're sort of growing margin in the programs that you think should be growing margins, but we're getting the benefit of new programs - new start programs that have the potential to be the long-term growth engines of the corporation and, of course, those come with lower margins.","Operator","And next we'll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Marillyn, maybe a question about politics in D.C. I feel like a lot of people are thinking that getting this last two-year resolution to the sequester might be maybe the most difficult compared to - than we've had so far. Would you agree with that? Is it going to be a challenge just kind of given where the parties are at or I know recently some of the - both parties that are directly involved on the defense committee seem to be a little bit more optimistic, but where do you kind of come down there? And how do you're thinking about timing on that?","Marillyn Hewson","Yes, that's a great question. I wish I had a crystal ball to answer it, but I would just say that and we - as you know, predominance of our U.S. government business is the Defense business. And so, I think last year were around 59% or 60% of our revenue was U.S. - was Department of Defense.","Of course, we have NASA, Homeland Security and other pieces of it. But what I am hearing in my discussions with Members of Congress is the bipartisan support for defense spending. I mean there is no doubt that the threats are getting greater around the world. We've - you've seen the National Defenses Strategy that came out.","You've seen the National Security Strategy, which I think have been much more direct about the great power competition with China and Russia and also the other players like Iran and North Korea and others. I mean, it's just - it's not getting lighter, it's getting accelerated, and with that we know that not only is there a global threat accelerating and growing, but in addition to that we need to recapitalize.","And so there needs to be expenditure on recapitalization and our weapon systems as well as research and development on all the technology changes and unpredictable nature of the balance space as we're seeing as our adversaries taking advantage of all that technology.","So when you go look at what has been outlined in that National Defense Strategy, it's clear that what is requested aligns very well with our portfolio. I highlighted some of it in my earlier remarks, but all of the things that need to be spent on, whether it's on the nuclear or space or the C4ISR or all those elements of intelligence capabilities and air dominance et cetera are all areas that we play in and that we think our portfolio is very well aligned with.","The one area I think we all are trying to watch is now, how much pressure there will be on putting more spending in the domestic non-defense side of spending. And so, that would be the pressure point that we'll all watch, because I think if you've seen what's been brought forward by the President's - earlier President's Budget request, we're expecting to see the updated one that comes out for 2020, there's been a strong focus on defense.","And so, it will just be a matter of how that plays against the non-defense spending and we are hopeful that it will line up with what we need as a nation, which is to protect our citizens and focus on national security.","Operator","And the next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thank. Bruce, I also want to give you my congratulations. Job well done.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Dave.","David Strauss","Now I pay you with pension. As far as the contribution, would you mind spelling out exactly kind of what you're thinking about for '20 and '21, now? I think before you were saying couple of hundred million in '20 and like $1.5 million in '21? And then the second parter on CapEx. Can you talk about what you're thinking there and how that kind of comes through in terms of higher depreciation over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","David, I'd be disappointed if we had our last conversation and you didn't ask me about pension. So I appreciate the question there. 2020 ERISA contributions, I think we talked about those being in a couple of hundred million dollars level last time we spoke in October.","Again, that was before - the roughly 6% swing in asset returns that happened from October to the end of the year. If those - and this is a little bit fluid, because things can change between now and then obviously with good performance in 2019 and we're actually off to a good start as I'm sure everyone is in the first month or so in 2019 in terms of asset returns, so bear that in mind when I say this, but if we were to have drawn the line at the end of 2018 with the performance when we left it at a 5% negative return. We'd probably see at least a couple of hundred million dollars more contribution in 2020.","And then relative to - I think you said it right, it was about $1.6 billion or so - $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion I think where it was in 2021, probably also a couple of hundred million dollars and you should think of that as back to the phasing of ERISA to recover asset return shortfalls is sort of spread over like a - not quite a decade long, call it, nine years or so. And the recovery from a CAS is sort of spread over a longer period, call it or 12 or 13 years.","So at any one point in time, we'll have more - at the front end of that time period, we'll have more contributions required to ERISA. At the back-end, we'll have no ERISA contributions and peer recovery from a CAS perspective. So think of that again several hundred million dollars up in both years 2020 and 2021 as we sit here today with the potential that that could change based on good performance in 2019.","I'm sorry, David, I forgot, you also asked about CapEx and depreciation. So, we're going to increase capital expenditures in 2019, probably think of it as - I think we finished last year 2018 about $1.3 billion. Our outlook is probably $300 million or $400 million higher than that in 2017 - 2019 and we'll probably pretty close to that in 2020.","And the drivers of that are some things we have talked about previously. We've got some completion of a facility at our Space Systems, our Space operations in Denver to help with a more efficient way to build and deliver satellites and as well as get some capacity there.","We have got significant growth in Missiles and Fire Control, both from a building perspective to house some employee growth that we talked about on some previous calls, but also both infrastructure equipment and buildings for that matter to increase capacity, primarily in our weapons business, as we talked about previously.","So we're - that's a good news thing. We're spending money to increase the CapEx, but that is in turn increasing the capital or the capacity of our weapons program at Missiles and Fire Control. We've also got and I think I mentioned this previously, we've also got several awards and I know I have mentioned this earlier in the call, but classified contracts sort of around the corporation. Some of those actually come with capital needs as well, but that is to feed, again, the capabilities to support that growing classified business going forward.","So all of those are growing faster than our depreciation recovery as you might expect, but that's good news. That's where the future growth at both the top end and the bottom end of the business will come from and ultimately our depreciation will catch up. It's sort of like the pension asset return. It's just a little bit delayed there. So we're happy to be sending of the capital to the levels we had today and we look forward to the growth of that CapEx will drive from a capacity perspective going forward.","Greg Gardner","John, we're coming over the top of the hour. We'll take one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Thanks for fitting me in, and Bruce let me take a second and also extend my congrats on what's been a great performance on the role. I hope you really enjoy your retirement.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland","I will stick to the one in the interest of time and that's on MFC and Bruce wondered if you could just may be dig into the performance a little bit there? You obviously had a very strong profit performance and you call that risk retirements and volume are being the source of that. Should we assume that the vast majority of that was risk retirements? Because I would assume that the classified shrink that you called out on the top line would've had a negative mix impact. So, anything you do to kind of help us understand what drove that result?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. I think you characterized it appropriately, Carter. We did have as we closed the year out some really good performance on a couple of programs that resulted in higher risk retirements. We are seeing, as you also point out, some growing volume at lower margins, primarily in the classified arena.","But again if I just sort of rattle off some programs in Missiles and Fire Control that are helping to contribute to some of the higher growth but lower margin business. We're seeing that on the classified business. Missiles and Fire Control is heavily, heavily involved in Hypersonic's work. Indirectly it got some sort of Directed Energy work as well.","The JAGM replacement, so I think of that as the Hellfire replacement is starting to see some early production volume, which is great news but it is lower margins than the legacy Hellfire program. Ultimately, we think that will be comparable but not at this early stage of development and production.","So, a lot of good growth coming. Again, the fastest growing business area in the corporation, both for legacy programs, but frankly most of the legacy growth is going to be a little bit delayed, it requires the capital expenditures that I talked about previously to get most of that growth in there. So, we're seeing that offset in the near-term by growth on a lot of new start programs. And, again, that's the great news, because this is the Cyclone for future growth at Missiles and Fire Control that will last for the next decade or so.","And, as a result of all that, we're looking at margins pretty comparable for the year at Missiles and Fire Control in 2019 to 2018. And, again, just as I said earlier, you should think of that as the programs where you would think margins are improving, they are. And it's sort of being mitigated by a lot of smaller and new start programs with lower margins as they begin their production or development phases.","Greg Gardner","Thank you, John. I think I'll end the call now by turning it over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Thank you, Greg. Before I conclude the call there, I would like to take a moment to celebrate the career and upcoming retirement of Bruce Tanner. Bruce began his career more than 37 years ago in Fort Worth, where he worked on the F-16 program. And like the F-16 itself, Bruce has been a driving force in this company's success for many years. For the past 11-plus years, Bruce has been our Chief Financial Officer, so many of you have gotten to know him through the past 46 earnings calls and his participation in numerous investor meetings and conferences, and you know that Bruce is thoughtful, honest and even keeled.","He's always prepared and he does his best to answer every question that comes from our investors and analysts. And I personally consider it an honor and pleasure to have had the opportunity to work with Bruce in many points throughout my career.","Within our company, we have benefited from his deep expertise, his strategic focus and his leadership. Regardless of the challenges we faced at any given time, Bruce has helped our company grow and flourish. Because of his commitment to mentoring and building up others, his impact and his influence will shape Lockheed Martin for decades to come.","Many of you know that we put tremendous focus on strong leadership talent development and succession planning at Lockheed Martin. That's why as Bruce transitions out, we're delighted to welcome Ken Possenriede as our CFO on February 11th. Ken and I have also worked closely together, dating back to our days leading the Electronic Systems business area and more recently as our Corporate Treasurer and Finance Executive at our Space and Aeronautics business area. His experience and track record are impeccable and I look forward to maintaining our momentum with Ken at the helm of our high end organization.","So we wish Bruce the very best for his well-earned retirement later this year as he returns to Texas to enjoy more time with his family, including his three grandchildren. Bruce, on behalf of our shareholders and our employees, I thank you for your leadership and your outstanding contribution. And Ken, we welcome you to the team.","A - Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn.","A - Marillyn Hewson","So, thank you again for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you in our next earnings call in April.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2019 earnings call as we review our quarterly results and increased financial outlook for 2019. As today\u2019s release details, we had a very strong quarter financially, strategically and operationally. As you will see from some of the performance highlights and quarterly achievements that I will discuss in a few minutes, we have a remarkable team, dedicated and talented employees who are designing, developing and producing innovative solutions for our customers and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to them.","Before I discuss the quarter in depth, I would like to take a moment to comment on the recent announcements regarding the decision by the U.S. government to suspend Turkey from the F-35 program. The U.S. government made this difficult decision and as always we will continue to follow any official guidance as it relates to the delivery of the F-35 to Turkey or the export of goods from the Turkish supply chain. Although the current program of record for total deliveries to Turkey is 100 planes, the quantities included for them in the recent lot 12 through 14 handshake agreement were a modest 8 aircraft per year. Also, Lockheed Martin has been partnering closely with the U.S. government and our supply chain to minimize the impact to the F-35 program. Over the last several months, we have been working to establish alternate sources of supply in the United States to quickly accommodate Turkey\u2019s current contributions to the program. These actions should limit any future production or sustainment impact and we remain on track to meet our commitment of delivering 131 F-35s this year. As F-35 in the fleet deliver exceptional capability and as cost continue to come down, we see increasing global demand for the F-35 that will grow the total program of record. We believe the F-35 program remains healthy and is performing exceptionally well for all of its stakeholders. We will discuss the F-35 in more detail later on the call.","Moving back to our quarterly results, the Corporation continues to perform with excellence, driving outstanding growth and strong financial results and create value for stockholders. This performance from across the Corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2019 enables us to increase our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All four of our business areas experienced growth this quarter and each has contributed to our updated full year outlook reflecting the outstanding performance of our entire team. Our backlog has continued to increase and is again at a record level. Our broad portfolio and long-term growth opportunities have us well positioned to deliver outstanding value for our stockholders.","I will touch on a few of our financial achievements upfront and Ken will discuss our results in more detail a little later on the call. We grew sales again this quarter exceeding last year\u2019s second quarter by 8% with each business area increasing revenues from the second quarter of 2018. The growth was led by missiles and fire control from ramping production rates for tactical and strike weapons particularly precision fires as well as from increased sales in new hypersonics and classified programs. Our space organization also experienced strong sales growth with the Overhead Persistent Infrared and GPS III contracts, two programs we won last year contributing to year-over-year increases. The space, strategic and missile defense line of business also contributed to increased revenues because of strong volume in new hypersonic programs being performed in this business area.","Our segment profit increased by 6% year-over-year as strong performance across the Corporation contributed to the growth. As with sales, missiles and fire control and space led the way with improved operational performance and the growth in revenues I just discussed driving the increases. These outstanding results in sales and earnings and our focus on cost reductions and operational efficiencies also allowed us to increase our full year outlook for cash from operations to at least $7.6 billion. Our portfolio of products and services is well aligned with our customers\u2019 needs with both our legacy solutions and new technologies in high demand. Our heritage of innovation and performance remains strong and we are excited by our long-term growth opportunities.","I will discuss some significant performance milestones in just a moment, including a tremendous honor bestowed upon our F-35 team. But first, I would like to highlight a few key orders and award activities that demonstrate the value of our broad portfolio. In aeronautics, our F-35 organization and the Department of Defense announced a handshake agreement for the production of lots 12, 13 and 14 aircraft, totaling 478 jets. Once finalized, this contract will represent the largest F-35 production contract to-date and will mark the largest procurement in the history of the Defense department. I would like to express my thanks to both the Pentagon\u2019s joint program office and the Lockheed Martin F-35 team for the outstanding coordination and cooperation they have shown in arriving at this historic agreement.","Importantly, with this agreement, we now offer the Lot 13 F-35A model at a unit price below our longstanding objective of $80 million, thereby achieving this target 1 year earlier than planned. Through relentless focus on cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies, across the F-35 enterprise, we can now offer this remarkable fifth generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft making this platform the best value fighter jet available in the world. We are proud to be able to provide this unrivalled stealth fighter to our nation\u2019s war fighters, our partners and international customers and we look forward to finalizing this agreement in the coming months.","In our space business area, our team continued to build on its previous Hacksaw and conventional prompt strike hypersonic wins. During the second quarter, we were selected as the prime contractor for the long-range hypersonic weapon system integration effort in support of the army hypersonic projects office. In addition, our space organization is part of the team led by Dynetics that was selected by the U.S. Army for the common hypersonic glide body prototype contract. We anticipate that both of these opportunities will be negotiated in the next few months and when finalized would bring the potential value of all of the hypersonic contracts across the corporation, including those awards we discussed on our last earnings call to over $3.5 billion.","Moving to Missiles and Fire Control, we received several contract awards in our tactical missile line of business, totaling over $1.6 billion which led to a quarterly book-to-bill 2.0. The three separate awards were for Hellfire Missiles, Atacms Missiles and the recapitalization of Multiple Launch Rocket System equipment in support of the U.S. Army and international customers as demand for strike weapons continues. In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team was awarded $1.1 billion contract from the U.S. Navy for 12 CH-53K low rate initial production or LRIP 2 and 3 heavy lift helicopters. These aircraft are part of the Navy\u2019s 200 helicopter plan of record with deliveries beginning in early 2022. We anticipate production will continue beyond the 2030 timeframe providing long-term growth opportunities well into the future.","Sikorsky was also awarded the first LRIP contract for the VH-92A Presidential helicopter. This $540 million order follows an affirmative milestone C decision this past May and includes the first 6 aircraft of the total 23 unit plan of record. Sikorsky has been producing helicopters to transport every U.S. President and Commander-in-Chief since Dwight D. Eisenhower and we are proud to build on this heritage to deliver this remarkable product for years to come. These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy products and services as well as the demand for new solutions and platforms that are coming online. Our heritage of investment and innovation and operational performance has positioned us well to perform for our customers and drive future growth.","Moving briefly to defense budgets, it was announced yesterday that the President and the House and Senate leadership have reached a broad agreement on FY \u201820 National Defense Funding proposing spending levels that would be a compromise between the DoD request and the House Bills that have been approved and would represent an increase from the current FY \u201819 enacted values. Importantly, this agreement supports removing the restrictions placed on defense spending by the 2011 Budget Control Act caps for both FY \u201820 and FY \u201821 fiscal years. This action once passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law would remove the prospect of automatic spending reductions known as sequestration and raise the final 2 years of budget ceilings, providing crucial near-term funding visibility for our national security objectives. We will await the details of this bipartisan action. We believe this is an encouraging step in the process to continue to provide the support for the recapitalization of our national defense assets and the investment in our country\u2019s defense.","Moving on I would like to just highlight several significant events that occurred across the Corporation during the past quarter. First, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to our F-35 organization for being part of the automatic ground collision avoidance system, or Auto GCAS team that was awarded the 2018 Robert J. Collier Trophy in April. The Collier Trophy is presented annually to recognize the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. This award celebrated the Auto GCAS team, a collaborative group from industry and government, including the Air Force, the F-35 Joint Program Office, NASA, the Defense Safety Council and our Lockheed Martin F-35 organization for successfully completing a rapid design and implementation of life saving technologies for the worldwide F-35 fleet. This system improves the safety of aircraft in pilots using a set of complex collision avoidance and autonomous decision-making algorithms, pushing the boundaries of autonomy and artificial intelligence. This technology has already been credited for 7 F-16 sales and the F-35 enterprise accelerated the implementation of the software 7 years ahead of schedule. Lockheed Martin companies and employees, including Glenn L. Martin and Kelly Johnson have won or been part of the winning team for this prestigious honor over a dozen times since the first Collier Trophy was awarded in 1911. And I am extremely proud that our F-35 team again joins this distinguished group of innovators.","Moving to Missiles and Fire Control, our tactical and strike missile line of business achieved this key milestone this quarter on the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW hypersonic missile program. In June, our team and the U.S. Air Force successfully completed a captive carry flight test of the ARRW weapon on the service of the B-52 Stratofortress bomber mounting the missile below the aircraft\u2019s wings to gather data on drag and vibrations. The ARRW missile successfully passed the preliminary design review in March, and this captive carry test is the most recent step in the Air Force\u2019s rapid prototyping strategy to mature this hypersonic weapon.","In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team celebrated a key milestone with the first flight of our combat rescue helicopter, the latest rotorcraft designed to perform critical search and rescue operations for the U.S. Air Force. This aircraft based on the venerable UH-60M Black Hawk provides a significant increase in capabilities from previous rescue helicopters with extended range, more effective defensive systems, cyber security and weaponry that all lead to improved survivability. The program continues to be on schedule and this successful first flight paves the way for a Milestone C decision later this year to move the platform from the development phase into production. The program of record calls for 113 of these modernized aircrafts. And we look forward to providing this crucial rescue helicopter to help ensure the air force fulfills its mission to leave no one behind.","I will close with our space business area, whose Orion team took another remarkable step in returning astronauts to the moon with their successful demonstration of a crucial launch safety system, which completed just after the close of the quarter. Orion is part of the backbone for our nation\u2019s plan for deep space exploration and NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024. Lockheed Martin Space, the prime contractor producing Orion spacecraft for NASA designed and built the state-of-the-art escape system to safely pull the crew module and astronauts away from a life threatening event during the launch. In this event known as the Ascent Abort Flight test, the vehicle rose to an altitude of 3,100 feet where it experienced the high stressed aerodynamic conditions expected during early flight and within milliseconds, the Abort system initiated a series of maneuvers that propelled the test version of the Orion capsule away from the rocket and into a safe descent. This test marks an important milestone as the nation celebrates the 50th anniversary of man\u2019s first lunar landing and now prepares for a return of human space flight. We are proud to continue our legacy in space exploration by supporting the Orion program and delivering the safest spacecraft ever built.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ken. Ken?","Ken Possenriede","Thanks, Marillyn and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today.","Let\u2019s begin with Chart 3 in an overview of our results for the quarter. We exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the second quarter carrying forward the strong performance from the first quarter. After generating $1.7 billion of cash from operations, we have returned over $840 million to our stockholders in the quarter. We also achieved another quarter of record backlog totaling $137 billion. And based on another strong quarter\u2019s results, we have increased our outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the year. We are very pleased with our results as we progress into the second half of 2019.","On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year\u2019s second quarter results. Sales grew 8% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.4 billion while segment operating profit increased 6% over last year\u2019s level to $1.6 billion.","On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for second quarter by business areas compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. As shown, all the business areas experienced growth again this quarter. And as Marillyn highlighted, missiles and fire control and space experienced the highest growth in the quarter with 16% and 11% respectively. Both business areas recognized growth in their hypersonic programs. In addition, missiles and fire control sales growth also included volume on classified business and precision fires and space also saw volume increases on next-gen OPIR and GPS government satellite programs. Rotary and mission systems had 6% growth driven by multiple programs that are IWSS line of business but partially offset by Sikorsky primarily due to lower volume. Aeronautics had 4% growth driven by timing on the F-35 program, and I\u2019ll note the F-35 program is tracking ahead of the year-to-date plan. On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in second quarter 2019, versus our results in second quarter 2018. Segment operating profit was up again this quarter compared with last year results in each business area. And here, Missiles and Fire Control had the largest increase in operating profit; 17% higher than last year, primarily driven by the volume I just discussed.","Space increased operating profit by 5% mainly due to risk retirements on AEHF and volume on government satellite programs. This increase was partially offset by lower ULA equity earnings. ARRW and RMS grew operating profit by 3% and 2% respectively. ARRW was volume driven by both F-35 production and our Skunk Works business. ","In RMS at higher risk retirements and volume at IWSS, this was partially offset by a charge taken at our training and logistic solutions business.","Turning to Chart 7, we\u2019ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5 was 23% higher than our results last year driven by a few items. First, the quarterly volume drove higher segment operating profit. In addition, it reflects the higher FAS\/CAS benefit and lower tax rate, including additional tax deductions for the foreign derived intangible income or FDII that we also experienced in the first quarter of 2019.","Turning to Chart 8, we\u2019ll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $1.4 billion. We returned nearly 60% of our free cash flow to our stockholders in the quarter between dividends and share repurchases.","And as I mentioned, we are increasing the full year cash from operations outlook from greater than or equal to $7.5 billion to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion with another quarter of strong performance. We are on track for our continued investment in the business through capital expenditures of $1.7 billion planned for the year, which as usual is proportionately higher in the second half of the year.","For the full year, we are progressing toward our cash deployment goals. Chart 9 provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $1.5 billion based on higher expectations for all our business areas for the rest of the year. This increase in sales was driven by strong backlog across all our businesses. Three of the four business areas had an increase in backlog again this quarter. This outlook takes us to an impressive 10% year-over-year sales growth expectation and as a reminder, our January guidance for the year was 5% sales growth. We are also increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $225 million due to the higher sales volume across all four business areas.","And comparable to sales, our segment operating profit outlook is up 9% year-over-year and as a reference point, our January guidance was above 3%. There is no change to our net FAS\/CAS adjustment. We are increasing our earnings per share expectations by $0.80. I will provide more detail on this increase on the next chart. And for cash from operations, we are increasing our outlook by another $100 million to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion. ","Chart 10 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. The vast majority of the increase is driven by our operational performance and volume. This results in a $0.66 increase in our EPS. The remaining $0.14 improvement in EPS is driven by a lower estimated effective tax rate from approximately 15.5% to 15% for the year. These items result in a total increase of $0.80 and a new EPS outlook of $20.85 to $21.15. ","On chart 11, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. As I discussed on a prior chart, we increased our sales outlook in all of our business areas. An increase of $65 million at Space, $350 million at RMS, $300 million at Aeronautics and $200 million for missiles and Fire Control, totaling an increase of $1.5 billion above the outlook we provided on our last call.","Chart 12 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. Consistent with our sales outlook, each business segment increased their operating profit for the year. Space by $140 million, Missiles and Fire Control by $40 million, $25 million for ARRW and $20 million for RMS, totaling to an increase of $225 million above last quarter\u2019s outlook.","And finally on Chart 13 we have our summary. We continued with another quarter in 2019 with strong operational financial performance across our portfolio. We see strength in our backlog for near-term and long-term growth prospects across all of our business areas. And based on the results of the quarter, we increased our full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And with that, we\u2019re ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Ken.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Peter Arment","So Marillyn, on the F-35 and the impact from Turkey being dropped from the program, you mentioned the production lots 12 to 14 only include roughly 8 units per year. So the questions really are \u2013 can those units to be absorbed by other partners in the program? And secondly, removing Turkey from the F-35 supply chain certainly seems more complicated, given the numerous parts that they supply. So, how quickly can those components be produced or transferred to other suppliers and do you anticipate any temporary slowdown on production? Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Peter. I know this is a \u2013 a lot of questions around this. But I want to just start by saying that it is a pretty fluid situation, but one in which we\u2019ve been engaged with the Department of Defense for a number of months. Close to a year at looking at challenges you see on this program because there have been indications that there were discussions under way. So it\u2019s clearly a government matter. As I mentioned, we\u2019re going to always follow with the official guidance\u2019s of the US government. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had a lot of discussions with the Department of Defense on that. In terms of your first question about could those eight per year in the next three lots in 12, 13 and 14 by \u2013 be absorbed by others? Yes, they could. As you know, there have been additional countries that have expressed interest outside Poland, for example, they just most recently said they\u2019d like to purchase 32 and they are in a process right now of moving through that process for their develop of request an agreement. There are other countries that have clearly indicated that they want more. We mentioned Japan in the past and others. So I don\u2019t see that as a big challenge for us to absorb them. We are \u2013 we continue to ramp up production. Related to your question on the supply chain we have been working on this for a number of months, of looking at what could potentially be the impact, making sure that we could mitigate the risk associated with the parts that are produced in Turkey. And so, we have a very good mitigation plan. Discontinuing their participation certainly would impact the supply chain posture across production sustainment to some extent. And so because of that, we\u2019ve been working on it and the F-35 enterprise, the JPO, Lockheed Martin, all of our suppliers are fully confident in the strength and stability of the program and we are working \u2013 we\u2019ve been working to wind down the Turkish industry involvement. And so we have a \u2013 we have a timeline that we\u2019re working toward. As you\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s out through March of 2020 that we think it will all be resolved. And I think we\u2019re \u2013 and because we addressed it, it\u2019s been percolating for a while and we addressed it early, and have been working closely with the Pentagon and even they have requested reprogramming dollars out of Congress to support it. We\u2019re very much comfortable that we\u2019re on a good path to mitigate any risks to the program.","Ken Possenriede","Hey, Peter. This is Ken. The only thing I would say is we have worked very closely with the Joint Program Office, and if there is any harm to industry, we will be compensated for that. So we\u2019re working very closely with them that could \u2013 regarding cost schedule or any payment terms, we are \u2013 we will be fully compensated for that, which is obviously a good thing.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, Greg and Ken, roll tide, Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just 30 days to go, you know, so got to get excited. One question, you talked a lot about hypersonics in your prepared remarks, obviously with the proposed M&A activity in the space that\u2019s been more topical and I think there\u2019s been a good bit of disclosure about what programs are out there in recent months. And so, I just wondered you guys have positions on several of these development prototype efforts, but when do you think we see real programs of record? How should we think about the timing and the service leadership around that, what do we think \u2013 how are you thinking about that? What\u2019s the future look like from a real sustainable program of record standpoint?","Ken Possenriede","Hey, Carter, it\u2019s Ken. And for the record, I did not go to Alabama. But since my \u2013","Carter Copeland","That\u2019s OK. We like you, we like you all the same.","Ken Possenriede","Since my boss is sitting across the table for me, I\u2019ll say roll tide. So, you know, you\u2019re right. We have done a nice job of working with the customer set, whether it\u2019s the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, DARPA. As Marillyn mentioned, we\u2019ve got $3.5 billion of contracts that are either in our backlog or will soon be in our backlog. It\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re generating sales. They are in \u2013 all these programs are in the development, the prototype phase of their program, you\u2019ll start seeing first launch prototype launches starting next year on most of these programs, some of these programs actually have scope that is to prepare for production doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to go into production. But I think once these things are either deemed successful or not in the prototype, the development phase, once we get past first launch, then I think it will be the time for that customer set to sit with us, to see if it makes sense to go into production and that\u2019s probably, say two years out would be our best guess. So you will see this year and next year and into 2021 us continue to perform on these programs from a prototype development standpoint. Perhaps shape a couple of more programs and get a few more in our backlog, but production won\u2019t happen for the next couple of years.","Operator","And next we go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Ken, overall can you explain, I mean you raised sales growth by $2.5 billion for the year and a lot of your business is fairly long cycle. I mean there\u2019s some shorter cycle businesses. But can you explain why it would get raised that much or is it just the prior CFO giving a pretty conservative numbers to work with? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","So everybody is on a roll today. Thanks. Thanks, George. You know, actually if you look at our order book, and if you put aside, we assumed we would get the block buy order in the second quarter. Definitization for lot 12 and lot 13, that did not happen. If you put that aside for the year, we\u2019re beating our orders plan by $11 billion and those, some of those are pull ahead. So think of the AWE order that we got, it was for three years. So we\u2019re not getting many sales this year for that order. There are some orders this year that frankly were pull-ins or were orders that we did not expect. There were a few in F-35, we\u2019ve got some follow-on modernization contracts and some sustainment contracts we did not expect. In fact Space is having the strongest year from an order book standpoint, a lot of those are in Mission Systems. There was some Orion work we did not expect, and that is why you\u2019ve seen the increase in guidance for Space being as robust as it is. So roughly, that $1.5 billion, a lot of that is still in front of us in the third and the fourth quarter and a lot of that is for frankly front end orders we got this year. Also remind you that we got the OPIR contract late last year. CSC the Canadian Surface Combatant of RMS and GPS III in late last year. Those programs, especially since Space has talked about \u2013 the agency has talked about go fast, we are \u2013 we taking them by their word and we are going fast and we\u2019ve accelerated sales. And so a lot of it is order book from late last year and the increase in orders we got in the first half of this year. We\u2019ve done very well there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Marillyn, the recently announced plan to merge between Raytheon and United Technologies has brought up a lot of discussion about scale. And I think that kind of sounds to a lot of people, scale sounds like short hand for being bigger in order to absorb more development risk. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 that can be a cause of concern for investors since the industry is disciplined over the past ten or 15 years, I think it\u2019s something that investors have applauded and come to appreciate. And so, given that there seems to be more discussion on scale, do you find Lockheed having to rely more on scale as you go out in search of opportunities? And are you seeing others behave any differently?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, it\u2019s great question, Seth. I would just say that, I think for us, our scale is an advantage for us because it gives us the opportunity to invest more in research and development. I think that\u2019s true when you look across our industry, it allows us to reach out to small and medium-sized businesses and to maybe take in fact, we increased our Ventures Fund, so that we could spend more in that arena. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019ve increased our IRAD expenditure, Independent Research and Development over the last few years. So I think, just by the nature of the size of our Corporation and the financial performance of our Corporation that we\u2019ve been able to invest more in research and development. An example would be, a lot of the wins that we\u2019ve had in hypersonics. I mean, that\u2019s an area we\u2019ve been investing in for a number of years, or directed energy autonomy, a lot of those areas is because we have been able to invest in things that we\u2019re looking at beyond today, not just on what we need to invest to keep our current portfolio relevant. I mean as we look at Raytheon and United Technology\u2019s merger, I mean we\u2019ll continue to monitor that transaction, their progresses and evaluate what that impact might be for Lockheed Martin. But I think we\u2019re very well positioned in, in terms of where we are investing, and I think just seeing our financial performance this year and increasing our outlook in terms of sales for the year and where we\u2019re taking the business, I think that just demonstrates that. So hopefully that answered your question. Anything you want to add, Ken?","Ken Possenriede","The only other thing I\u2019d add Seth is, we do have a very robust, I will call it corporate development process, which includes everything that Marillyn talked about including divestitures and M&A. In fact, we meet with Marillyn, and the head of our corporate strategy lead on a monthly basis to review that and also to review exactly what you just described the \u2013 what impact will the scale of UTC have on us, UTC Raytheon have on us, and we\u2019re still sorting that out.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Safran","Marillyn, Ken, Greg, good morning, how are you?","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning. Well. Thanks.","Richard Safran","So I was very interested in your opening remarks on the F-35 and pricing and I think it\u2019s been a while since you spoke about the F-35 margins. So I wanted to ask you a couple of things about that. First, and always to the best you can, could you discuss how much of an improvement in margins you\u2019re expecting on LRIP 12 and the new handshake deal that you\u2019re going to finalize? I realize things are still fluid there. Also in your answer, if possible, could you contrast margins on the production program with margins on the sustainment business? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","Good bet Rich and I\u2019ll take that. So you\u2019re right. The ink is not yet dry on, on the Block Buy contract yet, but we\u2019re still going through that and we\u2019re hopeful in the third quarter, we\u2019ll have that lot 12 and 13 definitized. Regarding pricing, we have \u2013 we have, I think done a nice job with the joint program office on this contract demonstrating where we think costs are going. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our supply chain in terms of driving down costs and ensuring they still got value from the program from a profitability standpoint. And you\u2019re right it is early, but the deal we think we\u2019ve signed, its two parts of a profit. It\u2019s a base fee, and part of that base fee is a supplier incentive fees that we are going to receive. And that is ensuring that the quality of the work being done and also the price of the work done by our supply chain will if we hit those targets, we will be incentivized for that. The second piece is very similar to Lot 11. We\u2019re going to get a performance incentive fee and that\u2019s based on the final assembly on Lot 12 and then made on Lot 13 and 14 and we feel really good about those targets going forward and we do think if we perform, we have an opportunity to improve margins on Lot 12 through 14, relative to previous lots and part of that is the fee arrangement that we have, that incentivizes us on good performance, plus we\u2019re comfortable with the cost targets that we have for our internal costs and our supply chain. Regarding sustainment and production, we\u2019re seeing production is probably going to be higher in the future compared to sustainment. There would be one thing that could potentially impact that if we can work with the customer to get some type of PBL contract that incentivizes us to reduce cost and availability that, that potentially could help. But just based on the mix of programs on sustainment between cost plus and fixed price compared to production, which is all fixed price, we\u2019ll see higher margins on production going forward.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning, Marillyn. Good morning, Ken.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Marillyn, a question for you. Just coming back to some of your prepared comments around the budget and being able to get a two-year deal. Can you talk about what sort of revenue visibility that gives you and maybe how far out you can now go and then and this part might be for Ken, any implications on the capex side? I mean, having that sort of visibility at this point in time, does that put upward or downward pressure based on everything that you\u2019re seeing today?","Marillyn Hewson","So. Rajeev, I think you know, talking about budgets maybe gives us a better sense of what our customers will have in terms of where they would make their decisions, we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out in terms of what that means for Lockheed Martin. I mean, for the current budget negotiations, it appears that our programs are well supported. But again, we\u2019ll just have to wait until Congress gets through its process and closing on that. So, I can\u2019t really give you a revenue projection around that. The best thing we can do is what we\u2019re giving you in our outlook today and we\u2019re right now in our planning process that we do annually of looking what it\u2019s going to look like in the next coming years. So, we\u2019ll continue to do that. The one thing I would point to for you is the strong backlog, we have. $137 billion backlog gives you, should give you a sense of a very strong performance for us in the next few years. And then, the upside we\u2019ll see as we win more programs and build that backlog is an indication on revenue growth for us. We are very much focused on a strategy of long-term growth and continue to think that not only our portfolio of products we have today are well supported by both the U.S. and our international customers, but beyond that, we\u2019re investing in areas that we think are going to be in demand in the future. So, I feel very good about our growth prospects, but I can\u2019t really make a direct connection between what the budget negotiations are on Capitol Hill versus what our revenue growth is.","Ken Possenriede","Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add on that and then I\u2019ll get to the capital question is, you look at the budgets that are out there and what some of the sound bites are. It does play nicely into our portfolio. So, we do feel good about that and as Marillyn mentioned, we\u2019re excited to start seeing the business areas come in and show us their long-range plan in the next quarter, and we\u2019ll give you some color on that in the October call. Regarding capex, we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve had we\u2019re stronger than in capital expenditures than we have been historically and we\u2019ll see that for the next couple of years and a lot of that is driven by the recent wins we had in Palmdale. So, we\u2019re building new buildings out in Palmdale for some of the classified wins that we have and I will note that, that big classified job we won last year we did get the second customer order this year, which is great news. So that\u2019s progressing as we like. We talked about Missiles and Fire Control, the ramp on production, that will continue and we\u2019re continuing to see strong demand there. So, there\u2019ll be a strong capital requirement there and at Space, we\u2019re continuing to finish up our gateway program. So, it will be around the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion of capex probably for the next couple of years. So that\u2019s the best line of sight we have today.","Operator","Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks, good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","David Strauss","I want to ask about the working capital build that you\u2019ve seen year-to-date pretty significant, and based on the free cash flow for current operating cash flow forecast for the full year it doesn\u2019t appear like you\u2019re assuming that any of that kind of comes off through the rest of the year. Can you talk about that? And then also the potential, you know, how you\u2019re thinking about the pension contributions that you\u2019ve talked about in 2021 and potentially pull that forward into 2019? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","You bet. You\u2019re right. So, we have had some working capital growth in the first half of the year primarily in inventory and in unbilled receivables or contract assets. The thing I would say though is, we have grown the first half of the year very, very strong relative to where we were on December 31st. So, we think we\u2019re doing the working capital build in a smart way. We do see a strong cash generation in the second half of the year and then going into next year, so we do have a concerted effort to reduce our unbilled inventory, reduce the inventory that\u2019s on the balance sheet in the second half of the year and then going into next year. And we\u2019ve always said that would happen to just pick, isolate and pick Sikorsky, we\u2019ll start having those development programs start going into production programs in the next couple of years. So, we will see our working capital come down in a significant way in the next couple of years. Regarding pensions, the best line of sight we have today is, so interest rates are down 75 basis points from where we thought they would be, and we\u2019ve talked about our long-term asset growth of 7%. We are close to 12% year to date. I know the year is not over. So, if you look at those two variables right now, we\u2019ll go through the planning process in the next couple of months, but right now we see a pension contribution of about $500 million next year and then $2 billion in 2021 and probably another $2 billion in 2022. We will go through a financial review later this year and we\u2019ll look at the timing of those pension contributions, whether it makes sense to pull them forward and that will have to be relative to some of the debt obligations that we have in 2020 and 2021. So, we\u2019ll sort that all out in the next couple of months.","Operator","And next we have Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Yes, good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Doug Harned","You know, I wanted to go back to the F-35 and margins, because you made some real progress here with reaching the $80 million target early. If we look forward, when I think of combat aircraft programs like this, you want to be up at that kind of eventually 13% 14% type margin level. So, when you look forward, and this program matures, do you expect it to get up to those kinds of levels, and then, what kind of timeframe is reasonable?","Ken Possenriede","Yes, Doug. So, I gave you color on I gave you color on Lot 12 to 14. So, we\u2019ll hit Milestone C on F-35 soon, and we\u2019ll hopefully start converting these FPI contracts to firm fixed price contracts. And that then will give us the opportunity to recoup more of the underruns than for the contracts we have today. So basically, today the overruns are capped just like a fixed price contract, but we are sharing in the underruns and on a few of these programs we have been fortunate where we have underrun and we\u2019ve been sharing that with the United States government. So, I think it would be going forward, it would be beyond the Block Buy, and it would have to be starting when we start getting into multi-year. So, Lot 15 and beyond would be the opportunity for us to get up in to the to the 13th. And we would do our 13% we would do everything we can to make that happen, and make sure it\u2019s still a fair deal for our customers as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Hi. Good afternoon. Ken, I think, Bruce a couple of years ago talked about kind of the three-year revenue growth goal. And I think that\u2019s obviously changed a little bit. So, can you maybe just revisit just given how strong this year has been, kind of what the framework should be for next year, revenue growth? And then what your ability is in a couple of years to offset some of these pension contributions with better working capital and that type of thing? Thank you.","Ken Possenriede","Thanks, Joe. Yes. So, I we really don\u2019t have a visibility yet into next year, and you\u2019re right we\u2019ve much stronger growth, the good news is backlog is much stronger as well. So, we need to see the timing of that burn down of backlog and we won\u2019t have that visibility for another for another two months and I will, I promise give you that color on the October call. Just going forward, if you look at where we\u2019re going, from a pension standpoint, we do see line of sight out in the 2026 time period where you hopefully you recall we are freezing our pension for the most part, totally by the end of the year and we do see line of sight in \u201820 the end of this year, excuse me, a line of sight in the 2026, 2027 time period where we will be making a modest pension contributions generally for bargaining arrangements that we have. So, it will be out in that time period where we\u2019ll be able to do that. And just to recall, if you look at our CAS recoveries, our CAS recoveries out for the next couple of years are going to be around $2.5 billion and as I mentioned earlier, our pension contributions as we see them today in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 time period are likely to be around $2 billion, but even going farther out as our CAS recoveries go down, they will still be higher than our pension contributions in 2026, 2027 time period.","And that should be able to offset working capital to potentially fund the pension plan. So, yes, that potentially could happen.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Yeah, good morning guys.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Pete Skibitski","Just thinking about the continuation of potential continuation of this great growth we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few years guys at Missiles and the Fire control, I think you\u2019re still spending growth capex in Arkansas, you\u2019ve got some of these hypersonic wins and I think that you\u2019ve also got this, I think pretty big competitive take away in AIM-260 program. So, can you talk about the visibility that you do have that Missiles given there are some strategic priority type programs in that segment and offset by maybe some really tough comps? Just maybe talk about some of the visibility you have there. Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","You bet. So, you know, talking to Missiles and Fire Control and they talking to their customer, and I was actually being in the room with them at times. We see strong growth still across their portfolio. So, if you look at Hellfire, I mean you mentioned, Pete, you mentioned you\u2019re spot on, there is still continued capital growth there and it is bought in by the United States government, they understand what we\u2019re doing and fully support it. You will see us in Hellfire go from roughly 8,000 units, up to 11,000 units. We see line of sight of that. GMLRS from 6,000 to 10,000, ATACMS up to 500, JASSM will see significant growth, PAD will continue to see significant growth and I\u2019m sure you saw the big order we got this year from KSA. So, we do see continued demand with THAAD. PAC-3, 350 to 500. In fact, Missiles and Fire Control has heard from their customer set that if we could build 750, they and the international customers would take them. So, we do see very, very strong demand for the next couple of years with Missiles and Fire Control. In fact, they will likely be the fastest growing business area of the Lockheed Martin portfolio for the next couple of years.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Hi. Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Ron Epstein","I just wanted to follow up on Sikorsky. Looking at where the business is performing today, how is it performing relative to where you thought it would be when the deal was done?","Ken Possenriede","So, Ron, good morning. So, we\u2019re pleased with how Sikorsky is performing. You have a strong performance with the Black Hawk programs. We just as Marillyn mentioned in her prepared remarks, we got LRIP 2 and 3 with on CH-53K. We\u2019re happy with that performance. We\u2019re trying to shape a deal in India for the MH-60. We have a lot of international demand there. Generally speaking, we\u2019re pleased with the cost take out that we did at Sikorsky, how we integrated them into RMS. Some of the production programs have slipped to the right, understandable, I mean, normal development things that happen, but I\u2019d say on the whole, we\u2019re very pleased with the performances of Sikorsky. We talked about the working capital growth earlier. A lot of that working capital growth is at Sikorsky and it will burn down over the next couple of years. We are trying to shape a couple of new business wins that we feel good about that, the FARA, which is the medium lift helicopter. We feel good about that going forward and then FARA which is the light lift helicopter, we feel good about that. So, on the whole, we\u2019re pleased with where things are going.","Marillyn Hewson","The only thing I would add Ron here is that we there\u2019s been a little bit of a disappointment, but it\u2019s such a small element of the portfolio. It has it\u2019s been offset by all those growth opportunities that you highlighted Ken with the commercial. We have been challenged in our commercial oil and gas area that\u2019s well known it\u2019s, it hasn\u2019t come back and I think that\u2019s true across the industry. But that\u2019s a small element of portfolio, it\u2019s has been very well offset by the growth opportunities we\u2019ve seen on Sikorsky.","Ken Possenriede","And to the point I make there is, and I think we highlighted this Bruce did that, we discounted a lot of that going forward, but you\u2019re right, that would have been nice upside if the market turned.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Hi, good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Rob Spingarn","I wanted Ken, going back to your point on not having line of sight so much into the years, I\u2019m just curious was this higher level of wins in the first half at any level of pull forward of awards you might have expected later this year and next year? Are these mostly market share gains, like example AIM-260 or hypersonics, etcetera, if you could just talk to that a little bit. And then Marillyn if you could speak perhaps to why you are winning some market share there, in especially in the missile side?","Ken Possenriede","You bet, Rob. You know, as I mentioned earlier, we are ahead of our we\u2019re beating, we\u2019re going to beat our plan this year by about $11 billion. You know, I\u2019d say, Rob, it\u2019s probably half pull aheads and half things that we\u2019ve shaped with our customers that were not in our plan.","So, you mentioned hypersonics, on the whole, most of those awards were not in our plan, and just to give you a little color, we\u2019re going to probably book about $600 million of sales in hypersonics this year. And then the rest of that $3.5 billion would go into the next two years as I mentioned earlier. AWE, the two additional years would be a pull ahead. The Aeronautics for the most part was, our upside, they were not pull aheads. A lot of the other space programs were upside, so Orion, additional scope is upside. The mission solution\u2019s work is new scope. We had a new order for an international customer for our SOF S-70i program. So, I\u2019d say on the whole, about half pull aheads and half shaping by us to win new programs.","Marillyn Hewson","And then to your question about why, why do you think we\u2019re winning market share? I would just say that we have put innovation and investment in extending our products and investing in new products as the priority in this company. I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 we know that, that\u2019s where we bring value to our customers. And so it\u2019s long running investments that we have been making into the programs that are coming to fruition that allows us to win. For example, hypersonics is a great example of that, a lot of the work that we have been doing in that for a number of years. Directed Energy is another example. These are areas that \u2013 and even on our current portfolio as we look at extended ranges like PAC-3 MSE or we look at other opportunities that we can do to invest and even in our current portfolio is what allows us. And then I think the key thing is that we have got a very talented team of folks that are always focused on performance and performing on the work we have sets us up well, be able to win new business, because we can invest in affordability, we can invest in innovation to bring that value.","Greg Gardner","Okay. John, this is Greg. I think we have kind of on the top of the hour here. So I will turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Greg. So let me just conclude the call today by again reiterating that our second quarter results and our increased 2019 outlook reflect our commitment to our strategy of growth and operational excellence, because we are going to continue to deliver long-term value creation for our stockholders and innovative solutions for our customers. So once again, we thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you on our next earnings call in October. John, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry Kircher","Thank you, Abigail, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016. ","As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally. The Corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos. ","Turning to the quarter. Our team continued to deliver broad based results across the Corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. ","Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our Corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. ","I would also note that share repurchases year to date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares and this lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. ","This longstanding goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by a stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our Corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunities. ","For the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high level perspective on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process.","We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain where multiple business areas procure similar materials have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the Corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition. ","Moving to an operational perspective. Significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the US Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase.","Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the US Navy for long lead items required for the first two CH-53K helicopters on low rate initial production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years. ","In the area of commercial helicopters, we're seeing some emerging interest from other customers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms and we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments.","We also see a significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut, that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers\u2019 aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.","Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending. strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. ","We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.","Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first Transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the US to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. ","And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operational capability of CTOL aircraft to US Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.","I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. ","In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in a special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58 which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. ","We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better than expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.","On chart 4 we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of MST for about $1 billion -- and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries.","Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS, as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and integration costs.","On chart 5, we will discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter we are right on track to our plan level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.","If you will turn to chart 6, we will provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We are increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share and I will discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.","Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS while the $100 million special charge associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.","On chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other four business areas at this time.","Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in four of our five business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million.","And finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. We continue to provide significant cash returns to our stockowners and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.","With that, we are ready for questions, Abigail.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland ","Hey, good morning, Marillyn, Bruce. Good quarter. A couple of just quick ones on the margin. I noticed that the profit contribution from the C-130 that you called out on the $200 million and higher revenues is only $10 million and sort of implies a lower margin than we would think is normal for that. I wondered if there was a negative offset there? And then as a second one, in the guide I noted the sales in MFC have obviously been strong and benefited from I think some of the consumable stuff and some of the stuff you highlighted in the release. But the guidance didn't increase there and I wondered if there was again an offset to call out for the full year. Thank you.","Bruce Tanner ","Thanks, Carter, thanks for the question. So the first one I think was your margin contribution question relative to C-130. And you picked up right. I think we had a $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profit is what we called out I think on the earnings release. This is somewhat of what I talked about I think either in October or January where we are sort of finishing kind of an older, I would say, multi-year contract \u2013 it\u2019s more than a multiyear contract, but an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on. And it\u2019s at the tail end of that contract and we are starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits -- initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I have said all along, I still think the economics between the two contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical practice, we are starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense.","On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you are right. We did not increase for the year. We are watching that closely. I will just leave it that as we sit here in the first quarter didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We have seen some good signs particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables particularly with some of our Middle East customers. But I am watching this to see if it perhaps warrants something later on in the year, but not at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Doug Harned ","Thank you. I'd just like to follow up on the Missiles and Fire Control side, because you also in the release talked about it sounded like more a timing issue with contracts on missile defense, you referred to PAC-3. Can you talk about when you look at international contracts, particularly in the Middle East on missile defense, where you stand today in terms of the maturity of those programs? Because it appears you may be in some that are earlier stage and perhaps lower margin at this point than when they mature.","Bruce Tanner ","Doug, I will give that a shot. So I think the watch item in terms of the air missile defense programs for the Middle East are more in the orders expectation for this year rather than I will say the margin expectations. You should think of essentially all of international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the THAAD program are sort of combined with US orders. So they will perform essentially at parity with US orders over that period of time. There is not per se any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the US military portion of the order, if you will. And this again is somewhat akin to what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract where we are starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on in both PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we negotiated some new contracts and they are starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up.","Again, economically I'm not sure there is a whole lot of difference between the contracts, but sort of from a booking perspective that\u2019s the way that is playing out. But I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.","Richard Safran ","Thanks, good morning. I had a bit of a multipart question here on trying to get an update on the F-35 margin profile we should expect. So in 2016 I think you are north of about 8%. As you ramp up production and some of the low margin development work winds down, I want to know if you could comment on what the margin progression should be. How quickly do you think you can get to F-16 types of margins? And if you would, could you comment on F-35 sustainment and if that could drive upside to margins?","Bruce Tanner ","Hey Rich, I will take that one as well. So, F-35 margins are going to vary over time. I think from a big picture perspective we do expect them to increase sequentially year over year. We talked about last year being an expectation of a 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about again either October or January the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in 2017 and 2018 as we start to sort of progress to what you are describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is that by the time we get to full rate production the margins on the F-35 program look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera. ","So, I don't think that we are deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first-quarter results -- and I know I didn't talk about this last year -- we were actually close to 10% on the production program. So, it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation again is we will get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production.","Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production program. So it\u2019s not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly and we are going to start seeing some of the sustainment contract sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talking about sustainment separately from production. But you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi ","Bruce, I wonder if you could just talk about kind of Sikorsky performance relative to expectations at this point from a revenue and margin standpoint. And then also, just as you look into 2018, I think that\u2019s when the required contributions start again for the pensions. So just based on current assumptions can you talk about what the contribution could be in 2018?","Bruce Tanner ","Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say Sikorsky -- and look, we are still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I am still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That\u2019s both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We are sort of front end loaded during the year with these things I talked about in the last quarter's call, these customer lien rights that have sort of depressed the sales because of sales for products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter over quarter with the fourth quarter obviously being the highest quarter of the year. ","Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increased quarter over quarter, again obviously having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well. And this is again some of the timing of the customer lien rights in the first half of the year as well. So I\u2019d say just big picture, that\u2019s pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter, and we\u2019re going to watch it throughout the year, we\u2019ll give you updates as we go and progress through the rest of the year.","Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding. So we had described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a three year pension holiday \u2013 cash funding holidays I called it, I think and that was 2015, \u201916, \u201917, and unfortunately that holiday does stop at the end of 2017 and in 2018 we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think as we sit here today, Joe, that\u2019s probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn\u2019t think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say, $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion, and we\u2019re down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that\u2019s going to offset most but not all of that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it\u2019s somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn\u2019t think of as sort of falling off the cliff from 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ron Epstein ","Good morning. Can you just walk through the laundry list of upcoming competitions that we should keep an eye on? I mean, we all kind of know Trainer [ph] is happening and maybe you can make some commentary on that. But what\u2019s on that list of stuff we should keep our eyes out for?","Bruce Tanner ","Hi Ron, this is Bruce. Did you say competitions or just bigger awards coming up or do you \u2013","Ron Epstein ","No, competitions, yes, competitions, right. So we have got Trainer and what else do we have on the horizon? ","Bruce Tanner ","You know, there is not a whole lot of \u2013 I\u2019ll say large dollar strategic competitions coming up, even Trainer is likely going to be -- the decision is likely going to happen in 2017 as opposed to 2016. Another large one that we are watching is JSTARS, but that\u2019s probably not a 2016 decision either. Most -- frankly most of the -- I will say the strategic competitions that I think is at the heart of your questions would probably not be in 2016. I mean these are things like long range -- or the LRSO competition, the TBMD -- GSBD, excuse me ground strategic ballistic deterrent. But those are probably \u201817 and even beyond as far as the real big pick of strategic items. And beyond that, I mean the one we are watching obviously closely, which I wouldn't characterize as a competition, but MEADS in Germany is one that we are hoping to close perhaps at the latter part of the year. And I'll let Marillyn add some color to what I've just said.","Marillyn Hewson ","The only other ones I would say that we are watching are some of our international partners making their decision on F-35 buys. So Denmark is coming -- they are going through their process and Canada will ultimately. But we think the best choice for them is F-35, but they will go through their process for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn ","Good morning. I wanted to ask really a two part question on IS&GS if I could. First, I think as you both stated, the business is doing a little better than perhaps you guided for and you have tweaked up the guidance there. So wanted to talk about whether that is just timing on some of these program closeouts or pricing environment which I think you cited pressure in. Maybe it\u2019s little better than expected. ","And then separately, Marillyn, the deal was contemplated I think on what the business will look like at the time of transaction. But of course that\u2019s a nine-month period. And so, from the time of announcement, how do we think about some of the puts and takes and strategic things that you are doing with regard to headcount vis-\u00e0-vis that new management team? Are these things that were negotiated? How do we think about that? Thank you.","Bruce Tanner ","Well, let me take the first part of that question, sort of the IS&GS performance. And I will say I mean obviously we increased the outlook for both sales and profit. So it\u2019s exceeded our expectations. I think there is a couple of things going on and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict what -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretch out of those. We are sort of seeing all those happen at the same time.","The one thing I am really pleased with probably more than anything, even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, that\u2019s a little bit hard to call, is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write off on an international contract. And even with that write off we still exceeded our expectations and we still, as obviously we said earlier, increased our guidance for the year. I think that\u2019s sort of due to three reasons, at least as I look at it sort of big picture wise. ","One, we had expected a number of re-compete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these, we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent. And because these contracts are actually being protested we are continuing the performance on the older contracts which are at the -- if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent contract. So it\u2019s good for us from both a sales perspective and more importantly on the margin side because of that.","I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time. We are actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations which are resulting in higher margins.","And then the third thing I would just say is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team. And I think credit goes to that team. I think it\u2019s indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It\u2019s a well-run organization and the entire team understands that the mission that they perform for their customers is important no matter who they work for. And I think we are seeing that play out live and in person in front of us here. I will ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Robert.","Marillyn Hewson ","Yes, I will pick up on the second part where you asked about at the time of transaction how to think about some of the puts and takes and the headcount and how we think about it. First, I just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean this is a management team that\u2019s running a business. They have outlined some commitments for the year and they are performing the commitments and the whole entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So, as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in it is ultracompetitive. And it\u2019s an area that you have got to constantly be watching your cost and you have to manage to that.","There is close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly we have an agreement as we are going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we are going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It\u2019s in all of our best interest and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that\u2019s working that every day.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.","David Strauss ","A couple questions within one, I guess. First, can you talk about only six F-35s that were delivered in the quarter? Was that your plan or was that actually below your plan? And then on Sikorsky, can you talk about -- it looks like MST that you are guiding for fairly flat EBIT from here through the rest of the year. But I would think, as you have commented, Sikorsky is expected to get better. And whether you are still tracking a plan for Sikorsky as a neutral to earnings in 2017? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner ","Thanks, David, good questions. So the six F-35s probably a little lighter than we expected and there is probably three or four different reasons for that. But none of them that will play out I think. By the time we get to the end of the second quarter I think we will be back on track at the end of the second quarter. And we are very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. Some of it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side there is no issue there, it was more of a, I'll say not quite administrative but not a production issue there.","You talked about Sikorsky within MST and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That\u2019s what we are showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that\u2019s one that we are still watching closely. It\u2019s a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we have got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the three quarters of the year you'd kind of come to that conclusion I think as well.","And then lastly I think the Sikorsky -- you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That\u2019s still our expectation, David, is that will be neutral going into 2017 with all of the pluses and minuses going into that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter Arment ","Bruce, a question on kind of just big picture on the backlog. You closed in 2015 at a record level and then we had a little bit of a downtick here this quarter, I guess timing related. On IS&GS you are going to lose that. Is there a number that we kind of should be looking for, for where you think backlog ends up at the end of the year? And then just, Marillyn, if I could -- related to that, how are you looking at kind of the international front? We have seen a healthy drop in oil over the last 18 months. We haven't seen a big impact on your awards, but just seeing if you are seeing any behavioral changes. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner ","So, Peter, I will answer the backlog question. So, we were down in the quarter after the record backlog at the end of last year. Actually we were ahead of plan in the first quarter, I think a couple billion dollars worth or so. So that may not be apparent; even though it was down, it was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing, we are going to have probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year, at least as we see it, the orders this year. We are probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year and that\u2019s sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35 and that\u2019s worth a significant amount of money.","Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS' disposition we could actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number it\u2019s probably going to be somewhere between $90 billion and -- low $90 billion to $95 billion by year end is the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about almost $4.5 billion or so, $5 billion drop, steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix. And when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level.","Marillyn Hewson ","And Peter, I will pick up on your question relative to impact of oil prices and what it might -- what we are seeing on our awards. We often talk about this because we are trying to watch. We are not seeing a pullback on essential national security assets and what these countries need. What we are seeing is that there is a couple of them that we are watching. And particularly one that\u2019s in our numbers and that we are watching very closely is the Qatar THAAD order because that\u2019s something that we are hoping to have in this year and it is in our plan -- it could potentially delay.","I think it\u2019s not an indication they are not going to buy it. To me it\u2019s just a matter of them balancing with pressure on their budgets with oil prices, balancing what they can buy. And I think we will see probably some of that, maybe it will impact some volumes or delays in some orders. But the bottom line is you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the US is not so prevalent there, they are having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand, it\u2019s just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That\u2019s not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day. I mean we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate anyway because as they are dealing with multiple procurements they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move on to the next. And so we have to wade through that process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein ","Can you talk a little bit about ULA? You had said you thought it would be flattish this year; it looks like it was down a little in the first quarter. And at least the press talked about a further headcount reduction this year and then again next year. So trying to just think about how severance would flow through. And then if I could follow up with a second one. Just in your proxy you removed the orders category from some of the incentive comp and just want to talk through why you would have made that change at this point?","Bruce Tanner ","Yes, Sam, I will take the ULA question. So ULA was down in the first quarter in terms of the equity earnings. It\u2019s purely timing, we actually expect ULA's earnings will be higher in 2016 than 2015. That\u2019s actually -- the primary reason behind the guidance increase in Space Systems is in fact because we do have a higher expectation of ULA. The severance charges that were taken on ULA, I don't think you will see much impact of that in the numbers and that\u2019s just a little bit of -- you have got the severance costs offset by the lower cost once the people are removed. And that will, I think at least in 2016, be somewhat neutral for the year. It\u2019s a little too early for me to call 2017, but that is the expectation for 2016.","Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well obviously -- but we actually had a lot of discussions with the Board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real-life conversations that we had. And we ultimately decided that sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards.","I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with the focus programs. And the thought was as long as we win the right programs, I mean whether or not -- I will make this up -- whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January is probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so, we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year.","Marillyn Hewson ","Let me just add to that. I think Bruce has covered it well, but just -- if you look at how we have outlined our incentive compensation, we have very clearly on the financials sales orders and cash -- I mean sales even cash as you see. And then where the orders come into play is in the strategic and operational area. And that is still an element of compensation. We look at it more in terms of focus programs, as Bruce said, or programs that we need to continue on contract growth with and keep sold and keep them forward. But as we flow down those metrics throughout the organization, the individuals in the organization are still going to be tracking their orders, they are still going to be driving to achieve levels of financial performance on the orders front. So, it\u2019s not something we have taken out, it\u2019s just that we have looked at it more realistically on how we -- what we should be compensating for in terms of incentive compensation. And it\u2019s still an element, it\u2019s just not outlined as a digital requirement.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro ","Bruce, I wanted to pursue on the F-35 margin, you said last year was 10% obviously including the one-time catch ups. Given that this year the profit was only up $30 million on $400 million sales increase, obviously that relates to having lower pickups. Could you tell us though what the F-35 margin actually was this year and maybe kind of what the run rate has been going at?","Bruce Tanner ","Yes. So, George, it\u2019s a little lower. I mean the reason I highlighted the first quarter of last year, that\u2019s probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that\u2019s to say that is what we expect eventually to become sort of standard practice is that will be a double-digit program going forward just as F-16s, F-22s, C-130s and you name the program are. First quarter of 2016 is a little less than 2015 but not much less. We still had good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step ups were lower, sort of the run rate of the program is higher. And therefore it\u2019s almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016. ","Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I have lost track now who asked it. But our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year in total is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression, not quite as high as the 100 basis points we talked last year but still progressing nicely and sort of in line with what I have said all along which is that double-digit by the time we get to full rate production.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman ","So on F-35, I think we all understand that there is a lot of good progress that has been made but that there is also still challenges ahead. So when you think about those challenges, which we read about fairly often, if the development portion of the program was to become extended, let's say, into 2018 in terms of financial implications, I am guessing they are fairly -- there is fairly little exposure to you. But are there concurrency implications to that? For example, if there are issues that delay the program further is the exposure for you sort of in going back into and making upgrades to aircraft? And could you talk about how much we should be concerned about that if at all?","Bruce Tanner ","Yes, let me take a shot, that\u2019s a really good question, Seth. And let me just give you hopefully a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we are progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I will say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what\u2019s going on with concurrency changes if in fact of the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in I will say large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all three variants.","We are -- I have lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all three variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability and we are in 150% of useful life and beyond I believe for where we are on the testing of that. So most of the structural items I would say, I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some relative to some software changes that come out of it relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We are still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We are making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. ","The Atlas program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that sort of is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we are doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of. But I think that\u2019s still going to support the IOC and whatever that's scheduled the fourth quarter or so of this year. I remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable. And I know your question was more on the concurrency. But we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and into early 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton ","Bruce and Marillyn, I think you talked about top-line organic growth targets of the company going forward in the 3% to 5% range with the outside contributor at Aeronautics. But that\u2019s also where you did the headcount reduction actions. So two kind of subpart questions. One, is that growth rate still the right growth rate to think about? And two, is this more of a reactionary headcount to some of the ongoing negotiations as it relates to F-35 and\/or other internal DOD competitive pressures?","Bruce Tanner ","Let me try that to begin with. I will let Marillyn chime in, Myles. But so I think I have said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think organically going forward you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven obviously by the F-35 program and Aeronautics in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas -- it may not be self evident because we've actually got some DOD contraction in some of the business areas there. But our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that\u2019s helping fuel that growth as well.","As far as the reductions, I would say that\u2019s not because of pressure that\u2019s being put on us from a DOD perspective. There is -- if you just think of sort of the lifecycle, it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there. The development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year over year. And so, the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing base workforce. And we are starting to see that transition occur. And that\u2019s what some of these reductions are for is simply the lower level of sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw in the development programs, if that makes sense.","Marillyn Hewson ","Yes, I would just -- I think you have got that right on the mark, Bruce. But to add to that, it\u2019s also changing the nature of the work that the indirect personnel support to that. And so you don't need the same number of people that are in certain roles as you move into the production phase and you ramp up that production.","Bruce Tanner ","It may not be perfectly evident, Myles, but recall we did -- we, Lockheed Martin, did -- were responsible for the large bulk of the development program there. Whereas the production program obviously is a lot more of the supply chain including two large partners there. So, they are doing pretty good chunks of the aircraft from a production perspective whereas we were doing I will say more of the development program as pure Lockheed Martin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Rubel ","Marillyn, there is -- not to kind of show off a little bit, but you didn't mention Pakistan and F-16s. And I suspect you probably have some other opportunities there. And then an addition to addressing that, would you also talk about a number of the items that are in the HASC mark that sure seem to play into your wheelhouse, whether it\u2019s the F-22 restart or some new air defense system opportunities?","Marillyn Hewson ","Thanks, Howard. Appreciate the question. And just from -- back to your question about F-16, I mean we continue to look for opportunities for F-16. Certainly Pakistan as it got through its congressional notification, we'll look forward to the opportunity on that. Bahrain, we hopefully ultimately at some point in the future will have an opportunity. In India we are continuing with our upgrades of the F-16, a lot of the modification work like in Taiwan, and so \u2013 ","Bruce Tanner ","And the potential line started in India.","Marillyn Hewson ","That\u2019s right. Yes, we talked about that India is looking at their tactical fighter competition and we are in there with an offer to move a production line to India.","In terms of the mark, the most recent mark that came out of the HASC for the defense bill, they have -- as you have seen, have added 11 aircraft for the F-35. And so we saw an increase last year in the FY16 Omnibus. And so, seeing that coming forward is important. There are also -- a lot of our programs are well supported just in the budget itself. And then with potential adds as they look at additional opportunities. ","On the F-22, I know there has been some discussion about a restart on the F-22 and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we are asked to provide. You are probably aware that the tooling [ph] does still exist, and so there will be -- as most programs, if you start one from a cold start I am sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start. But at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you will do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it and some of the design -- incorporate some of the things that we have learned through F-35 and other programs that you can incorporate into that. So we will stand ready to support that. ","But the bottom line is I think our programs are well supported in the President's budget submission. And then I think the market is going through -- would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there is a long way to go on the budget process; it\u2019s early days in getting through that. So we will remain hopeful that with our programs that are -- they really line up with the Department's strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Pete Skibitski ","Yes, thanks, nice quarter, guys. I appreciate the color on Sikorsky earlier. I was just wondering if you could go farther and update us on your expectations for -- your updated expectations for intangibles amortization this year and integration costs. And how fast or what magnitude you expect that to kind of drop off in \u201817 and \u201818?","Bruce Tanner ","Yes, thanks, Pete. I will take that on. So intangibles, we had said in the January call that those might move around. I think we have a year's time to sort of set the numbers there. I think we are real, real close. It\u2019s a slight improvement in the intangible amortization. When I say slight improvement, it's a little bit slower or smaller intangible amortization in 2016 than we had originally talked about, but not enough to get too excited about to be honest with you.","The integration cost, I still think that the bulk of that will be completed in 2017. And still some of that might carry over into 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 as we look forward there. I still think as we sit here today that we are tracking towards what we talked about when we did the acquisition, which was about $150 million or so per year of steady-state savings beginning in 2018. I still think that\u2019s a good possibility that that will be the number that we are seeing then. We have got a lot of work to do between now and then. And as I said earlier, I think we're actually tracking very nicely to what our expectations were on Sikorsky.","Jerry Kircher ","Abigail, this is Jerry. I think we will have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.","Cai von Rumohr ","So, if we can go back to the severance charge, Bruce, $99 million -- can you give us some color, how does that split between Aero and IS&G? What sort of folks did you lay off? Do you expect to recover all of it this year? And if so, how come the guide for Aero and IS&G didn't go up by more than $25 million each?","Bruce Tanner ","Yes so, I think the way you should think about the severance charge, Cai, is somewhere in the range of roughly three quarters is Aero, somewhere in the $70-ish million and the difference -- $70 million to $75 million maybe and the difference is in IS&GS. I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai, but somewhere in that range -- three quarters\/one quarter or so.","As I said earlier, and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reductions at Aeronautics. Most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required to \u2013 it\u2019s no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction. So we were pleased with that that people -- that it came with very few, I will say, involuntary reductions. So I think that\u2019s a good thing as well.","And then as far as the recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out, Cai. We are trying -- I mean I think in big picture terms you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry into 2017. We will watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next three quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016. But if -- and if there is we will surely tell you about it. And if it happens in 2017 we will try to give you insight into that quickly as well.","End of Q&A","Marillyn Hewson ","So let me conclude the call for today and I just want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed a very strong first quarter. Our robust backlog coupled with an increasing DOD budget has the Corporation positioned for top-line growth and increasing cash flows into the future. So, thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Abigail, that concludes the call today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",""],"13232":["Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 24, 2012  3:00 PM ET","Executives","Jerry F.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher","Thank you, Ally, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Jerry, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. We know most of you are having a really busy day, and we appreciate you being with us.","I want to begin with a brief summary of the third quarter, which I see as a continuation of the strong momentum and focus on execution we've been achieving throughout this year. In the third quarter, segment operating margin increased to 12.1%, a solid improvement over the prior year level of 11.2%. Cash generation was strong at $1.6 billion, and earnings per share from continuing operations expanded by 11%.","Our financial strength enabled a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.15 a share or $4.60 annually. This is the 10th consecutive year that we've raised the dividend by a double-digit percentage increase. We continue to implement our cash deployment strategy and returned over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases.","Strong year-to-date performance and execution also enabled us to increase our 2012 full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. These results reflect the strength of our corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to customers and shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their many contributions in driving these strong results.","Turning to the external environment and budget status. Congress passed the continuing resolution to fund government fiscal year 2013 activities for 6 months through March 27, 2013. Under this continuing resolution, our key programs continue to be supported and funded at levels consistent with prior fiscal year appropriations.","Beyond the continuing resolution that's in place, the possibility of sequestration continues to be of great concern to us. As currently written, this law that requires approximately $55 billion in reductions to defense accounts and a like amount to non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect on January 2. We have petitioned Congress and the administration to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive process, a position we continue to support.","In parallel, we've also been asking the government for additional planning information so we can responsibly and properly prepare to act. On September 28, the Department of Defense provided additional planning guidance, indicating that no contract actions associated with sequestration would occur on January 2, the date sequestration is to be effective, and that no contract action would likely occur for several months beyond January 2.","On that same day, the Office of Management and Budget assured that any of our employees who would potentially be affected by a reduction in force necessitated by sequestration would be eligible for full coverage under the provisions of the WARN Act and that our company would be able to recover associated costs. With this new information, we adjusted the timing of our actions as it would have been improper for us to issue WARN notices in October or November when the timing of any potential sequestration-related events would likely not occur for at least 6 months or more.","Some reporting about our decision to move the timing of the release of WARN notices has been inaccurate, concluding that we either no longer intend to issue WARN notices if a sequestration-driven reduction in force is necessary or that employees potentially affected by reduction in force would not have the full coverage of the WARN Act, or that our actions may have been taken to achieve some political objectives. These conclusions are not only inaccurate, they are absolutely wrong.","The additional planning guidance we received from the Department of Defense on September 28 moved the likely timing of sequestration-related actions by the government by about 3 months into 2013, and we adjusted our schedule accordingly. So let me be very clear. We will issue WARN notices at the appropriate time if sequestration actions meet the required conditions in full compliance with the law, as we always have. We will work to assure that our employees are treated fully and fairly under the law, receiving protection under the WARN Act which, for us, has been and remains a high and nonnegotiable priority. And our sole interest and motivation throughout all the discussions about sequestration has been to understand the complex issues arising from this unprecedented circumstance, to be fully compliant with law and regulation and to take actions in the best interest of our company and our employees. We have done so, and we will continue to work to stop sequestration.","So while I can't precisely forecast the impacts of sequestration or events that will unfold in a dynamic global security environment, there is one thing I know for certain. Every one of our 120,000 employees stands ready to take on whatever challenges will emerge. We worked hard over many years to build a culture based on ethics and integrity and high performance.","We have a strategy that is tuned to the complex global security environment we face. We have extraordinary talent and dedicated employees who have fashioned an all-weather portfolio of global solutions for global customers, and we continue on our drive to reduce costs and meet affordability goals.","We'll be happy to talk to you about these subjects and any other you may wish, but first, let's turn to Chris for an outline of our operational highlights. Chris?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Thanks, Bob. As you noted, from an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter and maintained our positive momentum in an uncertain and challenging environment. We also continue to implement strategic actions to increase our customer alignment and drive affordability throughout the enterprise.","We recently announced the de-layering and reorganization of our Electronic Systems business, resulting in 2 new business areas effective December 31. The businesses are Missiles and Fire Control, which focuses mainly on the mission of the Army and Special Operations Forces; and Mission Systems and Training, which supports the Navy and the Missile Defense Agency. This new structure will streamline management, reduce cost by $50 million a year and better position us to grow integrated services and support for our products.","I'm also proud of our continuous efforts to improve affordability, and I would like to highlight 3 areas: First, we're leveraging engineering processes in advanced technology; second, we've improved supply chain integration; and finally, we've reduced our overhead cost. One of the best opportunities to drive affordability is in the design and technology insertion phase, where we make decisions in concert with our customers about how mission success will be achieved.","We've developed Engineering for Affordability principles that center around rapid, transparent and collaborative decision-making to achieve mission success with the most affordable designs. Advanced technology is foundational to this approach. Application of advanced manufacturing processes and materials allows us to perform more rapid prototyping, reduce component costs, speed up the development process and shorten design cycles.","We are training our engineering work force to bring cost to the forefront in all of our development programs. The supply chain is another focus area. About 50% of our program content is provided by our suppliers and teammates. As systems become increasingly complex, tight integration of this network of companies is key to maintaining affordability.","To respond to this complexity, we have launched a focused effort to meet with our top suppliers and subcontractors to assure plans are in place to continuously improve their program execution, affordability and quality. We also have instituted corporate-wide agreements, which have generated more than $300 million in annual savings.","Reducing overhead cost is another element of our approach to affordability. Our significant successes in this area include reduction of $1.2 billion in annual cost over the past 2 years, while remaining on target for an additional $1.1 billion this year. We've reduced 1.5 million square feet of facilities over the past 2 years and have additional planned reductions of 2.9 million square feet for 2012 through 2014. With the future uncertain, we will continue with our initiatives, remain agile and take further actions should sequestration occur.","Turning to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continues to progress in development flight testing, solving technical challenges, increasing production deliveries and expanding international activities. Total flight test on the program have now been ahead of plan for the last 21 months.","Year-to-date through September, test flights are ahead of plan by 181 flights or 25%, and test points are also ahead of plan by over 1,100 points or 17%. We currently have 15 aircraft executing this plan. With our IAM partners back to work, production activities also continue to expand as we delivered 12 aircraft in the third quarter, up significantly from second quarter deliveries of 3 aircraft.","This brings year-to-date production deliveries to 17 aircraft, illustrating the program's maturity and progress. Internationally, the F-35 is maintaining strong partner support. This quarter, we delivered the first international aircraft to the United Kingdom with the acceptance of their initial STOVL aircraft. And Italy became the eighth international customer to formally fund procurement for aircraft.","We continue to receive significant interest and inquiries from other international countries as they evaluate the F-35 for their next-generation fighter requirements. We recognize that the key to the long-term success of the F-35 program is delivering fifth-generation capability while driving down the cost of the aircraft as quickly as possible, and it is happening.","Our later cost curve for assembling aircraft is improving faster than any previous fighter program dating back over 40 years. As volume increases, we believe this has us positioned to achieve the unit recurring flyaway cost objective of $67 million in FY '12 dollars by 2018. We are achieving these results by implementing various cost-cutting programs such as streamlining aircraft assembly, reducing time between building jets and improving material flow.","At Fort Worth earlier this week, I saw firsthand the improved aircraft processing flow and upgraded tooling that is helping to drive down the cost below the government's baseline estimates. In summary, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity, tempo and affordability, and the JSF team looks forward to providing this critical asset to our nation and our allies.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance.","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the third quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.9 billion, similar to what we generated in the second quarter this year. Our segment operating profit margin was strong at 12.1%, and I'll discuss that in more detail in a couple of charts.","Earnings per share grew 11% to $2.21. Our cash from operations was a robust $1.6 billion, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share while also increasing our outlook for sales, earnings, EPS and operating cash for the full year. Lastly, in our release today, we provided preliminary 2013 financial trends and pension information, and I'll discuss those in a little more detail in later charts as well.","On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. Aeronautic sales were 7% lower than in the third quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower C-130 deliveries and F-22 production volume. Electronic Systems sales grew 4% in the quarter as all 3 lines of business had growth over the same period last year. As expected, IS&GS had lower sales than last year, but the decline was only 1% as we experienced continued growth in our Intelligence line of business, driven by federal cyber activities. Space Systems sales were 5% lower than the same period last year as we had one commercial satellite delivery last year and none this quarter. So overall, a 2% decline in sales driven by lower aircraft quantities in the quarter and the timing of satellite deliveries.","On a year-to-date basis, on Chart 5, you can see that 3 of the 4 business areas have experienced growth over the 2011 period with total sales up 2%. This strong performance led to the increase in our full year sales outlook.","On Chart 6, we'll discuss our segment operating profit margins for the quarter. The primary reason for the 90 basis point margin increase to 12.1% was due to improvements in Electronic Systems and Space Systems. In Electronic Systems, the margin improved by 110 basis points to 13.3%. The improvement came from Missiles and Fire Control, primarily in air and missile defense programs and MS2 from our ship and aviation systems programs.","The increased margin for Space Systems was primarily due to higher equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance and wind down activities associated with the United Space Alliance. The margins for Aeronautics and IS&GS were relatively comparable to last year.","Turning to Chart 7 and our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations grew 11% over the amount reported last year, driven mostly by the higher margins in the quarter. And adjusting our reported EPS for the effects of the FAS\/CAS adjustment, increases our EPS to $2.60 per share.","If you'll turn to Chart 8, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year. Operating cash was just under $1.6 billion this quarter compared to $551 million last year. But last year included nearly $1 billion in pension contributions. And considering the strong performance so far this year, we again increased our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than, or equal to, $4 billion for the year.","On Chart 9, we'll discuss the dividend increase in the quarter, our 10th consecutive year of double-digit increases. You can see the dramatic increase in dividend levels and yield over the past 5 years with the current yield in 2012 more than twice what it was in 2008. And the increase brings our annualized dividend yield to just about 5% based on recent prices.","On Chart 10, we'll discuss our updated guidance. Due to the year-to-date sales performance, we increased our sales outlook by $500 million. We increased segment operating profit by $175 million. We also increased earnings per share by $0.30, as I'll detail on the next chart. And again, we increased our cash from operations by $100 million.","Chart 11 shows our earnings per share outlook reconciliation. You can see that the segment margin -- segment operating profit increase was the primary reason for adding $0.30 to our guidance, reflecting the increased earnings outlook by each of the 4 business areas.","Chart 12 shows our increased sales guidance, with all 4 business areas increasing guidance for the year, resulting in the $500 million increase in total. Space Systems has the largest increase, $250 million, reflecting strong government satellite activity. And Electronic Systems increased by $150 million with growth coming from both MS2 and Missiles and Fire Control.","Chart 13 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Here again, all 4 business areas are increasing their outlook for the year with the largest increases also coming from Electronic Systems and Space Systems, and the total increase for the year equaling $175 million.","On Chart 14, we'll discuss the preliminary trends we see for 2013. First, our trend data does not assume the impacts of sequestration as there are still many unknowns remaining as to how sequestration would be implemented if enacted. With that caveat, we expect a low single-digit decline in our total sales volume. Aeronautics and Electronic Systems are expected to be roughly comparable with 2012 levels. Space is expected to be down slightly due to the absence of any commercial satellite deliveries in 2013. And for IS&GS, we are expecting to decline in the mid single-digit range resulting primarily from the continued downturn in federal IT budgets. IS&GS also is expected to have the greatest impact from the continuing resolution due to the short-cycle nature of the business. We expect our segment operating margin will remain above 11% next year, the seventh consecutive year that our margin will exceed 11%.","And with an assumed 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate at year end down to 4% and an 8% return on assets this year, our FAS\/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be $700 million, about $135 million lower than the 2012 level. Finally, we expect the level of pension contributions next year to be comparable to this year's level, although I'll remind you that we'll be considering potential discretionary contributions between now and year end, consistent with our historical practice.","And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 15. The third quarter built upon the strong performance we've demonstrated this year, and our increased outlook reflects our expectation that 2012 will be a very solid year. We continue to return value to shareholders with our industry-leading dividend yield, and we'll be providing detailed guidance on the January call reflecting our new business area alignments.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris for final thoughts before we open up for questions. Chris?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Well, thanks, Bruce. I just wanted to take a quick minute and remind everyone that this is Bob's last earning call as he steps down as CEO later this year and, therefore, he won't be joining us on future calls.","Despite knowing his aversion to personal praise and accolades, I want to thank him for his service and stewardship of our corporation. Bob's leadership and passion have been embedded in the DNA of our corporation. His focus on mentoring and training the next-generation leaders has created the deepest bench strength in the industry and will serve the corporation for decades to come.","On a personal note, I've had the privilege of working with Bob for over a decade in my various roles, and I've seen his passion for the mission and his drive for excellence demonstrated on a daily basis. I know many of you on the call have also had the pleasure and opportunity to interact with Bob over the years. So Bob, I'd like to speak for all of us, and thank you for your contributions, and wish you the best.","With that, I'll open up the lines for questions, Ally, and we stand by to answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, Bob, it's hard to believe it's your last earnings call, and just wanted to say it's been great working with you over the years. I mean, you've always provided some great insights regarding both the company and the industry, and so I wish you all the best going forward. But I'd like to get one more insight from you on a favorite topic here, which is the F-35. If you look back over your last several years, could you describe how the F-35 program has changed in 2 ways? First, how has Lockheed Martin's relationship with the customer evolved since negotiations always appear to be pretty tense and neither of you has much of an alternative to the other? And then second, how has Lockheed Martin's approach to performance change along with that of the program office so you can avoid some of the pitfalls that we saw farther back in the past related to cost and quality and schedule? So perhaps you could give us a sense of those 2 things.","Robert J. Stevens","Sure, I'll do my best, Doug. Thanks for the kind comments. Let me start with the evolution of the program and customer relations. I actually think that with respect to expectations, we've been very, very close with all our customers, and I would extend that to members of the Congress. I think everybody understands that we have an aging tactical fighter fleet, that we need to recapitalize that fleet, that we need fifth-generation capabilities. And in the most ideal circumstance, we would not do this alone, but we would do this with friends and allies so that we would have both burden sharing on the cost and flexibility and interoperability on the mission capability side of that platform, and the F-35 does all those things. Since I was here at the beginning or the inception of the F-35 program, I know full well that no one really underestimated the challenge or the complexity of bringing online a fifth-generation airplane with 3 variants that would have the performance characteristics that are embedded in the F-35. And I would tell you in my best professional judgment having done this for a long time, while there are areas of challenges that we continue to work on, there are other areas where we've done very well. And I think if you scale the size of this program, recall that many people talk about it being the biggest program or the most expensive program, but it is designed to replace more than 10 other kinds of airplanes. So that if you have an overrun of a percentage, it's a big overrun because it's a big complex program. Anytime we don't meet a performance commitment, we feel there's been a shortfall on our part, and we redouble our efforts to accomplish those goals. But I think the program has had the highest level of visibility, the most number of detailed reviews and absolutely the greatest level of transparency where you all on the call know the technical details of this program as it's unfolding almost at the same time the engineers responsible for the performance of the system know it. And I think there's some very good features of that, and I think there's some really lousy features of that because people come to the wrong conclusion because they haven't done this before as to what is a likely outcome about resolving a technical issue. So we know that it's not easy, but this program is succeeding. And I'll ask Chris to comment in a moment because it's worth the time to comment. He spent time in Fort Worth with the new Chief of Staff of the Air Force, who's deeply involved in this program. Chris will give you his own assessment. You mentioned customer relations. It's a challenging program, but I personally believe the customer wants what we want, and we will do everything that we must do to have very high quality relations and get everything about this program right because the stakes for the country and for our friends and allies are just too damn high to set the bar anywhere else. With regard to our performance, we've always been realistic. We have superb subject matter expertise here. I would put our high-speed combat tactical fighter airplane program credentials against any other company on this planet, and I believe there are those who would kill to have the capabilities we have in not only our company, but remember, the extensive supply chain that we built for the F-35 around the world. So it's a complicated program, but it is improving in its dimensions. We're happy to pick ourselves up and move ourselves forward. When we're doing well, we'll tell you. When we're not doing well, we'll redouble our efforts to get this right. Chris, you have some insight. You've been in Fort Worth just this week.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, thanks, Bob. Doug, a couple things I may want to point out is, we actually have 94 aircraft in production flow between Fort Worth, Marietta and the Italian facility. So we have LRIP 3 aircraft all the way up through and including our first LRIP 7 airplane. So I'm not sure everyone appreciates the quantity and the speed at which these aircraft are, in fact, being produced. And as I look ahead to next year, we will actually deliver more F-35s in 2013 than the F-16 and the C-130J combined. So the volume is picking up. The production is going well, and the customer has been very satisfied in the deliveries that we've made. And as many of you may know, even later this year, the Marine Corps is preparing for its first operational base for the F-35 at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma. So there's some outside perspective to give you the volume and the progress that we're making. I guess specifically you asked about the relationship and General Bogdan was in Fort Worth recently, last week, if I recall, had very productive meetings with the team. We're very excited about him taking over, and we're looking forward to working with him. And we're both committed to 100% strong -- 100% commitment to a strong and collaborative relationship. As Bob said, I was recently, this week, down with General Welsh. He's very engaged. He was checking on the status of his aircraft, and both these gentlemen are very demanding. They hold us to the highest standards possible, and we actually prefer that. So we're looking forward to a great 2013 on F-35 and much more after that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, Bob, a couple of years ago, you laid out a vision for making Lockheed a global security company. And, in a way, one can see the proposed move with EADS and BAE as some attempts to -- for others to catch up on that. Can you expand a little bit on what you see going forward in terms of pressing on, on that vision? Do you think that you would be looking -- that the company would be looking for international acquisitions or pieces of that to sort of build more of a global perspective?","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, thanks for the question, Heidi. When we talked years ago about a global security company, we were not necessarily focusing on international acquisitions as much as expanding international opportunities by building the core portfolio of the business that would address the emerging or evolving needs. Of course, at the time, we were talking about cyber security. When I think others weren't talking about cyber security, we were talking about moving more into services business and support and logistics for the core that we have. I will tell you, I'm really quite pleased with the portfolio that we have and how well that portfolio is maturing. Now I will certainly say in the same breath that which was embedded in Doug's question, we want to do a better job on the F-35. We know there are areas where we need to improve, and I think we're a company that realistically looks at that. But I'm very pleased with the portfolio. So as we look at the evolution of global security now, we take into account the evolution of world economic conditions that I think, generally, we would describe as showing signs of stress, and the stress may be different depending upon what region of the world we look at. But generally, we've concluded there'll be fewer resources available to our customers, wherever those customers may be, relative to meeting what is essentially a growing set of demands in the global security environment, which tells us, as we evolve this portfolio into international opportunities, we must continue to drive on affordability and cost reduction. And I think we're doing that effectively, and we have not stopped the continuous pursuit of refining that model. I think we've done a very good job of exploiting partnerships internationally, rather than making the international acquisitions as the only avenue to extend the range of our company, we've sought out very high-quality partners who bring immediate value-added credentials to enhance our offerings. And I think you should look for more of that from us. But you should also think of us relative to acquisitions in terms of extending the string-of-pearls approach of very selective, very high-quality, very easy to integrate, very specific and purposeful additions to the business. So I do expect more from Chris and the leadership team on extending the global security reach of the company.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Heidi. I'll just -- it's Chris. I'll give you a little more insight. Here in the third quarter, 25% of our orders were actually from international customers. And as you know we're -- currently about 17% of our revenue is derived from foreign military sales and direct commercial sales. I see it halfway to about 20%, and I think that's based on the strength of the portfolio, as Bob said. And when you look at Missile Defense with PAC-3 and THAAD, the precision-guided weapons and of course, the aircraft, I'd be disappointed if we're not at that 20% goal in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Loomis at Stifel, Nicolaus.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a question on IS&G [ph] on the outlook. You talked about a lower, mid single-digit decline next year, yet you've won some pretty substantial contracts, the DISA\/GSM-O and DoD\/DC3 are just 2 of them. What's going away as some of these bigger wins you've had are ramping up over the next year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Bill, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. I think -- when I think about IS&GS going to next year, there's really sort of 2 pressures that we see occurring kind of simultaneously. One is, as you're well aware of, there is a 6-month continuing resolution at least for the first 6 months of the fiscal year. I'll remind you that IS&GS is the shorter cycle business of our -- of all of our business areas, and therefore, it converts the most sales from the current fiscal year of any of our business areas. So that continuing resolution period caused us to have some pause from some increases that might otherwise have happened had that not been in place. And the second element that's causing some pressure in '13 is simply the overall federal IT budget. And if you take a look at where the federal IT budget is planned for 2013 and beyond, it has some significant reductions from the previous year's level, and being that we're the largest provider of IT services for 18 straight years, it's hard to overcome that sort of budget reduction when you're as big a player in that marketplace as we are. So those are really the 2 biggest drivers going into next year. And I wouldn't want to split it up and say, which one's the bigger contributor. But I'd say that probably, if I was, it would be the overall IT budget reductions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First off, Bob, great working with you over a very long period of time, and best wishes to you. I have a more mundane question, just on the change in Electronic Systems and the restructuring there or the realignment there. Just on the surface, it doesn't seem like breaking one segment into 2 would save money. And, obviously, that's what you guys are in the business are doing these days. So maybe if you could help elaborate on why that saves money. And if it's just a matter of taking a layer out, why wasn't it done previously? Just finally, on the same point, does this -- can we read anything into this in terms of potential portfolio moves next year?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Joe, this is Chris. I'll take an attempt at that. The way we eliminate cost in this is that we've eliminated a layer between the businesses, and then ultimately, the executive office. If you go back in history, maybe a decade ago or so, we had probably 12 individual entities, maybe all in the $0.5 billion to $1 billion range in the Electronic Systems business area oversaw and managed that broad portfolio. Over time, we've consolidated and combined each of those entities, most recently with the Owego being combined into our MS2 business. Prior to that, I think the Eagan facility as well. So when we looked at the current alignment, we had about 4 businesses reporting in, and we thought they'd gotten to the scale and the size that we could consolidate them. Each of these will themselves eliminate some cost, and we're looking at probably close to 200 of our employees will be laid off as part of this process here in the coming months. And I think it was the right thing to do, and it was the right time to do it.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of portfolio moves, anything we can read into it, Chris?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","No, no. It was just too -- like I said, to eliminate the cost, get closer to the customer and better align our training and services business with the underlying core product. So that's all there was to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Lazard Capital Markets.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","My question is how do you see the book to bill ending out Q4? And I think the more important question is, have you noted any momentum from the POs on getting awards out the door quicker following the year end and now moving into the next fiscal year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, Michael, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Book to bill wise, let me just -- maybe just address it with sort of a backlog perspective. I think we're at $75.6 billion or something like that through the end of the third quarter. That's basically tracking where we thought we'd be at this time. We're actually probably a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be otherwise. I've said on previous calls, and I'll say on this one, I still think we will end the year fairly close to where we began the year at close to $80 billion of backlog. And the orders that need to happen in the fourth quarter, there's very few of them that are, I'll say, competitive orders. Most of them are sort of just fiscal year orders that happen every year. And they're not the sort of orders that are subject to the sequestration limits because they're not necessarily large orders that are increasing over the prior fiscal year's last year same time frame. The one big item that we're watching is in order to get to that level that I talked about again close to where we started the year and from a backlog perspective, we need to close on the F-35 LRIP 5 contract and get the additional fundings from an undefinitized [ph] contractual action for Lot 6 on that. We stand here today thinking that can be done in the fourth quarter, and that's the basis of the planning that we have for the end of the year for that backlog number. As far as your second question, some acceleration, I think we saw some of that throughout the year. That's again one of the reasons are why I think we were ahead of where we thought we might otherwise be at the end of the third quarter. And I think people that -- I can't remember, Chris or whoever said it earlier but some comments about unfunded obligations and trying to get funds put on contract as we head into a sequestration environment. I think we saw some customer actions doing that. It's hard to put a figure on that, if you will, but I think we did see some or experience some that earlier this year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bob, best of luck with the next chapter. A quick question just as a bit of a follow on kind of taking the last questioner's topic one step further and talk about '13 as it relates to the opportunity set. Assuming that sequester, there's some sort of resolution there, what are the things that are going to drive backlog and book to bill next year? And given the pipeline and the visibility that you have, is it possible for us to continue to maintain a book to bill around 1?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","So Jason, this is Chris. Let me give you a couple of the larger opportunities and orders that we're looking at. We have F-16 in Iraq. We have a multiyear potential for the C-130J with the U.S. government. We have the next tranche of C-5 aircraft. And while it probably wouldn't be an order, but there is a decision for the F-35 in South Korea. I think that might actually hit the books when we're successful in 2014, but the decision should be announced later this year in 2013. So we see those opportunities in Aeronautics, in the Space business. Of course, Orion, we're looking at 2 more Cerberus satellites, and there's actually a couple commercial satellites internationally that we're in current discussions with. So I see opportunities there as well. The former Electronic Systems, a couple more Littoral Combat Ships, as I mentioned in my upfront comments, missile defense between Egypt and PAC-3 and THAAD we see lots of opportunities, not only here but around the globe. And then within IS&GS, there's several opportunities including a couple international, specifically in Australia and working with the Missile Defense Agency here. So it's a pretty broad portfolio. Some of these are competitive. Some are follow-on, but we're pretty optimistic about the 2013 opportunities to grow this enterprise.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, and Jason you asked the question could we kind of hold -- I think if I understood your question right, could we kind of hold to the level of backlog that we end this year. Now we still think we'll end the year 2013 assuming the orders that Chris just described come through at about, again, for another year have about the $80 billion level as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First of all, best of luck for the future, Bob. It's been quite a ride.","Robert J. Stevens","Thank you.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I have is regarding the dividend. You highlighted that you've raised dividend again quite recently, another double-digit increase. You're now paying it over 50% of earnings, over 50% of free cash flow. How much longer can these double-digit increases continue until they start to get a little bit unsustainable?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Rob. I'll take that one on. We -- I think we've been very pleased with the dividend increases and what we think this brought in terms of, I'll say, at least from my perspective, a little bit of price stability, and I think a little bit of price floor to the stock price since we've increased the dividend here recently to the levels that we have now. Several years back under Bob and Chris' leadership, we committed to providing 50% or more of free cash flow in the form of either dividends or share repurchases. I'm pleased to say with the increases we've given in dividends, we now do that strictly by the dividends that we do provide. If we just stop there with dividends, you're already at the 50% of free cash flow. As I look this year and next year, I mean, the first thing that I tend to do when I look at the dividend and payouts and the like is I do adjust for the FAS\/CAS. So if I was to do that this year, for instance, I think we'd add back $1.60 or so for the FAS\/CAS impact to our numbers and therefore, the earnings per share gets close to a $10 per share number. So when you kind of get on the cash-on-cash basis, the dividends are less than 50% as I would view it today. And I think going forward, the question is how much cash do we need to invest in the company to support the growth rate of the company. We're generating far more cash today than we need to support the growth rate, particularly when that growth rate starts to slow going forward. And so going forward, I still believe we will be generating more cash than we need to support the growth of the company, and we will have the opportunity when CAS Harmonization kicks in, in particular the next 2 years to recover a lot of the discretionary, and not just discretionary but that's a big piece of it, pension payments that we've paid in the last few years. And that will have the effect of increasing cash over what you might ordinarily think as sort of an average run rate. I'll remind you that we have some $4 billion of advanced funding in our pension plan that is yet to be recovered under our government contracts. So as CAS Harmonization plays out over the next few years, that will be added to sort of this the average run rate, if you will, of cash generation. And I think that's where the opportunity to continue with dividends and other cash deployment actions, not just dividends, will come from.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, and Bob, let me join the other folks in congratulating you on a job extraordinarily well done.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Cai.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So pension, $700 million, walk us through some of the assumptions, I guess, you talked a little bit about the discount rate that's like where is your return, what are you assuming for return on assets and where are you year-to-date? What should we look for CAS to do next year? What should we look for your contributions to be next year?","Bruce L. Tanner","Cai, I'll take that one also. So pensions were -- we changed our long-term rate, I'd say the start of this year, I guess, end of last year to 8% per year. We're tracking very nicely to that as we sit here today. I think the overall global markets are above that, and we're tracking, I'll say, nicely with what a little less than 2 months to go on the year, but I feel good about what our returns are for this year. Next year's numbers were also premised -- well, I'll back up. Next year's numbers were premised on us achieving 8% this year. So that's the starting point. And as far as the CAS cost next year by itself, I'm trying to recall that, but I think the CAS cost itself goes up to like 1 point -- think of it $1.4-ish billion or so. Think of a FAS number, if we stop today somewhere around $2.1 billion, and that's how you get to the $700 million FAS\/CAS adjustment. And the contributions that we're expecting to make next year are essentially the same as this year, you should think as $1.1-ish billion range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Chris, I wanted to go back to something you had said earlier in the call. You talked about $1.2 billion of overhead reduction in the last few years and on the docket for another $1.1 billion this year. I guess I'm trying to just understand, how much does it cost for you to actually accomplish that? What kind of returns do you get, and then how much of that do you actually get to keep as opposed to it ultimately going back to the customer?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Sam. That's a great question. It varies by business area. This is pretty much the overhead reduction. A lot of this ties to some of the facility. I gave you some numbers on the facility square footage that were taken out. We do a business case and a payback for all these affordability projects that we have. And generally, they pay back within the 12- to 18-month cycle. So when we do something like facility consolidation, we'll be moving the cost of moving the cost of consolidating as it relates to that. Right now, we're about 50% cost plus 50% fixed price. So half goes in back to the government, if you will. The other half generally is built into our forward pricing to some degree. It really depends on the backlog mix. But the investment to get these overhead savings are not that significant and generally results in both people and capital assets as the main driver. Of course, we're focused on processes and new systems and such, but it's a pretty quick payback.","Robert J. Stevens","And Sam, I'll -- let me add to that. The conversation that we have internally here has placed a greater emphasis on this general subject of affordability and cost reduction because with or without sequestration, we know that we're facing a long cycle where the demands of our security customers are going to go up relative to their missions, and they're not going to have the economic resources available to meet those growing demands. And we've got to get out in front of this. So we're pushing ourselves, and Chris is absolutely right, and embedded in your question is the notion. You certainly want to pick the highest payoff opportunities and do them the soonest, and we are. But I'm not and we've not been reluctant to look at all sorts of cost-reduction opportunities even if they have a longer payback, as long as they payback because it's going to be a longer cycle process that we're involved with where it's going to take continuous refinement, continuous refocusing. And one of the benefits that we think we achieved from some of these reorganizations is not necessarily measured in the economic return but in our ability to have greater levels of agility and more refined resource allocation. So we can move with the increasing rate of the volatility in our markets. One of the characteristics we've seen out on the marketing horizon is this shorter cycle, much more highly volatile environment where change is occurring more quickly, and you have to be able to respond to that change. And so there's sort of this proportionality between the size and structure of the organization and the ability to move quick at the edge. And we're getting better at moving quick to the edge, and with that, we can take cost out of the business.","Bruce L. Tanner","Sam, you might get a triple out of this one because I'll speak to this one also, and I think I'm going to go back to something Chris said in his opening remarks. I think we're all good -- we've all demonstrated, we've all done this throughout our careers of taking the kind of actions to reduce facilities' headcount when it's required. And I don't think that's necessarily all that newsworthy or all that new and innovative. What Chris mentioned in his opening remarks that I'm talking about taking into account affordability into the design of products and sort of getting that upfront view of affordability, that's something I'm actually very excited about. And I think we've really just sort of scratched the surface on that. And as we see the chance to bid and win new products with that concept in mind, I think you will see some really interesting characteristics coming out of that because we are changing the nature of maybe how we've done that in years past in a manner and in a process that I think is going to pay off significantly to both ourselves and our customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bob, let me join everyone in congratulating you on all your successes. I think, Chris, he's left you with a pretty high bar for stock price performance, and I think as a shareholder, he'll hold you to it. So best of luck on that.","Robert J. Stevens","Thank you. He's up to it, Carter. He's up to it.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to expand on the last question, if you will. Obviously, your peers are sort of chasing down the cost curve as well to remain competitive, and I wondered if you might tell us how it is that you benchmark yourself against the peer group to see how well of a job you're actually doing and getting cost out. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of overhead that's going to need to come out of the industrial base, given the budget forecast that we're looking at even out without sequestration. And so I wondered if you might share with us how it is that you benchmark yourself, and then give us kind of an assessment of where you are relative to your peers and your efforts so far.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, I'll be very blunt about this. We started to take cost out before our peers, and we had no reservation about being the first mover here as there are an extraordinary number of metrics that we can benchmark ourselves to. We think one of the most meaningful ones is examining our win rate when we get our feedback from our customer. How many competitions are we losing because we were not cost competitive because that brings at home more clearly than anything else. I think what will give us the competitive advantage as we move forward with a competitive group that is also attempting to remove cost is we've made significant new investments in new products, where others have older product lines that will require new investments. For example, we have the Littoral Combat Ship. We have the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter which is a fifth-generation capability. We've refreshed Aegis to an open architecture. We evolved PAC-3, and we're evolving the THAAD missile system. These are all new and fresh technologies. We have a similar portfolio in Space Systems. The vitality and the vibrancy and the recent investment in these new next-generation systems I think has a lot more legs in a competitive climate, particularly in a climate where we'll be taking cost out. So our goal here is to focus on the benchmarks in the industry. We're entirely comfortable of front running the industry when we have confidence in knowing what we have to do and how we have to do it, and we have that confidence. We think we have a relevant portfolio that's proven. And as we drive higher levels of affordability, we think we'll pass that metric of cost competitiveness in competitive awards as we look forward.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Carter, and I'm glad you asked the follow-up question because we do spend a lot of time talking about affordability. And the point I was trying to get across is it's more than the cost cutting. We talked about the supply chain, and Bruce reemphasized the importance of the engineering and design. We can go on all day, but another very, very important element is the volume. And the executive leadership team spends a fair amount of their time traveling the globe, building relationships, meeting with customers because we all know whatever product it is, if we can get some of our allies and friends around the globe to also purchase airplanes or missiles, not only does the U.S. government benefit but they benefit as well just from a financial perspective. There's obviously a strategic, operational and other benefits of a coalition warfare. But that's another leg of the affordability, and we spend a lot of time trying to grow this business. And that's one of the benefits that all of our customers realize.","Jerry F. Kircher","Ally, this is Jerry. Just to be sure, I've got a note here that there's 7 people in the queue. We have some ability to go longer today, so we'd like to catch the people that are still in the queue. So we're going to extend the call, if that's all right. So let's do the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Bob, once again, best wishes. I wanted to just ask about, if I might, about build rates at Aeronautics, C-130J, C-5 and F-16. I think you're delivering 34 C-130Js this year, 37 F-16s if I got my numbers right. Just wanted to know if you could comment if you're anticipating similar run rates next year, or could this moderate some? Also, I know you're tracking a bunch of new orders and I just wanted to know if any of them you think might impact '13 deliveries.","Bruce L. Tanner","Rich, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Chris made an interesting observation relative to our expectations next year with the F-35 deliveries surpassing both C-130 line and the F-16 line. I think that's kind of the new era that we're facing in the corporation, an era where obviously the F-35 is going to become the dominant production line in the corporation. And it started this quarter, the third quarter with more deliveries for the F-35 in this quarter than any of the other 2 aircraft as well. As we look into 2013, and I look at Aeronautics in general, there's a lot of mix that's going on within Aeronautics. In my prepared remarks, I said that Aeronautics is going to be relatively comparable next year from a revenue perspective to where they are this year, but there's a lot of moving pieces in that number. So you're spot on with the aircraft quantities that you gave for 2012. You should expect somewhere on the order of 20 to 25 fewer F16s next year than this year, and that's predominantly because we're building in 2012 some 24 aircraft for the government of Turkey, and they're actually being built off the Turkish line. So while we hate to lose the aircraft, I guess the good news of that discussion is that, really, the aircraft build rate at Fort Worth won't change from 2012 and 2013. So there's an element of stability there that might not be apparent, given the quantity changes. We're also looking to lower the C-130 build rate. You're right, the numbers, we should do 33, 34 this year or so. We're going to ramp back down to about a 24 per month -- or I wish it's a month, 24 aircraft per year build rate on the C-130 beginning next year, and we think that, that level allows us to have again sort of a stable build line for a number of years going into the future. And then offsetting those 2 reductions, which may not be all that apparent, I don't think you mentioned C-5 but we're going to deliver 3 or 4 of the C-5 in the RERP aircraft or Re-engining and Reliability Improvement Program for C-5s. And those 3 or 4 will grow to probably close to 10 or so next year. We're getting very close to the sort of the maximum rate on the C-5 program, which I think it's about 11 aircraft per year to modify those 49 C-5 into the RERP configuration. So between the lower F-16s, the fewer C-130s, higher C-5 and then the missing piece is higher F-35 volume next year, Aeronautics is going to stay relatively comparable. But again, as I just indicated, a lot of moving pieces in that discussion.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","And Rich, you asked us, while we'll be working hard to get new orders over the next several months, none of those would impact 2013 deliveries, it would be beyond the calendar year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think this one's probably for Bruce. In terms of your guidance for 2013, not exactly sure what above 11% means, but in terms of the margins, but if you could help us a little bit with the big pieces that would impact margin next year, obviously a little bit lower volume. I think USA is going away, level of cume adjustments and whatever else you want to throw in there.","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to get at this point, David, any more specific than what we provided in the press release relative to the margins that we did say. I do think we're going to be above 11%. I think as I said in my remarks seventh consecutive year where we have been above 11%. As we look at 2013, maybe what I ought to do is just kind of go around by the business areas and talk a little bit of that. I spent a lot of time just talking to Aeronautics, I think Aeronautics revenue I should say. If I think of the earnings around the margin of Aeronautics, because of all the mix changes that I just described, I think we'll have slightly lower margins at Aeronautics primarily because of the mix changes that I just described. We're losing some F-16s and losing some C-130s at higher margins and replacing that with C-5 and F-35 at lower margins. I still think we'll be in the 11-ish percent range for Aeronautics. So not a huge drop-off but probably not as high as this year. If I go over to Electronic Systems, I think Electronic Systems is probably the one business area I can look at and say even with the numbers I'm seeing now, I'm hopeful at least that there will be some potential for some modest growth there above even what I'm thinking of for 2013. And relative to the margins, I think the margins will stay at the 13-plus percent range. I'll qualify that though by saying that we're going to give you in January a new configuration with 2 new business areas. So I'll say I'll hold that thought till January, but I'll give you the data in the current configuration. And I would say we're going to stay fairly close to where we are today from a margin perspective in all of Electronic Systems. Space Systems is likely going to be down slightly, primarily because we will have slightly lower equity earnings because of the USA closure. For all intents and purpose that, that joint venture is coming to a close this year. Despite that, I think with some of the production satellite programs that are now going through the production phase and are well out of the developmental phase, we're seeing some higher margins on those contracts, and I think that we'll probably see margins a little bit lower. But I would guess in the mid-11 for Space Systems going next year, they've had a benefit this year from a couple of the closeouts that we talked about the wind down of the USA that won't replicate next year. And then I guess the last, IS&GS, I would think it will follow very closely to where we are now, somewhere in the 9-ish percent margin range. I think I covered all 4 of them, David, probably more detail than you care to hear, but I think that covers it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bob, again, congratulations, and best wishes.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two -- I'll try to make them quick. One for Chris, one for Bruce. Bruce, I'll just start with you. On your color on '13, are you assuming full obligation of CR funds to spending authority limits, or do you embed some kind of cushion for this half-paralyzed environment we've seen at times this year because unless we assume full resolution of sequester by early '13, I would think -- and formal adoption of the fiscal '13 president's request, might we think of this as a best case scenario at least for revenues?","Bruce L. Tanner","Rob, I thought about that quite a bit, and I don't think so. I don't think it's the best case scenario. I mean, obviously the worst case would be a sequester, but is this a best case? I'm not sure of that. We have very...","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Negotiated outcome would be something between what I think your assumptions are and full sequester.","Robert J. Stevens","Rob, let me -- so when we paid this, they're -- now we're talking about some combinatorial -- some possibilities here. But it is possible we'll have a CR through March 27, and it's possible that a CR will be extended. There are also appropriation bills that have been marked, and a fair amount of effort has been gone into, let me say, preparing those bills to move. So it is possible the bill could move even without a resolution to sequester because part of these interesting combinations that make any detailed planning on our part impossible as to what the outcomes could be would be a movement of the appropriation bills and some deferral sequestration while a more thoughtful process to achieve what's called the larger or the big transaction, the full scope resolution that includes tax policy, entitlement reform and defense and nondefense discretionary spending. That could occur too. Thereby, lifting the opportunity in 2013 with regard to appropriated levels of funding rather than CR levels of funding. So there are interesting combinations here that could either put a little pressure on '13 or actually relieve some pressure on '13. Sorry to interrupt you, Bruce.","Bruce L. Tanner","No, I was -- Bob is talking in much more detail and thorough answer probably than I was going to do. Rob, the other thing I was going to say is I'll just remind you of our portfolio as you go around the 4 business areas, really Aeronautics and Space Systems for a large intent and purposes don't have much impact to the CR because most of their sales are coming from fiscal year '13 budgets. So very -- I'm not sure I used the word insulated but very little impact from there. IS&GS, as I've said many times, short-cycle business would be the most subject to CR. But frankly, we weren't expecting a whole lot of growth year-over-year, fiscal year over fiscal year in that business to begin with. And then Electronic Systems is somewhere in between. I think you had a question for Chris that you didn't get to ask, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Best wishes, Bob. A couple of follow-ups and clarifications. You didn't mention when you're talking about bookings the larger Space contract that I think was a 2012 opportunity, and I don't think you mentioned it within the realm of the '13 opportunities either. Is that still on the table? And I guess, Bruce, it's not implied to get to $80 billion, you need this to happen.","Bruce L. Tanner","Rob, I'll just say our government satellite -- or I'm sorry, Myles. That's 2 calls in a row. I called you the wrong name, Myles. I'll just leave it and say that our government satellite business is very healthy, strong and well supported. The $80 billion achievement if we're able to get that this year, I didn't mention that re-alliance [ph] on government satellites because I'm not concerned about that relative to our ability to achieve that number.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to clarify. So you don't need it to achieve the number?","Bruce L. Tanner","We do not.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question was really more around the F-35 and the overall life cycle opportunity, which has always been a key part of that program. It sounds like the customer wants to, not surprisingly, insert some competition to maintain pricing discipline. Has your view changed on Lockheed Martin's ability to capture that tail of the program and really make it into the bigger opportunity that's always been if you could capture that aftermarket strength?","Robert J. Stevens","Well, Myles, we, one, know the program pretty well, know the demands. Nobody wants to lower the total cost of operation of this airplane more than we do along with our customers. We see competition in every aspect of this business every day, and we certainly not only don't fear the competition, it actually makes us better. I think our customers realize that. So if there are competitive opportunities here that also lower the total cost of operation, we are certainly going to pursue them and pursue them aggressively. I think we have the insight that one would have from being the design agent and the prime contractor overseeing the supply chain. I think we are as able as anybody to provide very high-quality, very low-cost support service throughout the life cycle of this airplane. So we'll look forward to these discussions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Bob. Chris, a question regarding -- I guess when you were talking about the reorganization and taking cost out, and I can appreciate stripping out some of the management. But I'm surprised you're not seeing -- doing more I guess in IS&GS, given that, that's where you're seeing the most delay awards or scope reductions, and the customers have been focused on price. Is there opportunity there to continue to take cost out, or is it just not businesses that you want to break out for competitive reasons?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Peter. We think we've been very aggressive in taking out cost. I think back a couple of years, I think we had over 145,000 employees. We're currently at 120,000. We don't announce but we're happy to talk about the layoffs. There've been significant layoffs probably every quarter for the last 8 quarters. We highlighted this because of the reorganization, but we've streamlined over the years, I recall when IS&GS had about 11 different companies, if you will, or components, we're now down to 3, civil and defense and Intel line of business. We're very competitive. Bob mentioned, we look at our win rates on occasion when we lose competition. I'm not aware of any competition in IS&GS where we've lost as a result of cost. So again, we've done a fair amount. We'll continue to look at it. And of the $1.1 billion, I'm sure a couple of hundred million of that is coming out of the IS&GS. I just didn't differentiate it or highlight it for you.","Operator","The last question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congrats, Bob, on your last call.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Since I'm last, I'm going to try to sneak in 2 follow-ups to some of the other conversations you had. So the first one is with regard to the potential strategies with which sequestration could be avoided, Bob, I wonder, are there 1 or 2 kind of bigger things that are being discussed on the Hill that are floating to the top? And what are the high points of them, if there are? And then secondarily and separately, on the margin topic, you mentioned in your remarks you've had 6 or 7 years in a row with the segment operating margin above 11%. I basically wonder if you think you can repeat that. You've talked about the cost reductions and productivity improvements. On the other hand, you have a generally tougher customer, presumably these EAC adjustments wind down and become a headwind. Is that 11% kind of a reasonable longer-term margin, or does it need to come down?","Robert J. Stevens","Yes, I'll start with the discussion about strategies for sequestration. Of course, on the hill now, there is no discussion because we're in the recess prior to the election. To perhaps oversimplify this but maybe a little over simplification is good because it is really a complex set of scenarios right now. Three things -- one of 3 things will likely happen. We'll get a resolution or the grand bargain outcome, which tends to have value ranges of $4 trillion to $5 trillion, which is a significant amount of work that would go in, looking at tax, looking at entitlement, looking at spending. The onset of sequestration could be delayed beyond January 2 maybe to be coterminal with the CR in March or maybe beyond that or sequestration will take effect. My sense is the latter 2 are a little bit more likely than the first one. It would seem to be hard to get a grand bargain in a lame-duck session of the Congress. So my guess is we'll either see a delay of the onset or sequestration will take place. When you think about sequestration taking place, we already received from the Department of Defense additional planning guidance that we received on September 28 that said, they don't anticipate taking any contract actions on January 2. And they thought it was unlikely that they would take contract actions for several months beyond that, which puts us through our first fiscal quarter and puts the government into its second fiscal half before any impacts might be realized at least on the defense side. Civil government agencies are going to be different, and they don't have the large acquisition accounts, and a lot of their expenses are associated with people. So it's just not clear. I know every one of us wants to be in a position of doing better at predicting what will happen with respect to sequestration. But I can tell you, I don't know, and I don't know anybody who does know. There's a lot of speculation, but there's not greater clarity. So inside our company, we're preparing for the prospect of sequestration. As I said, we will issue WARN notices if that's required, if sequestration has reductions in force. We're working every day to try to avoid that. In the interim, we're asking our employees to stay very focused on the tasks at hand. And I think you see in the third quarter and in the year-to-date performance an exceptional quality by the talent in this company and their professionalism and staying focused on the goal, on the mission, on execution, and they are not being distracted by this. And for that, we are all so enormously proud of them for remaining focused like that. So the best we can do is try to keep you posted on how sequestration unfolds. Obviously, the next event would be what happens in the lame-duck session of Congress. Relative to margins, I do think that it is possible to sustain these margins over the long run, and we haven't given up on attempting to improve these margins. It has a lot to do with your portfolio. It has a lot to do with your business mix, and it has a lot to do with how well you're able to execute. And we make investments every day on building this portfolio to have real legs and real durability in a complex global security environment. We do focus every day on execution, and we're taking this business more broadly internationally and expect to have pretty robust opportunities to perform.","Bruce L. Tanner","So I'll just add, I think we are structurally different today and going forward than we were maybe a few years back, that has helped our situation as well. And Bob mentioned the international contact growing. I think that's one thing that contributes to the ability to maintain the 11%. We've talked a lot about our equity earnings. Those are companies that we did not have, I'll say, the margin boost from recognizing those equity earnings in years past, and that had -- sort of in the case of United Launch Alliance, that's sort of a double benefit  because you lost the sales associated with that activity. So the margin improvement was pretty substantial. The last thing I'll point to sort of a structural change is if you just think of all the combinations that led to the current Lockheed Martin, a number of those brought with them intangible amortizations associated with those acquisitions. And those were a drag on margins in the early years of this corporation as well that no longer exist as we sit here today. Bob?","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks. First, let me thank everybody for being on the call. We had a long day. You had a longer day. So we appreciate you being here with us. I certainly appreciate your kind words and all the good wishes you offered me. I was thinking that since I became our company's Chief Financial Officer in 1999, we've had about 52 quarters together to have these exchanges, and I have really enjoyed the interaction that we've all shared over the years. I want to wish each of you well in your professional pursuits and certainly in your personal lives. At this end, I'm certain our company is in great hands with Chris and Marillyn and Bruce and Jerry and the other members of the executive team. I'm really grateful for having the privilege of working on this management team and having had the opportunity to work with my fellow employees here who are simply exceptional people who do extraordinary work in the nation's interest. I will miss them, and I will miss you, but I will be listening to these calls. So I'm sure that Chris and Bruce look forward to talking with all of us in January. We'll sign off from this end. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"13064":["Lockheed Martin Corp.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kat, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016.","As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter operationally and financially. The corporation continued to track towards another year of strong financial results, while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transaction in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos. And I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.","Turning to the summary financials, our team continue to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, the second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full-year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. As a reminder the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.","Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos, significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another condition to closing. As we outlined on our press release last week, announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction.","As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the series of Lockheed Martin stock exchanged, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.","Switching to operational highlights, I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment.","We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho, where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability, using the latest version of the maturing software.","During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties, while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved zero avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues. The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year.","During the deployment test at the Mountain Home base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap in capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.","With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they recapitalize their fighter fleets. Looking at the production activity on the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft.","On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced blueprint for affordability, shared commitment between the government and industry.","To build upon that success, we announced two additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a two-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve lifecycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft.","Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment costs by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the five-year period, and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.","Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing with key events that included selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next generation fighter with a procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility and the arrival of the first two F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month, when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom.","Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program.","We are honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this next generation fighter for decades to come.","Turning to other areas in the corporation, a noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continued to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000 pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely, in day and night and all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit.","To date, we have delivered three CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our fighters and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries, in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.","I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter, at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost five years, before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly two years orbiting the planet, while studying the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetosphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation in making the impossible, possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success.","Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase have been superb. With the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's start with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter.","Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts.","We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned to the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.","On chart four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume which more than offset two fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year.","Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.","On chart five, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS\/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.","If you'll turn to chart six, we review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other core business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.","Turning to chart seven, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter.","Chart eight provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next two charts.","We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we're increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional at F-35 funding, as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business.","Chart nine provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics due primarily to higher than planned F-35 volume, and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated.","On chart ten, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first-half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better than planned performance to date.","Moving to chart 11, we have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year.","As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes a benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining two quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS, and combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year.","On chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.","Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS through closure will be moved to discontinued operations, as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate cost allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS' results and reflected as other unallocated cost in continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we will be filing pro forma financials.","Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts, and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the UK. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction.","Going forward, we will fully consolidate AWE's financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS\/CAS adjustment. So, you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October.","Finally, on chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers, and strong returns to our stockholders.","With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions.

And if you want to talk about any sort of longer-term implications from some of the recent activities there as it relates to the F-35, that would be helpful. Thanks so much.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I'll take that question and, Bruce, if you have anything you want to add, (22:30) do that. I think if you look at Turkey, I know there's been a lot of churn in Turkey here recently, but it still remains a very valued NATO partner for us, a NATO ally, and it's got \u2013 it's an essential security partner in that region for the United States and for our allies. So we look forward to continue our business relationship there and across the number of programs that we have.","We have not seen any indication that it will impact the F-35 or any of their other programs. And so, we'll continue to assess the situation and make sure that we'll share with you if there's any impact on our business. Their plan is to procure 100 F-35s, so they're a very important partner in that program. Bruce, anything you want to add?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Hunter, is we've got a long, long history with Turkey. We've worked with them since the pretty early days of the F-16 program. We've actually built F-16s in Turkey. As you know and the heart of your question, we're also doing parts of the F-35 at TUSAS Aerospace Industries in Turkey. That relationship has been successful. As you said, it's probably early to call what the grand implications are, but they've been, as Marillyn said, a trusted partner with Lockheed Martin for quite some time, and we hope that's the case in the future, obviously.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. Thank you, Pete.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","The F-35, the LRIP 9, 10 contract, you talked about the investment level growing dramatically in the coming months if it doesn't get signed, I think. Can you size that for us? And what's your sense of how close you are to the contract getting signed and are you definitely going to cash fund it if it doesn't close?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, let me give you just a little bit of color. It's a good question, Pete. And so, the current level, I think we disclosed in the earnings release. We've got nearly $1 billion or so that we're funding on the program, and that's a decision that we made to do that for whatever reason the U.S. Government has not decided to put funds that are authorized and appropriated to fund Lockheed Martin and our subcontractor efforts on the contracts.","So, we've been \u2013 we made the decision at the time that we were going to not allow a stop on the program and cause a disruption on the program, particularly in our supply base that's \u2013 since that's where most of the work is being done at this time on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts. So, we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. Government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future, because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels, we will not be able to sustain that. So that if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a Yucca (25:46) funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation, we simply don't have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I'm optimistic that we're going to get cash soon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Rich.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I know I usually ask the question about programs, but today, I have one on pension income and cash funding requirements. Now, if you would \u2013 relative to where rates were in \u2013 are in \u2013 were in 2015, I want to know if you could maybe discuss what you expect for 2017 for FAS\/CAS income. Also, can you give us maybe your best estimate regarding whether or not you're going to have a cash contribution to pension next year? If so, how much? Maybe you could give us a range on that. Anything you could give would be helpful.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll take that one, Rich. Thanks for the question. So, we're probably a little early to be talking about 2017. I think it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. And I think what our 10-year treasury is going for, 1.4% or thereabouts, so dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3\/8% or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line on the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not, but if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction in the FAS next year. Our asset returns, you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that it helped with that situation. So, if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS\/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, 2017 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016 still income from FAS\/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously.","As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more \u2013 ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of a instantaneous discount rate impact, where as ERISA is spread over time. So we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017, still zero.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Bruce, I think you talked the last quarter about 2018 pension contributions. And apologies for asking a question that's so far out in the future, but you said that you think you can fill most or if not, all of that gap. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail about \u2013 of the $1.5 billion in contribution, what's the cash tax benefit and then what are some of the other areas you see as helping you guys fill that gap?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Joe. So I actually plan to give a little more insight into the 2018 numbers probably in the October call, but let me take a shot at it now just because you asked the question. So, we have said that 2017, we talked about being the last of the three-year, what we call pension funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In the previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey \u2013 and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's floating around there maybe a little bit higher now.","But what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also \u2013 we'll get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018. So think of that as sort of 65% simplistically of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more philosophically just about capital allocation and share buyback. And I know you have a target of 300 million shares \u2013 or less than 300 million shares outstanding, but just trying to think about where the stocks multiple is now and just trying to think about how you factor that into what you do with your capital and whether that makes other alternatives more attractive than repurchasing shares.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me take a shot at that, Sam. So, it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend, capital allocations that we provided to shareholders. We have \u2013 if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably, I don't remember if 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry, I say it is 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income base. So, that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield. So, that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercise has actually slowed down quite a bit. If I remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough years ago, we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised, that level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well.","And then from that point, Sam, as usual, and this probably will not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense at least at this point is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as, in fact, it does. I'll remind you, and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million shares and 10 million shares at sort of current trading. And on top of that, we get the $1.8 billion special payment, as I talked about. And lacking a more pressing or \u2013 what's the word I'm looking for...","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Opportunistic.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Opportunistic. That's good work, Marillyn. Opportunistic use of that $1.8 billion, I would think a good chunk of that would probably go towards share repurchases.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm interested, Bruce said when \u2013 and you clearly had a very good quarter, and you said that it was a surprise to you all, I think, that the sales and your profitability were up as high as they were. Could you talk a little bit about that? Because if I look forward for the rest of the year, are these \u2013 is the surprise you had something that suggests your ongoing performance may actually be better perhaps than you've been expecting? And the guidance change doesn't really suggest that. So I'm just wondering what you took away from the quarter and what that means for the longer term.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's a good question, Doug. Look, I'm very happy with the first half of the year. And I don't know that if (36:08) that, but I used the word surprise, I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we got in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So, for instance, we had an Atlas or \u2013 excuse me, a Delta Heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off in the second quarter, that helped the earnings in the second quarter.","Things like that, again, for the first half of the year, all helped us. You were quizzing a little bit about while that didn't necessarily translate into the full-year, I'll say we kind of gave the first half performance and the outlook for the year, and we definitely have the opportunities that I think you're alluding to, Doug, in the second half of the year, but we have to make those happen. And sometimes things don't work out as planned, and that's probably the reason that we provided the guidance that we did. But nothing taken away from \u2013 we feel very, very good and pleased with the first half performance of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the \u2013 with a little more specificity on Aeronautics. I'm curious why the second half EBIT implied in the guidance is flat to maybe even down a touch versus the first half on higher volume, and then I think you're also recovering the restructuring expenses you had in the first quarter. So is there mix, is there something else maybe, Bruce, that you can help us explain why Aeronautics isn't going to outperform that guidance?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Good question, Myles. So, look, I kind of answered the question from Doug. I'd like to think that we have sort of, as I said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities. If I have a good second half as we have in the first half, the one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and a little bit of step-up on LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp rate there.","We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest \u2013 or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little wider probably than the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant \u2013 is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I talked about in the past. So, those two reasons probably both netted to F-35, one was the step-ups that occurred in the first-half; and secondly, excuse me, is just the volume in the second-half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Marillyn, you put one of your top managers at Sikorsky to run the business. Could you give us sort of a six-month read on where you are and how it's going? I mean, it looks to me like it's a little more expensive out of the box than one would have first thought.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're right about putting one of our top folks there. We have Dan Schultz who run large business areas for businesses for us in the past and also is a helicopter pilot out of the Marine Corps, so he knows the business extremely well and he's doing a great job there. I'll tell you, I'm really excited about a couple of things, Howard, that we've seen in the past six months. First off, we're tracking to what we had planned.","I mean, well, from your perspective, maybe different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were \u2013 I was at the Farnborough Airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed BLACK HAWK helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business, combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training, Sikorsky business, and showcasing that on \u2013 at our satellite area in Farnborough. And we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on \u2013 and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky, and that is to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business, but also \u2013 but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So, we're on track, we've talked before in this call about our commercial element Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that, and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Marillyn \u2013 or, Howard, just to add maybe a little bit to what Marillyn said relative to the armed BLACK HAWK, only because I think it's an interesting little tidbit there. So you should think of this as essentially taking a utility helicopter platform and essentially transitioning it into an attack platform. The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally, especially, is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day, you can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter.","That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace. And that's something that we think is very interesting that, frankly, would not have happened, but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the \u2013 our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now.","Operator","Thank you.

Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you. I guess where that stands right now is we're standing by with what we consider to be a very good offering. It's an excellent solution, it's low risk, it's \u2013 we've got it \u2013 it's the T-50A when our joint venture with Korean Aerospace, it's flying right now. We've already had our first flight of our offerings, so we've taken that T-50 with KAI and converted it into T-50A to meet the requirements that the Air Force has outlined, and we're excited about the fact that we've flown it, we're demonstrating it, and we think we have an excellent offering.","Now the RFP appears to be slipping out, it's slipping out into the December timeframe. So, we'll \u2013 I think that what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program, it's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with the tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is \u2013 I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that, it's \u2013 they need to replace that aircraft. And the fact that we have a low risk aircraft that's already flying that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean-sheet. And so, we like to compete and we think we have a tremendous offering.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, Bruce, a couple of quick things. Previously you had said that with the Leidos transaction that you would buy sufficient stock to offset the dilution. Given where the stocks are now, you'd probably have to use all of the $1.8 billion and maybe even to touch more to offset the dilution, so is that still the intent? And then second, you took about a $30 million charge, it looks like on the international contract that you alluded to in the Q1 document, and I was just wondering if you think that's the end of it? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thank you, George. So, relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not, you're right. At the call when we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the two years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at it today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So, pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we'd expected in the January call.","On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective, that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So, where we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders and we don't have regret on that. Notwithstanding the fact that to your point we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement, I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless that is where we are.","As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million. You're right. This is sort of the command and control business that we're looking, so think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country including identifying friend or foes, so that you don't have the wrong issues with the air missile defense capability, so linking into a lot of different systems. We think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains obviously with this.","And I think as we've gone through the development in early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously we'll keep you apprised as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract.","Operator","Thank you.

Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just going back to the F-35, Bruce, you've talked about double-digit margins I think in 2019 and in context with the two new initiatives that Marillyn spoke about that were announced last week, I guess it's around $430 million in new cost and clearly both you and the government are trying to get the best deal done here on 9 and 10. Is that still the trajectory, and how have margins been tracking lately?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, Rob, that is still the objective and, just a slight correction maybe on what you said that the two initiatives, sort of the second part of the Blueprint for Affordability and the sustainment activity is more like about $420 million. I remind you, this is an investment....","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Naturally....just go ahead, I'm sorry.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think your question, was that shared? And it is in fact shared between ourselves, Northrop Grumman and BAE, just as the first Blueprint for Affordability initiative was. It's hard to say, these are investments and you expect to get returns on your investments. We were getting a return on the Blueprint for Affordability one. We would expect to get returns on Blueprint for Affordability two as well as the sustainment investment that we're making. But notwithstanding that, I still think we're on a trajectory on the F-35 program. And I think I've said, more than having the specific year, it's relating more to when will we get full rate production that we hope to get to double-digit margins by that time. I've always said at similar points in time of the program's life cycle, it ought to look like an F-16 program or an F-22, or a C-130, there's sort of nothing structurally that would prevent us from getting to those levels. And right now, we're sort of tracking towards that trajectory, we've not come off of that at all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, David.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Bruce, hate to do it, but going back on pension, I think previously you had said FAS\/CAS for 2017, kind of all things staying the same discount rate hitting your assumed rate of return would be about a $450 million positive relative to 2016. So I want to clarify your answer on the prior pension question, where you talked about $350 million, are you talking about $350 million worth off of the projected 2017 level or off of the actual 2016 level? And then the other thing, the $1.8 billion that you're getting in conjunction with the closing on IS&GS, would you potentially look at that for an early pension contribution that potentially offset some of the downside? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah. Thanks, David. And I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that Fed reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we ran around in investor conferences and so forth, that I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly. So I tried to be clearer this time. Obviously, I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal-clear as I can on this thing.","So FAS\/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is, I would expect to be between, if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS\/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million dollar income number down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year. Almost all of that because of the discount rate change in the 1,000 basis \u2013 or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about.","Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a non-cash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all. And that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and we would use that to pre-fund the pension plan. The answer is, we don't have that expectation sitting here today and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the \u2013 to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got quite honestly a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts and we don't see the point at this time of sort of increasing that level.","Operator","Thank you.

So in the quarter, you had a reasonable book-to-bill of 0.85 at IS&GS and yet my understanding is that that number excluded the FAA contract you got recently and the protested ISR award you had in the second quarter. As you \u2013 and yet, you also mentioned the Australian contract had another schedule delay. Can you update us, as you look at next year, what the IS&GS, any color on where the IS&GS numbers might be?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Cai, I think that's probably across \u2013 against an area where we're better suited to point you to the prospectus that we got for the RMT transaction rather than me comment on what IS&GS sales would look like under Lockheed Martin in 2017 when that's not our expectation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning Marillyn and Bruce.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a question on the F-35, just to clarify and a second part, the sustainment initiative on reducing those costs. You said 10% reduction there or $1 billion in five years implies a \u2013 clearly a very large sustainment amount, a $10 billion amount. That seemed kind of large, I just wondered if you could clarify if that was correct?","And then secondly, with respect to the contract action, if you end up getting a UCA on this, in the coming quarter or two quarters, Bruce, is there a particular cost or margin impact to one contract outcome versus another that you're considering in your guidance or in the plan? How should we think about that in terms of how that that gets finalized with the customer. Thanks.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With the point to the question, Carter, let me just take the first one on the Blueprint...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...for Affordability for sustainment. What we announced was an investment of up to $250 million over the next couple of years, much like we did on Blueprint for Affordability for production, this time for sustainment along with BAE and Northrop Grumman. And we're targeting over that five-year period that we would reduce sustainment cost by 10%. So, that's where the $1 billion dollar savings for that five-year period would come from. We've got a lot of projects that we've outlined and so it will be jointly with the U.S. government. They will approve those projects, we'll implement them and then as Bruce said earlier, we will get a return on our investment. I think that answers that question, unless there's something more there, Bruce, that you want to add.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing to that. I'll try to address the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10. So, maybe a little bit more than you want, Carter, but \u2013 so yeah, there's sort of two ways that we could get cash recovery on this program. One is through what's called an undefinitized contractual action or UCA, you've heard that term obviously in the past. We don't care frankly how we get the cash. If it comes under a UCA though, UCAs get funded essentially and it allows you to bill against the UCA with progress payments. So, we would not recover as much cash under a UCA Although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would have if we actually definitized the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10, we would expect to have performance-based payments and performance-based payments where we are on the contract today would actually give us greater cash recovery than with the UCA. I hope that made sense.","As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing and we have raised this with the government is, depending on how long this shortfall lasts and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be \u2013 if we choose to fund and again avoid the disruption of the, particularly the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are. And that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if in fact that takes place with the government.","So, a potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there potentially could be some consideration for that. If in fact that's what happened, but that is not our plan as I said.","Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations","Kat, this is Jerry. I think we've come up on top of the hour here. So, I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jerry. Well, as we conclude the call today, I want to wrap up again by highlighting that the corporation completed an exceptional quarter and we continue to build on our year-to-date momentum with an increasing DoD budget and a robust backlog. The corporation is positioned for top-line growth and strong cash flows in the future.","Thank you again for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in October.

Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin I want to offer my appreciation and congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their continuing outstanding performance and the achievement of strong second quarter financial and operational results. As we continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging environment, their efforts and focus have our Corporation poised for continued success in delivering value to shareholders and solutions to customers. While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later, I\u2019ll highlight some key financial achievements from the quarter that included growing earnings per share to $2.64, 11% above last year's second quarter level, expanding segment operating margin to a record level 13.4% and achieving an increase of 110 basis points above last year's level and generation of $600 million in cash from operations after making $750 million in pension contributions.","Our continued strong cash flow is foundational to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. In the second quarter, we repurchased over 4.5 million shares of our stock, more than double the 2.2 million shares we pre-purchased in the second quarter last year. We deployed $465 million for share repurchase through this quarter and paid slightly over $370 million in dividends. Through the first half of 2013, we returned over $1.6 billion or approximately 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, I would characterize the second quarter financial performance as broad based across all business areas with results exceeding our expectations. This strong performance enabled us to increase our 2013 financial guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Bruce will cover some of the specific drivers for the improved performance in his briefing. ","Before discussing other achievements this quarter, I\u2019d like to outline the status of DOD budgets. Since we last spoke in April, not much has changed in the budget environment. FY13 DOD budget appropriations have been enacted and incorporate the $37 billion in budget reductions required under sequestration. Our sum budget reduction actions are being implemented by the government, they have to implement most of the required spending cuts. To date, we have seen minimal impact to our portfolio programs with actions taken primarily limited to our shorter cycle business.","Customers are continuing to determine how they will implement the cuts mandated by sequestration, which they\u2019re required to do before the end of the fiscal year on September 30th. And we are working closely with them as they explore host of potential scenarios.","For FY \u201914, Congressional deliberations on the budget are continuing. The President proposed baseline defense budget remains at $526 billion without inclusion of the $52 billion in sequestration budget reduction that went into effect in March 2013.","The Department of Defense has finalized the Strategic Management Review that reexamined policy and program priorities to account for the sequestration imposed cuts. This review will be used to aide DoD and continuing to formulate decisions on post-sequestration program and budgets for 2013 and 2014.","Our future budget levels remain uncertain, the strategic need and support of number of our key programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, littoral combat ship and C-130J remains intact. We will continue to work with customers and respond the changes as required when budget positions are finalized by the government.","Turning to the operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional focus and skill in providing critical products and services to customers. Of the numerous accomplishments in the quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight our continued success in missile defense activities, provide a status of our expanding international work and finish with an update on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.","First, with the growing threat of ballistic missile proliferation, the need for proven, reliable, interceptor systems is becoming more acute daily, providing defense system design to prevent the catastrophic damage that can be inflicted on civilian population centers and national infrastructure by offensive missile is essential to our nation and alliance.","Our portfolio of interceptor system consisting of Aegis, Patriot, THAAD and MEADS will provide layered coverage intended to defeat missile press post by world nations.","This quarter, our Patriot 3 missile conducted a ripple fire test that successfully intercepted and destroyed two different targets at White Sands Missile Range. This test was the first time a multi-target engagement was performed against both the Ballistic Missile Target and the Cruise Missile Target, and it success provide a clear demonstration of the design maturity and increasing capability of the PAC-3 configuration.","In addition to the Patriot test events, our Second Generation Aegis Ballistic Missile System successfully launched and guided a missile to engage and destroy a separating short-range Ballistic Missile Target. This test validated the ability of the Aegis system to engage increasingly more challenging enemy threat.","It also marked an important milestone for the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. This approach will combine a land based Aegis Ashore site in Romania with a traditional Aegis system aboard navy ships to provide unique missile defense protection on the continent.","These multiple successful launch again demonstrates the accuracy, robustness and technological advances we are incorporating into our missile defense products. These advances will ensure we can provide defense system to customers that can respond to an ever evolving threat. With customers depending on these systems in their times of need, it is an honor and responsibility to provide affordable and proven systems for our nation and alliance.","The next area I want to highlight is the continued expansion of our international business portfolio. This quarter we secured new awards and made deliveries to new customers as we extended our international presence.","New awards were received across multiple business areas and consisted of aeronautics receipt, I mean, award for 18 additional F-16 aircraft for Iraq. This award now extends the F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas well into 2017.","Mission systems and training secured new award for Japan to upgrade Aegis Multi-Mission Signal Processor and other equipment on their Ballistic Missile Defense Ship. Missiles and Fire Control received multiple international awards and clearly had order from Saudi Arabia to provide longbow fire control radars for attacked helicopters, an order from Finland to provide integration support of our JASSM Missile into Finnish Fighter Aircraft, an award to provide Patriot Missile Defense Equipment to Kuwait.","International deliveries in the quarter consisted of delivery of the first C130J Super Hercules aircraft to both the Republic of Tunisia and to Israel. The delivery to Tunisia marks the first to an African country, an entry into a new customer set. Tunisia becomes the 15th country to select the proven, low risk and affordable C130J for its air fleet requirement. Expansion of international sales remains a key component of our corporate strategy. And we're on a path to grow international content from approximately 17 total sales last year to at least 20% in the next few years.","Finally turning to the F-35 program, multiple key accomplishments were achieved in the quarter. And you can feel the momentum accelerating throughout the program. Last month I attended the F-35 CEO roundtable in Fort Worth, chaired by Frank Kendall, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Logistics and the programs status briefing by Lieutenant General Bogdan, the F-35 Program Executive Officer. Attendees included Representatives from all nine-partner nations and our teammates on the F-35 industry team.","The meeting reaffirmed just how much progress the F-35 team has made. The customer expressed a renewed confidence in the future of the program and there is a strong sense of partnership across the whole team. We know a lot of work still must be done and at the same time, it\u2019s clear that the tremendous efforts of the team are paying off. ","One of the key accomplishments this quarter was the declaration by the Department of Defense of initial operating capability dates for all three F-35 variants, 2015 for the Stovall aircraft, 2016 for the CTOL aircraft and either late 2018 or early 2019 for the CD aircraft for the U.S. Navy. These dates reflect the confidence the customer has in the Lightning 2 and in our team. Our job is to execute on the program, to make sure we meet these critical dates for our customers and deliver the capabilities of this aircraft to our warfighters and allies. ","Beyond the establishment of IOC dates, the program achieved a number of key milestones in the second quarter including the delivery of the first F-35C carrier variant to the U.S. Navy. This delivery was important as all three variants are now at Elgin Air Force Base, Florida, where they're training pilots and maintenance personnel for this next generation fighter; completion of high angle of attack testing by the F-35A which is a key measure of aircraft maneuverability; completion of the first vertical take-off by an F-35B Stovall aircraft and the successful first in-flight missile launch by the F-35A variant. Production activities continue to ramp up with delivery of 12 aircraft in the quarter. And we remain solidly on track to deliver at least 36 aircraft this year. The program tempo is accelerating and we currently have our 100 aircraft in final assembly. ","In the area of customer relationships and contractual events, we were pleased with the Australia\u2019s reconfirmation of its plans to procure 100 CTOL joint strike fighters for its national defense. We look forward to reviving these revolutionary aircraft to one of our key strategic partnering countries. As we continued to work to bring down the cost of the aircraft, we were pleased with reduction in acquisition and operating and support costs reflected in the 2012 Selected Acquisition Report issued by the DoD in June. This was the first year the cost reduction was noted since program inception and we will work with the F-35 Joint Program Office to implement further cost savings measures to secure additional decreases in the total program cost. The top priority of the government and the contractor team is to continue to cost effectively build and deliver the F-35\u2019s unprecedented fifth generation capabilities to the warfighter. ","I\u2019ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our financial performance and then we\u2019ll open it up the line for questions. ","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. My comments will refer to the web charts that we included in our earnings release today if you would like to follow along. Let's start with Chart 3, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.4 billion, 4% below our results from a year ago, but higher than our first quarter results and as with the first quarter were above our expectations. Segment operating margin was as record 13.4%, a 110 basis points improvement over the second quarter last year. Our earnings per share were also up significantly to $2.64, an 11% increase over last year\u2019s results.","We generated $623 million in cash from operations well above the outlook I provided in the first quarter. We returned over $800 million of cash to our shareholders including the repurchase of 4.5 million shares for $465 million. And as a result of our performance, we\u2019re increasing our outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So we\u2019re very pleased with our results for the first half of the year.","Chart four shows our sales in the second quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautic sales equaled our results last year as lower quantities of F-16, F-22 and C-130 aircraft were offset by higher volume on F-35 production contracts and C-5 deliveries. IS&GS sales were lower due to reduced volume primarily in our intelligence line of business.","Missiles and Fire Control continued their strong performance with an 11% increase from sales coming primarily from air and missile defense programs. Mission Systems and Training sales were down 12% due primarily to the end of deliveries of the PTDS program last year. And finally, space systems was 13% lower than last year due primarily to the delivery of two commercial satellites from the second quarter of last year and none this year.","Moving to chart five in our segment operating results, despite our sales being down 4%, operating profit was up 4% driven by the significant improvement in operating margin of 13.4%. At the end of this quarter, we had strong program execution across all of our business areas that we\u2019ll show in the next chart.","Chart six shows our segment operating margins by business area. Three of our five business areas increased operating margin compared to the second quarter of last year with MST having the largest increase due to the settlement of certain contractual matters and better performance in our training and logistics business.","Missiles and Fire Control continue to have excellent results and the increase this quarter was due to improved performance in air and missile defense programs, tactical missile programs and fire control programs. Space system\u2019s margin improved primarily due to the increased equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, reflecting the mix of launch related activities in the quarter compared with last year.","IS&GS\u2019 margin was flat relative to last year\u2019s second quarter results and aeronautic\u2019s margin was down this quarter due to the absence of a favorable contractual resolution on the F-22 program which occurred in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the contractual resolution, aeronautic\u2019s margin were similar to last year.","Moving onto chart seven. Our EPS grew 11% over the results from the second quarter of last year to $2.64 per share due primarily to improved operational performance. And on our pension adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.87 per share.","We\u2019ll turn to chart eight. We\u2019ll discuss our cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We returned over $800 million to shareholders in the quarter with share repurchases in excess of dividends paid. Compared with the second quarter of last year, we repurchased more than double the amount of shares. With the increase in our stock price in the quarter, we saw higher level of option exercise and accordingly, we repurchased additional stock to mitigate share count dilution.","On chart nine, we\u2019ll look at cash return to shareholders on a year-to-date basis. We had a strong year-to-date cash -- we had strong year-to-date cash from operations of $2.7 billion and free cash flow of over $2.4 billion.","Through the first half, we returned almost $1.7 billion or nearly 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And our share repurchases of over $900 million will exceed the level of dividends paid thus far in the year and greatly exceed to roughly $700 million have seen in our full-year guidance at the start of the year.","Moving onto chart 10, we will discuss our updated view of guidance for the year. As was the case last quarter, we saw minimal impact to our sales in the second quarter as a result of sequestration actions and we are maintaining the sales guidance provided last quarter.","On the other hand, we are increasing our outlook for segment operating profit by $225 million to recognize the strong performance to the first half of the year. As a result of the increase in our segment operating profit, we are also increasing our outlook for earnings per share by $0.40 to a new level of $9.20 to $9.50 per share and also reflecting strong performance thus far. We are increasing our cash from operations guidance by $200 billion to a new level of greater than or equal to $4.2 billion.","Chart eleven shows our updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We\u2019re increasing our outlook in four to five business areas. MFT\u2019s outlook is now $75 million higher, Missiles and Fire Control\u2019s is now $70 million higher and both Aeronautics and Space are $40 million higher than our guidance last quarter. And turning to chart twelve I\u2019ll summarize by noting that we\u2019re very pleased with the results for the first six months of the year and they reflect our program execution, the strength of our portfolio and the focus of our work force during these dynamic times.","With that, we\u2019re ready for your questions, Sahid.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And in the interest of time, we\u2019re limiting each to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow up questions. Our first question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the order outlook, obviously the book-to-bill was about 0.8 by my calculation and it looks like obviously you have a plan to have a pretty big step up there in Q3 and Q4 to hit the levels you talked about on the previous call. You said you haven\u2019t really still seen any impact from sequester, but I wondered if you could give us an update on your expectations for orders and if anything\u2019s changed and for last quarter and how about that will shape up for what you\u2019re thinking about 2014? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, thanks Carter. So I\u2019ll start up by saying, actually we\u2019re slightly ahead of where we probably would be at this point of second quarter. I tried to key that up. I think either the first quarter or the top end of the year last year. But we\u2019re actually tracking that of expected or slightly ahead of plan. There\u2019s up several items and I ask, probably just kind of run down the list by business area, just give you an idea of what we\u2019re expecting to happen over the next few quarters.","So the second biggest item obviously is the closure of the last six and seven negations for F-35 and when that happens Carter, I mean think of the increase in orders as being somewhere in the $4.5 to $5 billion amount for just that one closure of contract negotiations if you will. And we\u2019re expecting that to happen in the third quarter. Aren\u2019t we making good progress that, Marillyn can fill-in some of the details for you if you\u2019d like at a later point in the call?","We also have a number of competitive orders. We\u2019re watching an MST in the third quarter including Space Fence and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Program AMDR. We also have an Aegis order for the basic Aegis program, collectively those are about a billion dollars again that we\u2019re expecting in the third quarter. Missiles and Fire Control has both domestic and an FMS order for the THAAD program that\u2019s expected in the third quarter, so I think of this as the annual buy from the army on the domestic side and one of our international customers tagging on for that order. And that\u2019s -- I think I said worth about a $1.5 billion in the third quarter. IS&GS is usual, is nothing -- no one program individually significant, but the third quarter is expected to be higher than either the second or the first. And then, Carter, as we look forward I would expect that the fourth quarter as usual will be our highest quarter of the year. ","Now just to sort of summarize all that, I think the third quarter -- you should think of us probably being back at a level maybe slightly higher than where we are or where we were in the first quarter and if all comes as I just laid out including some of those competitions, we should end the year pretty close back about at the $80 billion like I\u2019ve been talking about the past two quarters.","Carter Copeland, Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Just Bruce or Marillyn and this could go to both of you, but I wanted to just talk about what we learned in the interim between last call and this call from DOD on sequester. I think about $1 billion was taken from 2013 money for F-35 and it appears to cut, I think five aircrafts from the air force and about two from the navy and the marine core with the reminder of the billion being RDT&E. So to what extent if at all does this impact LRIP-6 and probably more likely LRIP-7 negotiations? And how should we think about that those Lot seven aircraft from the 29 aircraft originally funded in \u201913?","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question Rob. First, I\u2019d say that, our customer really has not come out with a definitive position on how they\u2019re going to take into account sequestration. I know there has been lot of speculation. I\u2019m not going to speculate with you on what they\u2019ll come out with.","We\u2019re working closely with them. They\u2019re looking at different scenarios of how they are, if they\u2019ll address it. One thing I will say is that they\u2019re very supportive of the F-35 and we\u2019ll just have to see how it comes out.","We\u2019ve seen in terms of any impact that we might see on F-35 that we backfill probably by international opportunities because as you can see that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to ramp up. In fact, we look over the next five years close to 50% of our orders will come from international customers. So we\u2019ve got to just wait until they come forward with or wait until the Department of Defense comes forward with what their plans are and then we\u2019ll adjust accordingly.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Rob, I\u2019d like to just add a little bit to what Marillyn said. I think the negotiations on six and seven were clearly targeted to sort of keep the quantities sort of pre-sequestration. So think of the negotiations that we hope to close fairly quickly here as being the same quantities we have embedded within the fiscal year themselves not adjusted for sequestration.","And I think Secretary Kendall has been pretty vocal in the press about trying to keep quantities and trying to prevent sort of the reopening of contracts. And so we\u2019re optimistic if that kind of plays out well for that negotiation that were not impacted to the level that you talked about.","As Marillyn said, we\u2019re watching the FY14 budget closely but at least, as we\u2019ve sort of done comparisons in particular the President\u2019s budget, there seems to be more reductions to non-aircrafts elements of the program than aircraft programs, which we think from a sort of a billed rate in bringing the overall cost profile of the program down is the right move from obviously our perspective.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So, Bruce, if I want to understand what you both just said, it\u2019s not so much about quantities, it\u2019s more about total dollars and these dollars don\u2019t necessarily come off of unit price but from other areas of the program?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. I think you said it just right, Rob. In fact, I\u2019ve said in a media that this morning and I think I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks that we\u2019ve seen less impact from sequestration sort of red large than we expected to through this part of the year. I\u2019ll say frankly from our perspective, I can\u2019t speak obviously for all of the industry, but I think the Pentagon Secretary, all the way, up and down to Pentagon has been very prudent in the way that they\u2019ve managed the sequestration impacts and I think they\u2019ve done a very nice job doing that from an industry\u2019s perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citigroup.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","Good morning, everyone. Bruce \u2026","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","Bruce, this question is for you, in the slide deck you\u2019ve got a line in there on chart nine that says you are on track to exceed full year cash return commitments. You\u2019ve done that on the repurchases the $926 million versus the $700 million, but keeping in mind that the goal here was to keep the share count roughly by an offset dilution? So can you just provide a little bit more update on what exactly you mean by on track to exceed for your expectations, is that around the share count itself or is that a comment more around the $900 million versus the $700 million?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Probably neither actually, Jason, it is more of our long standing goal is to give 50% of more free cash flow. I\u2019ll say we pretty much get there, obviously we just did and so, in fact I was saying, did $700 million plus the dividends for the year. So we\u2019ve exceeded that already on a year-to-date basis.","And I think probably embedded your question is so what is the outlook looks like for the rest of the year and how does that expect to play out. I\u2019ve got to believe with the stock sitting where it is today in the level of options that have been exercised to date that those will continue if the stock stays where it is today. It\u2019s actually up a couple dollars at least last I looked at it today, which will probably continue that trend and just to give you some perspective there, we\u2019ve had 4 million, we had 4 million options exercised in the second quarter of 2013 compared to just over 1 million in the second quarter of 2012.","So, you know if that trend continues that will be obviously the motivation for us to continue to share repurchases at the level we\u2019ve had in the past but that will be dependent upon us watching that option exercise and its effect of the dilution of the share count. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Good morning. ","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning. ","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Rob. ","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","(Inaudible) a follow-up of Jason\u2019s question. If you're obliged to carry on buy back stock at this sort of rate, does this jeopardize or impact on your first ability to increase the dividend debt force? ","Bruce Tanner","Well, I guess you can\u2019t do that to infinity without impacting the ability to pay dividends back, Rob, but honestly I don\u2019t think, you know, if you look at our track record, in terms of what we\u2019ve done with dividend increases and you know, I think that\u2019s probably always the best indicator of what we\u2019ll do in the future. The one thing that\u2019s kind of interesting about where we sit from the amount of options that are still outstanding and have yet to be exercised, I want to say there is about $15 million, 15 million, excuse me, shares of options that are outstanding, about 12.5 or so are vested and the other, the remainder unvested. But we\u2019ve kind of weeded out, if you will, sort of the low dollar option amounts. So the options that are being exercised today come with, you know, option prices at the $80 plus per share for the most part. ","So you know think of the incremental difference between sort of buying back the shares to offset the dilution and the price of the options that are being exercised is maybe less than they would have been years ago when we had some options at the $35 to $45 levels. So that\u2019s something to mitigate. What you might think of in terms of the overall level of cash sort of required to continue to share repurchases. At this point I think we\u2019ve got the flexibility to do that. we're still looking at, you know, with the guidance we\u2019ve provided this year, $4.2 billion, our overall capital, you know, somewhere in the billion dollars, maybe a little less. So free cash flow of $3.2 billion we started out, I think we\u2019ve got what, $2.8 billion on the balance sheet as we ended the quarter. ","So, you know, I still think we\u2019ve got the fire power to continue to do that going forward in part because of the reasons I\u2019ve just said with the benefits coming from those options when they are exercised. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. ","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning everybody. ","Bruce Tanner","Good morning. ","Bruce Tanner","Hey, [Tom].","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","If I move to the low end of the revenue guidance range which you\u2019ve indicated would happened under sequestration for 2013, the back half of the year would experience something like an 8% organic revenue decline. In that, what is your assumption for the growth rate of U.S. DoD versus U.S. non-DoD versus international? And then to extend you're willing or able to, you know, can you talk about how much different we should assume those would be in 2014, if at all?","Bruce Tanner","Help me with the last part of your question, Noah, if you would. Please tell me more about what you're looking for, the comparison of \u201914 to \u201913, what was that?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Yes. Basically what I\u2019m saying is you know is there any reason why we should not take those growth rates you\u2019ve assumed in the back half of \u201913 and carry them forward into \u201914 in the center or sequestration as [stepping].","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So I think the first part of your question was if we could kind of squeeze for the back half of the year, it looks like we're down, I think you said 8%. I think that\u2019s about right. Noah, I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head. I will say that if we, as I said, to answer a previous question, as we look at the overall year and where we sit to the first half of the year, our sales were ahead of expectations in the first quarter. Our sales were ahead of expectations in the second quarter albeit not as much as they were in the first quarter. So we are tracking better than expected for the first half.","The $825 million that we kind of came up with point towards the low end of the guidance was sort of -- as we used in the past sort of a parametric or a mathematically derived number that frankly we haven't seen materialize as quickly or as much as we thought when we did that calculations.","So, I\u2019m hopeful that we actually -- our culture towards the -- maybe little bit higher than the low end of the guidance, as we said earlier -- as I said earlier we\u2019ve got one quarter to kind of squeeze out the fiscal year \u201813 impact for sequestration. It seems like a lot has to happen that quarter for that sort of mathematical modeling to come into fruition.","As far as the build rates going into 2014, I think, we\u2019re very similar to the situation that we were going into fiscal year 2013 in the -- we haven't seen truly the impacts in \u201813 than we had expected in large part because again I think the DoD in the Pentagon has done a fairly masterful job kind of deflecting some of that. It\u2019s some of the expensive of operations and maintenance and some readiness issues, which are not good by any means, but in terms of the industry's perspective I think it\u2019s been helpful.","And so, we are kind of going to go into \u201814 somewhat the way we went into 2013 and there I think the -- we are going to have a similar story as I said at the start of the year where our long cycle businesses will not see much impact even if the \u201814 budget is set by sequestration. And our short cycle businesses will have that impact. But I got to believe the ability to continue to differ and push the sequestration impacts on O&M, readiness and the like will be mitigated by \u201814. So I think \u201814 versus \u201813 will be similar to what we expected to kind of happen as we enter the year \u201813 if that makes sense.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.","Rich Safran - Buckingham Research","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Rich Safran - Buckingham Research","This question is either for Marillyn or Bruce. Marillyn on your comments regarding at on second tranche of the F-16 and extending the backlog to \u201917. Now, I want to know if you could comment on other opportunities for the F-16 and maybe also if you could make the comment here about what you are thinking about in terms of production rates? And as long as on maybe legacy programs here, maybe you could also comment on the opportunities and the outlook for the 130J in production rates?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure, thanks for the question. So, on opportunities for F-16 as I did say with the Iraq sale that gets us out into 2017. But we also have opportunities and import for the UAE. Potentially, there are other Middle East countries. We have opportunities in South America. So, our production rate today is about 13 aircrafts per year. And it should continue on out through at least to \u201817 timeframe. And then as we see additional orders come on line, we would continue to stay on whatever rate that would lend itself to.","We also have F-16 upgrade work that we are doing today which is good work for us as we, with the time line upgrade of F-16. On the C-130J, our plan this year is to deliver 24 aircrafts and we\u2019ll continue on that rate. We have a lot of international demand for this C-130J. And we are hopeful on moving through the multi-year opportunity with the U.S. government which would be up to 83 aircraft through those opportunities in Saudi Arabia, opportunities in India. So we have the C-130J also has good opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol from JP Morgan.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Thanks. Very nice margins. I have actually just two quick ones. One is, Bruce, you talked earlier about the backlog in what you expect to happen by the end of the year, about $80 billion. Funded backlog, does that look at a similar profile that they were due at 55. Do -- I think at the end of last year, do you expect that to be roughly the same?","And then the second question is just on the F-35 SDD. You took another reduction, profit rate reduction in the quarter. Could you just give some color on how you think that tease you up going forward on that contract, what has to happen to make that the last write down? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","","Thanks Joe. I\u2019ll try to take both those on. The backlog, as you said and we\u2019re looking for a total backlog of $80 billion or so by the end of the year. I think we are around $55 billion or so of funded backlog. I wouldn\u2019t think -- I think I would think that relationship will sort of hold pretty steady, would be my guess. Maybe a little bit higher, like think about it because I would think we\u2019d get full funding for a good portion of that lot [6 and 7] negotiation, so that on a percentage basis, it might actually be a little higher than it is today. And as far as the SDD, you\u2019re right. We did take a [D-book] this year, essentially similar to the one we took a year ago at this timeframe.","The way I would describe that Joe, is in the quarter, we finalized an agreement with the government which we\u2019ve been working for quite some time for the plan for earning the remaining fee on SDD and you should think of that as being both for the remaining developmental milestones on the contract as low as sort of an overall measure of performance that\u2019s an incentive based measurement that will take place at the end of the contract. And I\u2019ll just say that both criteria, the developmental milestone, they\u2019re linked to specific dates and accomplishments through the remainder of the SDD period. And even more so I\u2019ll say the sort of overall performance measures at the end of the contract which you should think of as being tied to both schedule performance and cost performance between now and the end of the contract.","Both of those, I would characterize as very tough criteria for us. So this is our best estimate of how we\u2019re going to perform against that criteria. I\u2019d like to say that this is -- obviously I think this is our best estimate of how we\u2019d perform against that criteria and it is a little tough maybe than what we were thinking it was when we set the numbers a year ago just on \u2026","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel.","William R. Loomis - Stifel","","Thank you. Just staying on F-35; Bruce, you talked about the productions, the quantities are still undecided. But just from a revenue standpoint of the work you\u2019re doing, is it still running about 15%, can we expect that to continue? And then just another questions on IS&GS with the backlog showing sequential decline and you\u2019ve got two big wins last year with GSM and [Pulver] and we\u2019re still declining. When do you think we might see some stability in IS&GS? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Hey, Bill. I\u2019ll answer those. So we are about 15% of total revenue for the F-35 program. I think that number continues to increase over the next few years. I think we were somewhere in the 13-ish or so range. I\u2019ve lost track where we were last year. So we had about a 2% increase if memory serves me right in the percentage of total F-35 compared to our total sales. That number again, I think increases going forward and then how much I would say, maybe not as much as the 13% to 15%, but still increasing between 2013 and 2014.","","IS&GS, the sequential decline again, kind of as expected and the reversal I think that you talked about Bill, this is still a business that\u2019s very much sort of orders similar to or excuse me, backlogs similar to the sales level. For us to get there, we would expect to have a greater fourth quarter which is the historical trend for IS&GS. And what I would expect to have happened is that we\u2019ll see from an orders perspective, higher orders in both the third quarter than we saw in the first two and the fourth quarter will be higher still than the third quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","","Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.","Marillyn Hewson","","Good morning.","","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","","Bruce, maybe this question is for you or maybe Marillyn can take it. Just in general headcount levels, you guys have been out front on reducing your overall cost base quite a bit over the last couple of years and according to my calculation looks like headcount has come down by about 8% during that period. I mean, you are still seeing a lot of opportunities for that whether it\u2019s early retirement programs or productivity, or just in general mandated by the overall budgets? Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","Okay. We have taken net cap down from about 146,000 employees about two or three years ago to 116,000 now, so you are right, headcount has been coming down. We\u2019ve taken some direct activities where we took out a number of management back when we do our voluntary separation program at that time. We will continue to adjust our business to what\u2019s happening and our business base.","So that\u2019s what you are seeing is just the budget environment and adjusting to contractual delays or reductions that come with that. So those are the types of actions we\u2019ll take and what we don\u2019t know is what sequestration will bring. Certainly, if we have a significant impact on program from sequestration we\u2019ll see additional reductions to that. So we basically saw the business to the environment that we are operating in.","We are also coming out of footprint. We\u2019ve done a lot and you\u2019ve probably seen we reduced our capacity both shutting down facilities, as well as moving out lease space into our own space and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done for past several years. But it\u2019s just of course we take to managing our business to make sure that we get our infrastructure and our labor force aligned with business base that we have.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Quick one and then one on pension, well, the quick one is the EACs revisions not related to revenue for the year, it looks like coming roughly flat year-on-year is that currently what\u2019s built into the guidance?","And then one on pension, Bruce, if you can kind of give us little color, obviously the rates moving higher here, it\u2019s going to help you pretty significantly if you stick around. I think on a sensitivity basis like as a potentially $300 million, $400 million help for you for next year versus what you previously told us. As well, can you comment on that if that changing your attitude towards cash contributions, the remaining $750 million, still have as discretionary for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Myles. So EAC revisions, I think, as usual Myles your math is right, we\u2019re kind of spot on maybe a slightly different little bit down from the first half of this year compared to the first half of the last year in terms of our overall EAC revisions.","Looking forward for the rest of this year, the second half, at least in the plan we kind of expected the level that will be similar to a little bit higher than where we were last year and that could obviously change as sort of risk retirements happen quicker than we plan them obviously.","But as we sit here today, overall, we would expect still be, I think last year we were about 34% overall our EAC revisions versus our total earnings, so we\u2019re going to be right at ballpark, maybe a little higher at 35-ish or just 36% is kind of what I would expect to see.","So on pension you asked about the discount rates or the interest rate changes and so forth and I\u2019ll just -- I\u2019ll give you a little bit of perspective, obviously we won\u2019t set this until the end of the year. But clearly there have been changes to rates in the first half of the year that want some discussion.","So interest rates so far are up, probably about 75 basis points, and our asset returns are also slightly positive as we sit here this year. But as you know, our pension adjustments that we\u2019re talking about much more sensitive to changes in the interest rates than changes in our asset return.","So you did some calculations just remind everyone else on the call. I think the sensitivity that we provided in previous 10-Q and 10-K filings are still appropriate. So for discount rates every 25 basis points change is worth about a $145 million change in our FAS expense, whereas for asset returns it takes a 400 basis points change to be about an $18 million change in our FAS expense.","So, overall, if we were to set the market today, we would expect to have a positive adjustment to fast cash again if those results held. I would remind that between now and the end of the year we typically do sort of accrual settings that look at the current population of employees to see what has changed and that population as we do reductions in force, you know some of the dynamics of that accrual study do actually change in terms of the acquisition of the workforce that, upon which that liability is built upon. ","One of the bigger changes that and it may not happen between now and the end of the year, but we're watching it closely as we are expecting a new sort of standard mortality rate to come out which I guess from a good news perspective, since all of us are going to live longer, sort of from the bad news perspective, it says your liabilities are likely going to be increasing per pension because people are living longer. So that will have a bit of a mitigating effect on what we just described there in the numbers that she said but again we\u2019ll set that up. We\u2019ll try to give you the same sort of preview, if you will, in the third quarter call that we do typically every single year. And that\u2019s when I\u2019ll give you probably a little more detail into that. ","As far as cash contributions, we\u2019ve actually already made in the third quarter the second tranche of the $750 million for a total of $1-1\/2 billion pension contribution. So, that is done for the year and we\u2019ll, you know, as usual, we always evaluate whether or not the need arises to do anymore towards the end of the year when we sort of see our cash from operations flung out on a four year basis. We\u2019ll try and give you some insights into that, Miles, again when we talk again in the third quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I think this is kind of a two-part question, half for Bruce and half for Marillyn. If we look at the outlook for you, Bruce, and we kind of split the revenue forecast and look at what you\u2019ve done for segment profit increase, it would appear as if margins are going to be down almost a couple of hundred basis points in the second half versus the first half. It looks like most of the increase in the outlook was attributable to the pick up. So maybe Marillyn, you might be able to address some of the productivity incentives underway that, you know, have enabled you first to do as well as you have in the first half and then maybe also address why it wouldn\u2019t stay at the same rate, other than that one large contract adjustment. ","Bruce Tanner","Howard, let me try to address. You asked a pretty specific question there on segment operating margins in the second half and what\u2019s expected to happen. So we did have a couple of things happen the first half of the year, including as you saw within our MST business, a couple of contractual resolutions. They were a good size. I mean obviously if you look at the margins for that business, in particular, that\u2019s a record level of margins and it was obviously, maybe not obviously, but it was driven by those contractual resolutions. Those are not expected to replicate in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s one item that will bring it down first half relative to second half. ","Secondly, space systems also up a little bit first half of the year. Think of that as some of the phasing and the mix of where we're seeing some of the URLA equity earnings and expect to see a little bit of a reduction in that in the second half of the year. You know so that\u2019s, I think you did the math exactly right in the guidance we have, Howard. You know the wild card in all this is we have a certain level of planned, I\u2019ll say, risked retirements that we expect to occur in both third quarter and fourth quarter. And just as we had some benefits beyond what we were planning in the first and second quarter, if those occur as they did in the first and second, that may be able to mitigate some of that reduction you see or you're talking about. If they don\u2019t, then we won't see that happen. It\u2019s kind of that simple. Now I\u2019ll put the call back over to Marillyn for I think the second half of your question. ","Marillyn Hewson","Your question about, you know, what do we see in terms of continued cost reductions, I would just, you know, point to the fact that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve been very corrective as I said earlier, the last several years, I\u2019m just getting ahead of the budget cuts by reducing expenses and headcount. But we have very few leaders that don\u2019t just manage programs, they manage their business on an ongoing basis. And they have very strong cost control discipline in their business. So we look at that and monitor that on an ongoing basis. As I said earlier, we tried to keep our structure in line with the business base we have.","The other thing that is driving the performance of the businesses is just consistent performance on the programs. We don\u2019t -- we're performing well across all of the business areas with very deliberate management of the programs in making sure that we perform and meet the cost targets that those contracts drive and continue to look at ways that we can improve our margins on the programs.","It\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s a good -- straighter good performance by our leadership and our team across the business in executing on programs that they have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","I wanted to ask something, Bruce, just your discussion about the options just triggered something which is just in terms of the incentive compensation and thinking about things on going forward basis. I know that TSR is an important metric. But if a lot of people start cashing out of options, do you need to do something to continue to incent people on a go-forward basis. This is kind of part one.","And part two, the higher stock price itself. What is that going to do for the remainder of the year in terms of the Rabbi Trusts or any other sorts of, I guess, compensation programs and the shares outstanding as a result?","Bruce Tanner","So Sam, I\u2019ll address the first part. So if you have read the proxy, what you\u2019ve seen happen in the past two years, we\u2019ve actually been lowering the number of options that are paid not just to the senior leadership team but to leaders -- leadership in general. And in fact, at the start of this year, we eliminated option as a component of our executive compensation program. So all of our equity compensation going forward is either in the form of RSUs or performance stock units.","And so one of the things that I don\u2019t think we necessarily had a complete understanding amongst all of our investors is that some of the dilutive aspects that have been occurring -- that have been meeting to be offset through share repurchases had been because of the level of option exercises. So if you track the number of outstanding options over the past few years, that\u2019s come down fairly significantly.","And I guess, it\u2019s kind of a good news, bad news each. As the stock price increases, we have more option exercise which increases the dilution effect but it also gets rid of those options at a faster cliff such that going forward. I don\u2019t have this on top of my head but I want to say on an annual basis, we were currently providing somewhere in the 5-ish -- maybe 6 million shares or so of options on an annual basis, maybe more like 7 million shares.","And if you\u2019re just providing the same amount of executive compensation, it takes a lot fewer shares to do that with RSUs and performance stock units. So on an annual run rate, we\u2019re going to see less dilutive opportunities, if you will, from our executive compensation program than we\u2019ve had in years passed. So that\u2019s a direct reflection of some of the conversations we\u2019ve had with investors who raised that point to us and we made that change accordingly.","I think your second question was the higher stock prices -- higher stock price in the second half of the year and its impact on the Rabbi Trust. And really there is not an associated impact there as I think of it, but certainly Rabbi Trust, you can put it in essentially the same sorts of options that 401-k opportunities are for employees. And we try to match that from our liabilities perspective. So I think it\u2019s more targeted to overall market performance, if you will, then directly to the Lockheed Martin stock.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Following on aeronautics, if you look forward and you had about 12% margin levels recently. When you look forward, you are going through a fairly significant mix change with F-35 growing its share of revenues but at the same time, you\u2019ve got more and more sustainment coming from F-22, F-16, C-130J, how do you see those two things playing out going forward and should we see aeronautics margins tend to stay at the kind of levels they\u2019re at today?","Bruce Tanner","","Yeah. So I\u2019ll try that one. We\u2019ve said for quite some time, I always sort of describe this as the algebra of this business when it comes to aeronautics margins. Going forward, even though the overall F-35 margins are expected to increase going forward, we have a bit of mitigation impact there because we just lowered, if you will, the go forward booking rate, if you want to think about it that way from SSD contract by virtue of what we did with the adjustment we took this quarter.","So if you kind of throw all those things into the mix, what I would expect to see is that the margins of aeronautics will come down a little bit in the future as we\u2019ve predicted probably for the last two or three years, simply because of the higher F-35 volume. Even while the F-35 on a standalone basis is kind of increasing year-over-year, it still has a dilutive effect on the overall margins aeronautics because some of -- the volume that it is offsetting was higher margin C-130 and F-16 were.","Just to give you a little bit of perspective -- I think I\u2019ve been fairly consistent saying, we like to see the F-35 production contract sort of get into a double-digit margin level by the time we get to the 4A production. If we just strip out the SDD performance from the overall F-35 program of this form on the production contract, we should think of this as we\u2019re kind of in the higher, single digit levels today. So that program in generally is kind of performing in line with our expectations.","SDD clearly has -- we don\u2019t like to have back to back adjustments like we had in the second quarter of last year in the second quarter of this year. So that has been performing from a margin perspective as well as we\u2019d like it to. And that has a bit of a drag as I said. But I think the production part; they\u2019re actually performing pretty well. But that still is what\u2019s causing again, what I call sort of the algebra effect on aeronautics margins.","Jerry F. Kircher","","I\u2019m sorry. I think you\u2019re coming up on, yeah maybe one last call? Someone has questions?","Bruce Tanner","","All right.","","Operator","And our final question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Hi, good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","","Good morning.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Two quick ones probably for you Bruce; following up on that F-35; in the quarter you had commented you had a $50 million increase in profit and revenues were up $175 million. So could you break out how much of that was inception to date pickups versus just maybe, say the margin improvement itself? And then in the space area, you had a $50 million increase in the ULA profit which struck me as a big number. Did you just kind of just go through what caused that and is there any way to forecast what that might be going forward? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. George, I\u2019ll try to address both of those. So you\u2019re right. I think the press release identifies the amount that you talked about in terms of the $50 million and the $175 million. Maybe the simplest way to think of that George, is sort of go into the mid-single -- the upper single digit levels on the sales volume and take everything else as soon as that sort of the step up in the quarter. I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a pretty good chunk of that overall $50 million on that $175 million sales increase. But I don\u2019t have it sort of exactly in my head.","The $50 million ULA is the (inaudible) one of the reasons and one of things I talked about earlier in terms of a lot of reasons why the margins in space systems are higher. That\u2019s a couple of things again. We mentioned the mix aspects within ULA; ULA margins are -- the mix result are better this year than last year in terms of profitability in terms of launches and the volume will be up as well. So we would expect to see for the rest of the year, not probably quite a comparable level as the first half. They\u2019re pretty close to that level in the second half.","I think the thing that\u2019s stuck out and the reason it stopped so much the second quarter of this year is because actually last year due to some of officer issues, the mix issues and the phase within the year, last year's second quarter was by far the lowest quarter of the year for ULA from an equity earning's perspective. So that made this quarter, although it is higher than to move, it has been historically, it made the difference between second quarter last year and second quarter this year appears even greater.","Marillyn Hewson","So let me wrap up our call today by again highlighting that I believe our second quarter results and increased guidance illustrate the solid position and performance of the corporation to provide value to our shareholders and solutions to our customers. Even in an uncertain budget environment, our product portfolio, strong balance sheet, robust cash generation and the exceptional execution by our 116,000 employees will continue to propel our corporation forward. So, thank you again for your interest and for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in October.

Welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry F. Kircher","Thank you, Karen, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Stevens","Thanks, Jerry. Thanks, everyone, for being with us today. We'll proceed on the assumption that you had an opportunity to review our releases this morning.","Since we last spoke in April, we've undertaken a fair amount of international travel to talk directly with our customers and government leaders, consistent with our strategy to increase our international work while we rebalance national security spending here in the United States. While all governments are clearly watching the global economic environment, all are keenly aware of growing security challenges.","As we assess our portfolio, we believe we possess the systems, the capabilities, the skills and the resources to support our security cooperation partners around the globe. And I was very gratified to see strong broad-based operational performance in the second quarter throughout the company based on solid execution and discipline focus. We believe our portfolio gives us opportunities to continue to expand international sales.","Relative to the government fiscal year '13 defense budget, the House has marked and committee both the Defense Authorization Bill and all 12 appropriation bills, including defense. And the Senate has marked the Defense Authorization Bill and committee and will likely mark the Defense Appropriation Bill by the end of this month. At this point, however, we do not expect the bills to be in place at the beginning of the government's fiscal year on October 1, but rather have a continuing resolution that will commence on 1 October and likely extend through the end of the calendar year, enabling the Congress to convene a lame duck session after the election where we believe a broader number of very important initiatives like the debt limit extension, entitlement reform tax policy and spending levels together, sometimes referred to as the fiscal cliff issues, will be addressed.","Sequestration continues to be a great concern to us. There is at present very little insight or detailed understanding as to how sequestration will be implemented even though this law requiring an additional $55 billion reduction in both defense and in non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect January 2, 94 days into the government fiscal year. Without sufficient planning information, we have been unable to more precisely estimate the adverse impacts, and have petitioned the administration and the Congress to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive process, or if sequestration is to occur, provide the necessary planning information so we can properly and responsibly prepare to act.","I'll be happy to cover these or any other topics in more detail during our discussion but first, let's turn to Chris for the operational report and Bruce for the financials. Chris?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Well, thanks, Bob. From an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter in an uncertain and challenging environment. In the area of new business, we had several multiyear awards that allow us to offer innovative, relevant and affordable solutions to our customers.","In Electronic Systems, the U.S. Navy awarded a 5-year, $1 billion contract to provide more than 200 digital cockpits and integrated systems and sensors for the new MH-60 Romeo and CR helicopters. The Navy will realize significant savings due to the multiyear contracting vehicle.","In Information Systems & Global Solutions, our team continues to build upon their impressive string of competitive wins over the last 6 months. We were previously awarded the National Science Foundation NRT contract and the DoD Cyber Crime Center contract. This quarter, we won the Defense Information System Agency contract to manage the transformation of the DoD's global data network. IS&GS also achieved another milestone with its recognition as the top IT service provider to the federal government for the 18th consecutive year.","Let me just now turn to some of our key operational achievements in the quarter. Electronic Systems delivered the second Littoral Combat Ship to Fort Worth. Our team successfully completed acceptance trials and delivered the ship to the U.S. Navy in June, 2 months ahead of schedule and under cost.","Our LCS team achieved another important milestone when the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey completed their review of our first ship, the USS Freedom, and declared the ship fit for duty. I just returned from Singapore, and there was much excitement and anticipation for the USS Freedom arriving next year where it will perform a key role in our new U.S. Defense strategy.","Electronic Systems also continued to expand critical capabilities in the growing area of Missile Defense with intercepted targets by 2 of our systems. Our Aegis ballistic Missile Defense system successfully intercepted a target missile using the upgraded Aegis system for the first time. Additionally, our PAC-3 missile successfully intercepted and destroyed a cruise missile target, demonstrating the unique ability of the system to detect, track and destroy at extended range.","Missile defense is a growing market internationally, and we are well positioned with our broad portfolio of Aegis, Patriot, MEADS and THAAD, along with the related command and control and battle management systems.","In our Space Systems business, the second advanced VHF military communications satellites for the U.S. Air Force has launched, and we delivered 2 commercial Satellites in the quarter.","Let me wrap up with the F-35 status. Overall, the program continues to gain momentum in developmental flight testing, production activities and international interest. Flight test on the development program are progressing at a solid pace. Year-to-date through June, test flights are significantly ahead of plan by 150 flights or 34%, and test points are also ahead of plan by over 900 points or 24%.","Software development is another area of progress on the program. As we've mentioned on previous calls, software development is a critically important element of the F-35 program. We discussed some scheduled pressures during our last call, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing improvements to the schedule. As a further sell-in to software maturity and deployment, we began flying the Block 2 A software on the first STOVL aircraft in June. This Block is now flying on CTOL and STOVL aircraft.","Production activities are continuing to progress. In our second quarter, we delivered 3 production aircraft. Since then, we've delivered 7 additional aircraft, bringing year-to-date production deliveries to 12. Included in this total is the first international aircraft delivered to the United Kingdom.","In the area of new production contracts, we were pleased with the award of $490 million for long lead on LRIP 7 this quarter. This authorization enables procurement activities to begin for 35 aircraft and add stability to the supplier base and production line.","Internationally, the F-35 program continued to receive strong support. This quarter, Norway announced their initial order for 2 aircraft, which is expected to be followed by up to 50 additional aircraft. After the close of the quarter, Japan reaffirmed their intentions to purchase the F-35 and signed a letter of offer and acceptance to order 4 initial aircraft.","Additionally, international new business opportunities continue to emerge on the F-35. This past quarter, we submitted a proposal to supply 60 aircraft to South Korea. The announcement of the winning aircraft is scheduled to occur before the end of the year. Overall, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity and tempo, and the global F-35 team looks forward to providing this critical asset to our nation and allies.","With current aircraft deployment of 19 operational aircraft to Eglin Air Force Base, including the U.K. aircraft, plus 8 test aircraft at Patuxent Naval Air Station, 6 more test aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base and just over 70 aircraft in production flow, the F-35 program is making good progress.","With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce to discuss our financials.","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with Chart 3 in an overview of the second quarter. We grew sales for the company by 3% versus the second quarter of 2011. I'll describe the drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit margins improved by 60 basis points to 12.3%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of charts. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 10%, driven by the higher sales volume and margin improvement.","We generated $845 million in cash from operations while contributing more than $600 million into our pension plans. This amount completes the $1.1 billion in required contributions for the year. And as you saw in our earnings release, we've increased our outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.","On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. As in the first quarter, sales were slightly ahead of our expectations with 3 of our 4 business areas growing. Aeronautics grew 1% in the quarter led by additional quantities of F-16 deliveries. This growth was dampened by the labor strike in Fort Worth, particularly on the F-35 program. Electronic Systems had 2% growth in the quarter, driven by our Mission Systems & Sensors business unit, which had higher volume for our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS along with higher activity on our LCS and MH-60 programs.","Space Systems had significant growth in the quarter driven by the delivery of 2 commercial Satellites versus none in the second quarter last year. We also had higher volume on the Orion program compared with last year. And finally, IS&GS declined by 4% driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS program. As with the first quarter, IS&GS's sales reduction was less than we had expected, with continuing growth in our Intelligence line of business, particularly in federal cyber activity helping to lessen the decline.","Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the 4 business areas. The primary reason for the overall margin increase to 12.3% was due to improvements in our Aeronautics and Electronic Systems business areas. I'd like to discuss these in a little more detail.","Within Aeronautics, there were several factors that resulted in a 13.3% margin in the quarter that warrants additional discussion. First, we reduced our profit booking rate for the F-35 SDD contract from just over 4% to just under 4%, which yielded an inception-to-date $85 million reduction in profit in the quarter. While we had previously assumed a deck-oriented amount for the remaining fee would be earned, this adjustment reduces that amount even more. We made this adjustment as there's currently no plan in place for the government for how over $500 million of remaining fee can be earned, and we are nearing the point where the amount of profit recorded would exceed the amount of fees received to date on the contract.","In addition, we've been disappointed recently with the amount of fee available to be earned for developmental milestones and the government's evaluations of our performance against those milestones compared with our own assessment. Importantly, because of where we are from percent complete basis on the development contract, the vast majority of the profit adjustment affects the current year. The lower rate has little incremental impact on future margins and earnings for Aeronautics.","This SDD adjustment was substantially offset by contractual resolutions on other firms such as the F-22, leaving outstanding performance on our C-130 program, particularly on international contracts, as the principal reason for the improved margin performance in the quarter. And as Chris mentioned, we're pleased with our progress on the F-35 program as a whole.","Looking at the margin for Electronic Systems, the story is similar to Aeronautics. Improved performance on a number of programs drove the higher margin as contractual resolutions offset proper rate reductions on a few programs and severance cost for workforce reductions at MS2.","Within IS&GS, the higher margin results from a slight improvement in our Intelligence line of business across a number of contracts and the reduction in the margin in Space Systems primarily reflects lower equity earnings due to timing in the quarter. Higher earnings associated with risk retirements on the Orion program helped to partially offset the lower equity earnings.","Turning to Chart 6 and earnings per share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations grew 10% over the amount reported last year, and adjusting our reported EPS for the effects of the FAS\/CAS adjustment increases our earnings per share to $2.77 per share.","If you'll turn to Chart 7, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year. Adjusting for the higher pension contributions we made this year compared with last, our pre-pension cash flow was more than $1.4 billion. And after considering the strong performance during the first half of the year and our expectations for the rest of the year, we increased our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than or equal to $3.9 billion for the year.","On Chart 8, we'll discuss our updated guidance. We're maintaining our sales outlook, although we are updating 2 of the business areas within this guidance level as we'll discuss shortly. We increased segment operating profit by $125 million. We also increased our earnings per share, as I'll detail in the next chart and again, we increased our cash from operations by $100 million.","Chart 9 shows our EPS outlook reconciliation. The segment operating profit increase added $0.25 to our outlook. Several items partially offset that increase, making the net increase to our annual EPS $0.20, resulting in a new range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share.","Chart 10 shows our sales outlook where we lowered Aeronautics by $200 million for the year, primarily reflecting the effects of the strike. About half of the reduction is for lower F-35 volume, and the other half is an expected slip of 3 F-16 aircraft out of 2012 into 2013. Offsetting this reduction is a $200 million increase in Space Systems, reflecting their strong performance year-to-date.","Chart 11 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Again, the total increase is $125 million with Aeronautics and Electronic Systems both increasing $50 million for the year, whilst Space Systems increased $25 million.","And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 12. We've had an excellent first half of the year, which reflects the strength of our portfolio and the affordability actions we've taken. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales will be about $1 billion lower than 2011 results, primarily due to decreases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. We expect segment operating margins to be comparable to last year's and cash from operations to exceed $1 billion.","With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bob, actually, a tactical near-term question and a second strategic question for you, if you don't mind. The Antideficiency Act precludes the government from spending more than Congress authorizes and many contracts are incrementally funded, which means 1 should start affecting 3 and 4Q results. To what extent does the 2012 guidance reflect this, and can you help us understand your key assumptions? Will you pay employees out of profits and assume retroactive authorization or does your guidance presume stoppage of many of your large contracts? And can you touch on which large contracts are most at risk under warrant?","Robert J. Stevens","That's a comprehensive question, Heidi. I think the details of your question highlight many of the specific details that have gone into our requests for additional guidance because there is considerable uncertainty in understanding exactly how sequestration would be implemented and how, for example, unobligated balances might be affected, how those unobligated balances might be applied contract line item by contract line item. Whether or not military personnel accounts will be excluded or included in the total amount to be sequestered because that has a fairly significant impact on the percentage reductions. So I think your question's front-running a little bit of the detail we have. I'm sure that our government customers are thinking about their responsibilities under the Antideficiency provisions, I think they understand that pretty well. And I think the final part of your question was which contracts, particularly the significant ones, might be most affected. And here again, I think the devil lies a little bit in the details of understanding exactly how the across-the-board reductions, perhaps net of funds flowing from unobligated balances versus new obligational authority subject to sequestration will impact our individual contracts. So, of course, we have significant portfolio areas. Chris mentioned Missile Defense, Chris mentioned the tactical aircraft portfolio, our airlift capability, our Space Systems programs. We think some of our classified activity likely will all be subject to sequester, and which programs will absorb what percent of the cost reduction is not yet clear to us.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Heidi, I'll jump in on one comment. As Bob said in his opening remarks, we have contemplated or we are contemplating a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter of this year, and I'll say that affects our business areas differently depending on sort of where they are in the life cycle. The one is -- the most impacted is IS&GS typically because it's the shorter cycle business that we have. So I would say we're probably a little cautious perhaps in the guidance that we're giving, considering the fact that we do believe that continuing resolution is likely going to happen in that fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bruce, I was just wondering if we could talk a little bit about cash and maybe start off with some comments around FAS\/CAS and harmonization of that system. I know that starting back in February, you were able to begin raising your rates and including FAS\/CAS harmonization going forward. I'm just wondering how that process is going and whether the outlook that you've talked about in the past and the impact that FAS\/CAS will have on you going forward, what that kind of looks like. And then just on the cash topic, the use this quarter on the share repurchase somewhat has you pacing below the $1 billion that you've talked about targeting for repurchases. Can you just give us an update on that as well?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes, sure, Jason. So as far as sort of a current status of how FAS\/CAS is going and is it tracking to what we talked about in the past, I would say yes, it is. That law, I think, was signed February 27 of this year. We've already negotiated across the corporation, a number of what we call our forward pricing right agreements that have the effects of CAS harmonization included in them. So I'll say that is sort of a business as usual at this point right now. You've seen -- as we've all seen the effects of lower interest rate through the first half of this year, they're definitely lower probably than where we were at the end of last year. Of course, we don't set those rates until the end of this year, but if we were to set them today, they'd be lower than where we were last year. Our asset returns, I think, are doing actually fairly comparable to what our expectations were. The one thing I think that's changed, Jason, that's important to consider not necessarily this year but in future years is the transportation -- or excuse me, the highway bill that was passed recently, which had a consideration for reducing some of the funding required by ERISA. And that has the effect of lowering the requirements for our ERISA contributions beginning next year. The modeling of that's a little complicated. I won't get into it, but basically think of a band of around the sort of a 25-year average of interest rates. And if you're outside that, if your current interest rate or discount rate is outside of that band and you used the 25-year average, we're definitely outside of that band as we go into 2013, and so we'll use that 25-year average, which is a much higher rate than what we're currently experiencing. That has the effect of -- I think I tried to tee up on the call in the first quarter that we've had ERISA required contributions of more than $2 billion going into next year compared to $1.1 billion this year. That change in the funding consideration change including the highway transportation bill would lower the required contribution to about the level comparable to what we're seeing this year. So somewhere in the 1.1-ish range or maybe a little flexibility there because we haven't quite seen the final rates come out of that yet, so there may be a little bit of play but not much, I would guess. And so this is as we get bigger hits sort of from negative events due to the size of our pension plan, we also get bigger benefits when there are positive events as well. I'll remind you also that the pension, reduced pension brings with it a reduced tax deduction as well. So you shouldn't think of the $1 billion as being a pure cash because there will be less tax deduction associated with that $1 billion less. You also asked about share repurchases, and we are a little bit light to the first half of the year. We've made no change in our commitment to the $1 billion outlook, and I won't expect to make a change between now and at the year end then.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bob, you seem to have taken a sort of leadership role for the industry in your comments that you've made publicly about sequestration. I'm wondering what sorts of conversations you've been having with Congress about potential possible outcomes and time lines? And I'm wondering if you can sense any sort of incremental change in language or posture recently that you -- that's detectable or have we made no progress over the last quarter?","Robert J. Stevens","Well, thanks for the question, Carter. I know that many in the industry are experiencing exactly what we are right now, Carter, and that, I think, is best characterized by a huge amount of uncertainty for a long-cycle business like ours to be unable to see 6 months into the future for a pretty dramatic reduction of resources available to our customers, a significant and for us unprecedented. Throughout industry, I think that reaction is similar. I will say the awareness about the more detailed aspects of sequestration, I believe, is growing and has grown. And it's important to remember the sequestration is not just a reduction in discretionary defense accounts. It's also a reduction in non-defense discretionary accounts, which affect lots of civil government agencies. So I believe we're hearing more detailed descriptions from agency heads and leaders in the government about the potential adverse impacts in their ability to meet their mission responsibilities or fulfill their commitments under sequestration. For our part, we are trying to model internally but to be very candid with you, that model is filled much more with our assumptions about what might happen than any detail specifically given to us about what will happen. The facts are sequestration is the law. It goes into effect January 2. It requires $55 billion in each of defense and nondiscretionary -- nondefense discretionary accounts. Beyond that, we're still struggling with exactly how this will impact our business. We are very concerned about the supply chain, particularly small disadvantaged minority-owned businesses. That's what we regard as the edge of that supply chain. I know we're having discussions here about what kind of business we'll have if we are compelled to implement sequestration. I think they're asking if they'll even have a business, will they have an enterprise. So I think there are significant shocks to the industrial base and very honestly, we simply try to describe them to our best professional capacity, not to incite any particular level of over concern, but we are very, very concerned about the across-the-board nature with an automatic trigger, and that's what we've tried to voice.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a question on book to bill. So it was about 0.9x, a bit less than the 1x, but still an improvement versus first quarter. I just want to gauge the confidence in finishing the year with book to bill of about 1x, maybe highlight some of the contracts you're expecting to book in the second half. Now also, did I hear say that you thought South Korea would be booked by year end, and is that one of the things that's giving you the confidence?","Bruce L. Tanner","Rich, it's Bruce, I'll take that one. Your assessment of where we are in the second quarter relative to orders is correct. And I'll say probably what's not as apparent in just the absolute numbers reported is we are actually ahead of where we thought we'd be at the second quarter this time. I tried to tee up on the first call that we thought the second quarter would be down a little lower than normal. The results might lead you to believe that that's the case, but that's actually a little better than we expected it to be. We also mentioned that we thought the third quarter would be a higher rebound than we historically have in years past, and we still think that'll be the case. You asked about some of the -- what are the contracts we're looking for. Most of them, frankly, are in the category of what I'll call follow-on contracts or contracts to be left with the new fiscal year. So yes, the ones I'm watching to close between now in the second and the end of this year are the F-35, our 5 contract, getting additional funding in the form of undefinitized contractual action or other means on the LRIP 6 contract. We'd like to close the THAAD, the combined buy of THAAD missiles from the U.S. government as well as the UAE. And we've got a whole slew of new fiscal year contracts that usually pop up in the fourth quarter. Think of that as the fleet ballistic missile and the PAC-3 contracts that'll play there. I think, was there a second part of the question there?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Rich, this is Chris. I mentioned South Korea is a competition for the F-35. We were told the down select would be at the end of the year, but the actual contract would be in the latter part of 2013 at the earliest. So that would not be in our orders of backlog in 2012.","Bruce L. Tanner","And, Rich, I don't think I answered kind of the last part of your question, which was what's the confidence level we have for sort of ending the year at a 1.0. I still think as we sit here today, even with all the caveats that we did relative to sequestration and so forth, we've got a fairly good chance of achieving the same level of backlog at the end of this year as we started the beginning of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to dive a little bit into the -- some of the details on the F-35 contract profit accrual rates. And so, Bruce, you gave a good description of what's going on with SDD. I just want to confirm that essentially, what you're assuming now is that your future fees will be about 4% of future revenues because you're pretty much at a crossover point right now where that's sure looking backward. And then more importantly, over on the LRIP side, which contracts drove the $20 million risk retirement? And where do we stand on specifically on LRIP 5?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Joe, for the question. I think you had assessed pretty right. The changes that we talked about, I think it's important to note and obviously you understand that very clearly. This is only affecting the development contract. The production firms aren't impacted by that. The production programs typically don't have much, if any, award fee. They're typically kind of cost performance driven, and so that's also different than the rate or the change that we've talked about for the F-35 SDD contract. I made a comment that we were booking higher than 4%, to a little bit higher than 4% going into this quarter. We came out a little lower than 4%, and that's the adjustment that does bring our booked profit down, if you will, below the amount of earned fee that we have at this point in time. The 2 programs on the production side where we had some performance improvements or booking rate increases this quarter were both Lot 3 and Lot 5. And I think as we progress throughout the year, I think I made the comment either last quarter or the quarter before about the number of deliveries, and Chris highlighted that as well in his prepared remarks, and we're going to finalize deliveries of all the LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 and a pretty good portion of LRIP 4 aircraft this year. So typically, as with most production programs, that will give you that the -- give us, excuse me, the opportunity to assess our performance on that and see if it's coming in line with our expectations and enables additional risk retirements. I think there was one other part of your question there, Joe. I've lost track of what it is, to be honest with you, so I'll go on to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to get your thoughts on cost reduction. It's something that you've emphasized quite a bit over the last 6 to 9 months. Can you talk about what you're doing in that area, whether it's overhead reduction, supply chain facilities? And are there certain targets you have and certain progress against those? In other words, is there any way to quantify the kinds of actions you're taking?","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on the affordability for the last several years, and it really is all encompassing. Let me start with the employees and the leadership team. If you go back a little over 1 year ago, we had our Voluntary Executive Separation Program where 26% of the leadership team was reduced, and that was over 600 people. Of course, there's the flow down impact of that. We're looking at the layers, we're looking at the span of control as it relates to the personnel and the organizational structure. And we're continuing to look at how best to organize. And you'll recall a couple of years ago, we exited the Eagan, Minnesota facility, we consolidated Owego onto MS2, all those things are on the table. We've focused quite a bit on facilities and our actual footprint. We've taken out over 1.5 million square feet of our facilities, both owned and leased. We have another 2.9 million to go that we've identified and obviously, if there were further cuts to the budget, there could be significantly more reductions. And the supply chain you mentioned, clearly that's an area that we focused both internally with category management as we call it, consolidating our suppliers and holding them accountable for the quality and timely delivery. So I see some of these as being shorter term, some midterm and then, of course, we're always looking out on the long term. And you know back in '06, we placed our defined benefit pension plan with defined contribution pension plan. And that will, I think, position us well for the long term. So that's just kind of an overview of what we're doing. I think when I last looked, you can easily calculate several billion dollars of reduction that we benefited from and that we passed on to our customers as a result of these actions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Question, I guess either Bob or Chris, really want to focus on Information Systems and -- or IS&GS. Just regarding we've seen the most erosion there in terms of the backlog, and I get it regarding being impacted by the CR. But I guess following up on Doug's question in terms of your ability to reduce costs and preserve margins there, you've done a nice job at net 9%, but we're still seeing that's the only segment that's not growing. Can you give us a little more color on that? We're hearing about a lot of predatory practices amongst your peers in terms of bidding contracts pretty aggressively about preserving those margins.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Yes, Peter, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. I guess we were very satisfied with our margins in IS&GS this quarter, and we seem to have been able to maintain at or around 9%. Relative to top line growth, you're right. We are experiencing some decline there. It's not unexpected for the reasons that Bob and Bruce mentioned and you suggested in your question. We will continue to bid what we think are appropriate business cases for our business. And I must say we've been very successful on winning some significant opportunities of late. And the protesting is continuing, probably more so than the predatory bidding practices. So I think we have 3 major wins currently under review that we had previously win. So our strategy is to win all the business we can at the appropriate returns. We'll let the 100-day protest cycle run out, and then we will move forward. So I have very high confidence in our ability to execute on these programs. We're hitting all of our milestones. But as I look forward to additional growth opportunity, we're really focused on Cyber Security, and I mentioned that we won the -- what was referred to as the DC3 contract. That was the largest Department of Defense cyber contract awarded to date. We have numerous engagements with Fortune 100 corporations, and we're also continuing to look in health care, IT and the energy lines of business as additional growth areas. So I think we have a good strategy. We're executing on it, and I'm optimistic that we'll find a way to grow over the long haul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess this is probably a question for Bruce. You obviously benefited from a significant amount of positive contract adjustments in the quarter. Could you talk about what the guidance for the year assumes for positive adjustments, and which business areas have the biggest opportunity for positive adjustments moving forward?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, David. I think I said at the start, I lose track which quarter I made these comments on, but I think I said in the first quarter that we were looking at 2012 to have maybe comparable levels of performance improvements as what we saw in 2011. And we actually saw a pretty big increase in those performance improvements mostly coming in Electronic Systems in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we had some good performance, both particularly in Aeronautics and Electronic Systems, also Space Systems on the Orion program, as well as the contractual resolutions that we mentioned that also caused us to come in higher than what we've started at the beginning of the year or expected at the beginning of the year. Our expectations for the second half of the year are probably to be down a little bit compared to the second half of 2011. But again, as we get into the quarter and we actually do our assessments of where we stand on program performance, that's when we would have unexpected both performance improvements, as well as potential reductions in profits rates. But from a planning perspective, as we sit here today, we expect it to be a little lighter in the second half of the year compared to 2011 and by definition, lighter in the second half this year compared to the first half of this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bruce, just a quick follow-up on the pension. I think previously, you said you expected the FAS\/CAS charge next year to be roughly half what you're booking this year. Has that situation changed given the moving metrics of contributions, interest rates and the new legislation on ERISA contributions?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes. We're probably about 6 months before I'd like to have this conversation, Rob, but definitely, as I said earlier, interest rates are down. If I was to put a number on it, they're probably down about 75 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Your guess is probably better than mine at this point as to what they will have or what they will do between now and the end of the year. You're right on the quantification I've given in the past, all that assumes, as I'd like to call it sort of current course and speed with the same level of discount rate as we ended last year and an 8% return on assets. Again, as I mentioned in the earlier remarks, I think our asset returns are actually holding pretty steady to that level. But the discount rate, if we were to pick it today, would be lower than what it was the end of the year. That would have the tendency to increase FAS, which would make a smaller drop. I still believe it would be a drop at this point from the FAS\/CAS adjustment from 2012 to '13. There'd be a lesser drop.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Bruce, if I take a look at the guidance you have for the second half of the year, you're assuming maybe flattish revenues with the first half and a 10.9% or so margin. I guess that's consistent with David's question about what's embedded in the second half of the year for ECAs. But my question is if you go back to last year and your prior years, it's highly unusual for the second half to have a much lower margin than the first half and yes, that's what's being projected. So is there something else that's in there besides the comment about assuming no incremental ECAs?","Bruce L. Tanner","George, let me try to address a couple of things I think embedded in your question. One is just the second half versus the first half in general, and then I'll hit on the margins especially. Yes, I've taken a look at where we sit today and what our expectations are relative to the guidance we provided for the second half versus where we sit today. There's a couple of things that happened in the first half of the year that won't repeat from a revenue side in the second half of the year. The first of those is again, we had 2 commercial Satellites in the first half of the year, and we're expecting no commercial Satellites in the second half. Think of that as probably a little less than $300 million or so that won't be repeated. Within Electronic Systems, all 29 of the Persistent Threat Detection Systems or PTDS systems that were under contract actually delivered in the first half. So that contract is essentially finished, there will be no PTDS deliveries in the second half. Think of that also as in the $300 million range. So there's sort of $600 million of pressure going from the first half to the second half of the year. We also have in the second half, probably 9 to 10 fewer F-16 deliveries, second half of the year again versus first half. But that's probably offset in large part, maybe even more so, because we expect to have 4 to 5 more C-5 deliveries in the second half than the one we've had in the first half. So those kind of pushed probably. I think as I look at say, the year, it's easier to understand if you sort of do a sequential quarter-to-quarter, it's easier to understand that. So we did roughly $23 billion of revenue in the first half. And I think if you just went to the midpoint in the guidance, it's 45 5. So you can say if you just double the 23, we're pretty close to the 45 5, but for those 2 items I mentioned previously. I think the issue is that the comparison with the second half for 2011 is a tough comparison. Both the third and fourth quarter of last year were much higher than the first and second quarter of last year. And just for example, we did $22 billion roughly in the sales in the first half. We did $24.5 billion roughly in the second half. So obviously, we tremendously outperformed the second half relative to the first half whereas 2012, as I said before, is going to be a little lighter in the second half. I also said we might be a little bit conservative as we sit here today with the expected continuing resolution in the fourth quarter and the prospects of a sequestration on January 2, but we'll see if that actually changes and we'll update accordingly. Relative to the margins, George, you said we don't have a tendency to have a lower second half than the first half, and I'll tell you that's -- we'll still try to make that come true. But we've had, again, just taking a look at the increased profit rate adjustments, as well as the contractual resolutions that we had happen in the first half of the year, our expectations as we sit here today is that those won't replicate at the same level for the same reason I told David in the second half. And that's what will drive margins. Again, maybe a little bit conservative on the top side, it would drive some EBIT, but I don't know if the margins will change all that much from the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit just about something around the cash flow, which was around the continuing resolution last year? You certainly moved to build cash levels and seeing the buyback activity weakened, I guess the first piece is are you doing that now? And second piece is does that have any implications for how we should be thinking about the dividend decision that the board typically takes in September where the last few years, we've certainly seen an acceleration from 10% growth to 20% to 30%? How should we be thinking about the appetite for an increase this year going into potentially sequestration and continuing resolution?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Sam, this is Bruce. I'll try that, and Chris or Bob can pile on if they want to. I think as far as cash balances are concerned, we probably are going into the second half of the year with a little higher cash balance than we might otherwise have expected. And I think we're trying to be mindful of what could happen under both the continuing resolution, as well as the potential CR. And again, our position is we don't want to induce behaviors that would cause program performance issues, cost growth, if we can avoid those perhaps with some balance sheet help. And so we're mindful of that. And again, I think we want to have the flexibility in order to accommodate that. We don't see, as I said earlier, I don't see us backing off the $1 billion share repurchase. That's still our plan and goal for the year. Even though we were a little bit lighter in the second quarter, I still think we're going to achieve that $1 billion number. You asked about the dividends in September. We revisit that every year with our Board of Directors. We've had some preliminary conversations with them, but that's a decision that we'll make in consultation with our board members, and I'd be premature to have that discussion with you right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bruce, on ES, you talked about some of the things that benefited the first half, but that looks like the segment that does retract the most in the second half. Is it -- are you being a little conservative there? And then the other thing I was going to ask is really where I think Joe was going before is just the latest on LRIP 5.","Bruce L. Tanner","I knew I missed that one, I'll catch that one on this one, Rob, and I apologize for Joe. I realized after I went to the next speaker that I missed that one. So ES, second half, again the ES, Electronic Systems is where we have the PTDS. Again, we've got about a $300 million headwind because all those units delivered, as I've said earlier, in the first half. I'd like to think, Rob, that we have a chance to do a little better there. That's yet to play out, and we'll watch that closely. I'll say I've been pleasantly surprised by the performance of Electronic Systems in both the first quarter and the second quarter. Electronic Systems historically and going into the future years always has had our highest international content. I think that there's some still substantial international awards this year that could help us with the sales growth in the second half of the year. But those, as usual, are a little harder to predict at this point in time. So are we conservative? I hope so, Rob, and we'll see as that plays out in the second half of the year. LRIP 5 negotiations, again, I apologize, Joe. We're continuing the process. It is a long process. We've been at it now for at least 1.5 years. So I'll say I think we're making slow and steady progress. I think both sides have a desire to get this closed and to get this closed in the not-too-distant future, and we're clearly on that page that we'd like to do as well. I think we will close in a manner that's beneficial to both parties in the not-too-distant future.","Robert J. Stevens","I'll just add on, on the international front and whether these orders get closed this year or 2013. I personally just got back from a 2-week trip in Marilyn Hewson and all our execs have been increasing their international travel to the Far East and the Mid East. And there is definitely a concern relative to threat environment, and I believe our portfolio and the interest they have in our fighter aircraft, whether it's the F-35 or the F-16, the C-130 everybody loves and of course, our Missile Defense and command and control systems, there is a big appetite out there based on the portfolio that we have. And I believe we have the experience and the know-how and the relationships to do business internationally and to grow. And when they hit the books is to be determined, but I can assure you there's a lot of interest and it's a focus of ours going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So, Bruce, could you quantify how big were the cume CAS estimate changes in total in the second quarter, and kind of what are you looking for, for the full year? And then the notional question that you've been at this 30% more or less level for so long, is that sustainable in 2013 and '14 in this current environment?","Bruce L. Tanner","Yes. So, Cai, I think, and I'll stick with what we have in the release, which says we had about $160 million, $170 million in improvement in our profit rate adjustments this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and again, several performance improvements that I elaborated on already across all 4 business areas, but maybe just to reiterate, C-130 international programs, we had, as you might expect because of the end of the PTDS contract, we recognized some performance improvements on that. We also had nice performance on our vertical launch system. On Electronic Systems, we had, as I mentioned earlier, performance improvement because of a risk retirement for a developmental milestone associated with the Orion crew exploration vehicle. And then on top of that, we had, again I'll say an unusually high level of contractual resolutions that resolved this quarter. And so that's the one that is making the numbers probably a little higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. As far as sustainability, you mentioned the 30%. I still think that we're able to maintain that level. If you look back at our history, Cai, we've done that every year. And I look at it again from sort of what is in our planning going forward in terms of planned risk retirements, planned profit rate increases, and I'll say they approach that level today. And where we differ from that level is when we have unplanned beneficial improvements above what we already had considered or when it goes the other way and we have a negative or a decremented proper rate adjustment. Thankfully this year, we've had few of those. Those were offset, again, primarily by the contractual resolutions and were less with the overall performance improvements. So I still see that trend is what was going to happen the latter half of this year and going into 2013 and for that matter, beyond as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You commented in the release that it would take up the contributions into the second half. Bruce, can you talk about what that's going to look like sequentially into the second half? And also, is that a headwind into 2013? And then to squeeze another one in, the pullback in rates, the disconnect now that exists between CAS and ERISA and FAS, do you think mark-to-market approach on pension expense is making more sense given all the changes that have happened over the last 6 months?","Bruce L. Tanner","Thanks, Cai. You got both ends of the spectrum with your question there. I'd like to try to address -- I'm sorry, did I say -- it's Myles, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Myles. Sorry about that. So yes, I didn't try to write some comments in my prepared remarks about the ULA and USA relative to the equity earnings that we're expecting. We had a little over -- equity earnings in the second quarter, as I said, mostly because of timing issues. And it was actually a nice performance improvement out of our ULA operation last quarter that wasn't replicated this quarter, which made that comparison year-over-year a little more difficult. But this quarter had just lower earnings based on the launch vehicles and the like in the second quarter. We do expect a fairly significantly higher second half of the year relative to equity earnings. Most of that coming in the third quarter. You didn't mention USA, but we're also expecting sort of with the closeout of the United Space Alliance activity to have an additional improvement relative to that equity earnings higher than we've experienced in the first half of this year. So both of those are going to cause, I'll say, a little spike in the third quarter and then will come back down in the fourth quarter, but again, collectively higher in the second half than the first half. You asked about going forward, and I'll say we lose that spike relative to the USA going into 2013 and beyond. But what we're seeing within the Space Systems, Cai, and I've said this on a couple of occasions, is we're getting finished with a number of developmental parts of programs such as the MUOS contract, the SBIRS contract and some others. And we're getting into sort of the sweet spot of production vehicles for all those, and we're doing very well on those. And that performance on the production coming out of the development, as you can expect, the margin improvements associated with that are helping to mitigate the downward pressure resulting from the lower equity earnings next year such that I don't expect a large change in the margins to occur because of that lower equity amount. CAS and ERISA and a lot of moving pieces as you described there in mark-to-market, yes, we've looked at that multiple times. And I'm not sure -- this is why I think I keep preaching that you've got to look through the accounting and get to the economics of it. And frankly, I\u2019d personally favor sort of we all got on the same page there, but I don't know that I see a change on the horizon for us to get to mark-to-market as a company.","Jerry F. Kircher","Karen, this is Jerry. I think we'll come up on the hour. Maybe one more question in queue.","Operator","Our final question for today comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sort of related to what you've talked about in Space and then in one other thing. In Space, you made some management reorganizations, if you could address what that does also in terms of taking out cost? And then can you reconcile -- Bob, you alluded to it that you've had some great performance metrics on the F-35 and yet you're not getting, I guess, compensated for it.","Christopher Eugene Kubasik","Okay, Howard, it's Chris. Let me take the Space question. As I mentioned in an earlier answer, we are constantly looking at our organizational structure and looking how best to streamline and consolidate and get synergies both from a revenue and a cost side. What we basically did there was flatten the organization. And I think we went from about 7 or 8 lines of business directly reporting in to our EVP to 4 or 5. The goal there was to reduce the overhead and the infrastructure to support the businesses. And we also appointed a deputy, Rick Ambrose, a longtime executive with the corporation, to help Joanne as we focus on the strategy and the execution. So the overall goal there was better alignment with the customer and cost savings. And I guess I'll turn it over to Bob here for the F-35 and the wrap-up.","Robert J. Stevens","Yes. Thanks, Chris and Howard, thanks for the question. So relative to the F-35 and our earning potential, we all recognize and you all recognize this is a complex demanding program, really a one-of-a-kind type program that's unfolding in an increasingly tough environment. So we're held to very high standards, and we expect to be held to high standards. We look back at the 18 -- last 18 months performance and found it to be good. We're ahead of our planning. I think we're beating our March, there's much more to go. So we're very realistic about the overall performance. Bruce's comments about the system design and development phase, I think, reflect the reality that we're looking at. But increasingly, our earnings potential will be defined by our ability to produce and deliver the production aircraft lot over lot. And we're very focused on achieving that goal because that's what's going to give our customers the forestructure and the capacity that they need and they expect from us. And so all of us are very focused on the entire F-35 program. We've tried to give the best balanced assessment and accounting of how we expect to earn profit. I will tell you we do expect to earn profit. We think when we deliver high-quality products, that is an appropriate economic response, so that we can share in the value of that performance with the investors in the company. So for all of us, we thank you for your time on the call today. We appreciate the questions; thought they were challenging and good and really insightful about our business. I'll tell you we're all very pleased that the company's remained strong and focused in a really challenging environment. We think that's great credit to the women and men who work here. They exhibit great dedication on a daily basis, and we're grateful to them. We have a really strong portfolio. Chris mentioned his international travel along with our other executives, where we believe we're well-aligned with both global and domestic defense and security priorities. Our backlog, our cash resources, the financial strength of our company provide, we think, a degree of certainty in an uncertain environment as we look to deliver increasing value to shareholders and to customers, and we'll stay very focused on high levels of discipline. And as Bruce said, we'll update you as soon as we possibly can as to these changes in our environment and what they might mean to us. So, Karen, thank you for your help on the call today. Thank you, all, for participating and we'll sign off here.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Good morning everyone. I hope you had a good start to the New Year. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call as we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments, and our outlook for 2020.","I will begin by expressing my gratitude to our entire Lockheed Martin team for a remarkable 2019. Over the course of the year, the corporation achieved extraordinary sales growth, earnings performance, strong cash generation, and record backlog and it was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver these results. Ken will discuss our financials in more detail and provide our outlook for 2020, but I'd like to begin by discussing a few of the highlights from 2019 that drove our strong performance.","Notably, for the second year in a row, all four of our business areas grew sales, earnings, and backlog with each contributing to our record cash from operations. Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded last year's fourth quarter by 10% and pushed 2019 growth to 11% over our 2018 results.","Missiles and Fire Control had the highest overall growth in 2019, exceeding the prior year by 20%. Deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, development work on new hypersonic and classified programs, and PAC-3 missile production were the strongest contributors to the increase.","Aeronautics also saw strong sales growth in the quarter and year with 2019 annual sales finishing 12% above 2018, led by our F-35 program which grew 14% in 2019. In space, the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next-gen OPIR contract, the GPS III satellite production program, and recent hypersonic wins continue to provide increased sales volume as the business area exceeded their 2018 topline by 11%.","And Rotary and Mission Systems finished the year 6% over 2018, driven by increases in shipbuilding, radar and logistics programs.","Our segment profit grew nearly $700 million year-over-year, resulting in a segment profit margin of 11% and earnings per share of $21.95, which was another high watermark for the corporation.","This quarter, our backlog increased $6.6 billion and is now approximately $144 billion, reaching a record level for the fifth consecutive year. And we had a strong quarter of cash flows allowing us to use $1 billion to prefund our required 2020 pension contribution and a portion of our 2021 payment and still generate over $7.3 billion of cash from operations for the entire year.","Had we not made this discretionary payment to our pension trust, we would have delivered over $8.3 billion in operating cash, well in excess of our greater than $7.6 billion objective.","2019 was an extraordinary year across the corporation with our team achieving record results in sales, earnings, EPS, cash from operations and backlog. The strength of our portfolio has us well-positioned to continue delivering mission success for our customers and outstanding value to our stockholders.","Before reviewing significant accomplishments from each business area, I will start with an update on the F-35 program, which had an especially successful quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, our F-35 team delivered 51 fighter jets, bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft, exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft, a nearly 50% improvement from last year and a 200% increase from 2016.","Since the program's inception, we have delivered 491 production aircraft with 347 jets being provided to U.S. forces and the balance of 144 planes being delivered to our partner nations and international foreign military sales customers.","Keeping with the F-35, we are pleased that we finalized our agreement for last 12 and 13 this quarter, recognizing orders of approximately $5 billion and adding 112 aircraft to our backlog, bringing our backlog to 374 planes. We anticipate finalizing lot 14 in early 2020.","Our joint industry and government team has established a long-standing objective of offering the F-35A model at a flyaway cost of $80 million in lot 14. And we were able to improve on that target one year ahead of schedule. The lot 14 unit price is now below $78 million, which allows us to offer this remarkable fifth-generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft.","Internationally we were very excited to see Norway declared initial operational capability with its fleet of F-35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft. Since the first F-35 model arrived at \u00d8rland Main Air Station in 2017, the Norwegian Air Force has conducted a rigorous operational testing program in unique winter and northern environmental conditions and has deemed it ready for combat.

Our hypersonics portfolio experienced tremendous growth during 2019 with the total potential value the corporation has received now exceeding $4 billion.","Missiles and Fire Control also booked a $770 million order for PAC-3 missiles to provide additional interceptors and ground support equipment to the U.S. Army and the United Arab Emirates continuing the growth in our air and missile defense line of business.","Moving on to Aeronautics, our air mobility team was awarded their third multiyear contract for the C-130J transport aircraft approving the delivery of 50 new planes over the next few years.","The finalization of this contract added an incremental 35 aircraft and over $2 billion to our backlog in the fourth quarter with the overall value for all 50 planes expected to exceed $3.4 billion.","This award comes as the aero team celebrated the delivery of the 2600 C-130 airlifter since the program began over 60 years ago, with over 450 planes being the current J model. We are proud to be able to continue producing this venerable aircraft for our war fighters and those of the 70 nations currently operating it around the world.","And in space, we were awarded a $3.3 billion 10-year IDIQ contract for the combined orbital operations, logistics and resiliency, or COOLR program, to provide support services on several military communications satellite constellations, including our advanced extremely high-frequency spacecraft.","These satellites provide nuclear-hardened anti-jam global communications to the White House, the State Department and military users, supporting the nation's nuclear command and control system. And we are proud to be able to support the ongoing mission of this critical element of our national security. These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy programs, both domestically and internationally, as well as the impact of our continued investments in forward-looking technologies to drive long-term growth.","Turning briefly to budgets. The fiscal year 2020 Department of Defense Appropriations Act was signed into law last month and finalized defense spending for the current fiscal year. Total defense budgets have been proved for approximately $738 billion, consistent with the levels passed earlier in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 and over $20 billion above FY 2019 enacted amounts.","Our programs garnered strong support across all business areas, with the legislation including nearly $3.5 billion of increased funding beyond the presidential budget request, including $2 billion for 20 additional F-35 fighter jets for a total of 98 aircraft; over $800 million for nine additional C-130J transport aircraft for a total of 20 planes and increased funding for our long-range hypersonic weapon Orion and OPIR contracts, as well as increases for several rotary aircraft programs and other initiatives across the corporation. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to address important security needs for our nation, with the increasing defense budget and these additional appropriations actions, supporting continued growth opportunities into the future.","Moving on, I would like to highlight several key accomplishments from across the corporation, that demonstrate our commitment to developing new technologies, as well as expanding the reach of our heritage solutions. I will start with Missiles and Fire Control, who passed an important milestone on a prospective new business opportunity.","Our tactical missiles team successfully tested its next-generation long-range precision missile for the U.S. Army's precision Strike missile or PrSM competition. The Missiles and Fire Control team launched PrSM from the Lockheed Martin High Mobility Artillery Rocket, or HIMARS system, successfully demonstrating accuracy and range of flight, validating HIMARS' interfaces and testing system software performance. We are excited by the prospects of this enhanced surface-to-surface system and look forward to building on our long-running Army Tactical Missile System legacy, as we progress through the upcoming procurement decision.","Moving to RMS. Our integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business was selected by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to produce two solid-state radar antenna sets for their Aegis Ashore system.","Our SPY-7 radar offers enhanced detection range and sensitivity from previous legacy radar systems and will provide continuous protection of Japan from ballistic missile threats. Our RMS team has continued to invest in new technologies, while leveraging current solutions and this new radar is a direct derivative of our long-range discrimination radar solution, a missile defense agency program of record.","Variance of the SPY-7 radar will also be incorporated into other U.S. and international solutions. And to-date this technology has been selected for 24 systems ushering in the next-generation of maritime and ground-based advanced radar technology.","Moving to Aero, this past November marked the official start of F-16 production at our Greenville, South Carolina location. Fabrication activity began for components of the center fuselage, one of the first steps in building new F-16 aircraft for the growing demand from new international customers. The first delivery for our Bahraini customer will roll off this line in late 2021 and we look forward to increasing production as new orders are added to the backlog.","I will close with our Space business area which delivered the Mars 2020 Rover Aero Shell to Kennedy Space Center in December. The Aero Shell will encapsulate the Mars 2020 Rover during its deep space mission to Mars and protect it from the intense heat as the entry system descends through the Martian atmosphere.","This Aero Shell marks the latest heat sheet ever used and will protect the vehicle from temperatures up to 3,800 degrees Farenheit. Lockheed Martin has built every Aero Shell entry system for all of NASA's 40 years of Mars explorations and we are proud to continue this legacy as we work towards a July 2020 launch.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation to the entire Lockheed Martin team for their contributions to an outstanding year and for helping to build a differentiating portfolio. Ken?","Ken Possenriede","Thank you, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","So, let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations, and earnings per share closed ahead of our expectations with record highs. We generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter. And we continued our cash deployment actions returning $3.8 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We again grew our backlog to $144 billion, a new record high watermark. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business.","Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 11% or $6 billion compared with last year to $59.8 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters, while segment operating profit increased 12% or $700 million over last year to nearly $6.6 billion.","On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. And as Marillyn mentioned, all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2019, led by Missiles and Fire Control of 20%, which was driven by a production volume in tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense. And for the first time, all four business areas delivered sales above $10 billion.","On chart 6 we'll discuss our segment operating profit by business area. Following sales, all four of our business areas also increased profit in 2019 and the corporation ended the year with total segment operating profit 12% above 2018 levels.","Chart 7 shows our earnings per share for 2019. Our EPS of $21.95 was up $4.36 or 25% higher than our results last year, driven primarily by operational performance.","Moving on to chart 8, and as previously noted by Marillyn, backlog has increased again to a record high for the fifth consecutive year. All four business areas increased backlog in 2019 with the largest increases coming from space, driven by strategic missiles and at Missiles and Fire Control, driven by air and missile defense. We had a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 for the quarter and 1.2 for the year.","On chart 9, we will discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2019. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $7.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow is greater than $5.8 billion. We increased our dividend by 9% and exceeded our share repurchase objective by $200 million in the fourth quarter. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $3.8 billion for the year or 64% of free cash flow, providing strong returns consistent with our historical cash deployment actions.","Moving on to chart 10. We provide an update to our 2020 trending data with our revised outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $62.75 billion to $64.25 billion, which is an increase from the $62 billion we first indicated last quarter. The midpoint of this range represents a 6% increase over 2019 results. The range of segment operating profit is estimated to be between $6.8 billion and $6.95 billion.","Our estimated FAS\/CAS pension adjustment is just above $2 billion. Our estimated range for 2020 earnings per share grows to between $23.65 to $23.95 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 7.7% increase over 2019 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $7.6 billion and I'll discuss this in greater detail on the following chart.","On chart 11, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational cash performance and a continued focus on working capital management allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2020 to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion, a $100 million increase to the combined 2019 and 2020 outlook we provided in October. And we now see approximately $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021, a $700 million increase bringing our three-year expectation to $800 million greater than our prior assessment.","On chart 12, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2020 led by Missiles and Fire Control at 10%. Segment operating profit growth is projected to grow at approximately 5% in the aggregate with our largest growth in aeronautics at 8%.","And finally on Chart 13, we have our summary. We believe 2019 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin. Our key results exceeded previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation in 2020. And as we discussed earlier, our focus on innovation and investment has resulted in strategic new business opportunities and a robust legacy of programs.","And with that we're ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning, Rob.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Stallard","Quick question for Marillyn. On the F-35. You mentioned in the release that your guidance had a bit of a caveat regarding Turkey. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the progress in allocating those Turkish delivery slots. And also realigning the supply chain?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure. Thanks for the question, Rob. I would just say, we've been working with the U.S. government for several months on addressing how we're going to manage the eight aircraft that were slotted for Turkey that have been delivered for Turkey as well as looking at alternate suppliers for the Turkey suppliers.","And so in terms of the Lot \u2013 the upcoming lots, we have a lot of demand for the aircraft as you are well aware and we've had the congressional ads that will offset those needs from Turkish \u2013 the Turkish aircraft delivery. So I think we've got it well solutioned. Anything you want to add to that Ken?","Ken Possenriede","Yes. Just \u2013 Rob just from the revenue side, Marilyn's got it right. So the United States government for the ones we've delivered in sub to date, which would be the Lot 10 Lot 11 aircraft. There are earmarked for the United States government. In lot 12 through 14, the block buy each of those lots eight aircraft were earmarked for Turkey for a total of 24. The congressional adds for the most part we'll take care of that. So we're in good shape with the block buy.","We'll now work Lot 15. We just got the RFP from U.S. government. So I think from a revenue standpoint, we're in great shape. We have other customers that are coming in. Japan as you recall, want to order an additional 105, we have Belgium. We're in a competition for Finland, Switzerland and Canada. We feel good about those, especially as Marillyn mentioned, the $80 million aircraft, we got there a year ahead of time. And you probably saw in the press the polls want to buy 32 aircraft. So I think from a revenue side, it's well in hand.","From a supply standpoint, almost all supply out of Poland will \u2013 excuse me, out of Turkey will be removed by March of 2020. There'll be a handful of suppliers that we'll continue to work with \u2013 through December 20th. And as I mentioned we got the Lot 15 RP, so we'll sort all that out post-2020 as we go on. But I think we're in a much better spot now than we were with the Turkey situation. ","Rob Stallard","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will move to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks and good morning. Can you laid out the 3-year cash outlook the update with the $800 million of incremental. I'm just curious, could you give us the backbone on the net pension recovery in there?","And how much change you mentioned contributions came down, but it also looks like your CAS recovery came down. So just trying to piece out of that $800 million, how much is from your operations? Thanks.","A \u2013 Ken Possenriede","You bet, Myles. So yes, I think we should start with how we ended the year with cash that got us to making the voluntary pension contribution. So we ended -- you guys recall, we ended the third quarter up in working capital by $1.2 billion.","Fourth quarter from third quarter, we actually reduced our working capital by $500 million. So for the year, we were just south of growing our working capital by $700 million.","So with that strong cash generation in the fourth quarter, we thought it was prudent to make the pension contribution of $1 billion. And so if you go forward and look at 2020 and beyond Myles, and also recall our Lockheed Martin investment company we -- our returns were superior to what we assumed back in October or frankly what we assumed in the beginning of the year. They ended the year at 20% returns on their assets.","So with all that our cash contributions came down in 2020 to just south of $2 billion. We do not -- we're not required to make a pension contribution this year. So going forward our CAS recoveries look like there'll be about $2 billion in 2021.","Our pension contribution recall the last time we spoke regarding 2021, we thought our pension contribution would be $2 billion by making the $1 billion pension contribution not only eliminated 2020 pension contribution, it reduced the $2 billion pension contribution by $0.5 billion, but also because of the great returns we made in last year. It looks like our pension contribution now in 2021 as we see it is below $1 billion.","And just going out to 2022 and then I'll stop. Looks like our CAS recoveries will be roughly $2.2 billion and that $2 billion pension contribution in 2022 that we discussed in October looks like, it's about $1.7 billion, $1.75 billion.","So a lot of it is improvement, volume improvement, margin improvement throughout the business, but some of it also is due to the returns we made on our pension in the past.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Hi good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Rob Spingarn","Marillyn, Ken you both went through a lot of detail on the international successes on aircraft and ship platforms. And Marillyn you sort of previewed the question, I want to ask when you talked about Japanese ages, but I wanted to talk about your recent modernization wins at DoD. They're sizable. You've had things like hypersonics and AM260 at MFC, Central Radar at RMS. And I wanted to see how these might translate to even greater longer-term market share internationally, or are they too strategic to export?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, that's a great question, Rob. I mean, we're always working with the U.S. government. As we look at these systems, we're always looking at what systems could potentially be provided to our allies and to increase their defense capability and capacity.","So without hitting each one of these specifically that you outlined, I mean, just -- I think the Aegis Systems is a good example. When you look at some of our increases in things like PAC-3 and FAD and now with the radar capabilities, I mentioned, the opportunities that we have on Long Range Discriminating Radar. It's all in our planning that, when we work with the U.S. government, that we make sure that we have an opportunity to consider not only the needs of the U.S. government, but on many of these systems, what they could provide to the international community.","And as you can see, with our very robust backlog, about $144 billion, it gives us an opportunity to not only perform on that work that we have, but to continue to invest in new technologies and new capabilities. And that's what we've been doing for a number of years. We have highlighted areas in the radar arena and hypersonics and directed energy.","And a whole range of systems and capabilities that we recognize, we've got to constantly provide our customers with the advantages that they need over our adversaries. And so, we're always looking well ahead of now to invest in it. And we think that, with that, it is with an eye towards being able to support our international customers as well.","Operator","Next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Yes. Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Ron Epstein","I was wondering if we could just walk through a little bit. When we think about the F-35 program, as we go into 2020 and maybe even beyond, how you think about the mix between OE and sustainment? I mean, there's been a lot of, I guess, press about the sustainment going from something like the total flight hour cost at $35,000 per hour going down to $25,000 per hour. I mean, how does that impact the program? And how should we think about as we model F-35 in the 2020 and beyond, the mix between OE and sustainment?","Ken Possenriede","Sure. Hey, Ron, it's Ken. I'll take that. So, yes, in 2020, if you look just macro at F-35 we see --we actually see pretty strong growth year-over-year. Sales are going to be up about 8%. Think of that as --the lion's share is still production. So, production year-over-year will be about 8%. But we still see development work, even with SDD winding down, with follow-on modernization and other development activities. We'll see development this year grow from 2019 about 10%.","From a sustainment standpoint, we're still on these annualized buys and we're still standing up bases. And we've talked about the performance-based logistics proposal, that white paper that we put in, so we'll see high single-digit growth in sustainment. And if we continue on these annualized buys. It will still continue to grow.","You'll see sustainment over time become the fastest piece of our --of the F-35 program. It will likely double in size from a sales perspective in the next five years. And potentially throughout the next decade, could double or triple from where it is today. But I think the PBL is an interesting concept and we're starting to have that conversation with the customer. And it basically is to talk about what you just described is to accelerate to get the cost per flight hour of maintaining the aircraft down to what the customer would see as an affordable level, but also the availability of the aircraft to get that up to levels that are more like fourth-generation aircraft and the owners then would be on industry -- the risk would be on industry.","We would do the investing for the -- for our customer set we would have the infrastructure in place. And assuming we performed, we would sign up to these service levels, we would expect a return that's more in line with that type of contract.","We're hopeful we'll be able to get to the table with the customer in 2020 and shape this thing and hopefully be able to get a deal that's acceptable to both parties. But you're right, in the future, you'll see sustainment grow faster than the rest of F-35, at least in the short-term, it will still be production until we get to capacity which should be peak capacity which should be 2023, 2024.","Marillyn Hewson","But I would add there's continued demand around the world and as we continue to -- we're now at a very affordable unit price on the aircraft. And as long as we can offset the development cost that will come as we continue to upgrade the aircraft and then drive the sustainment costs down, I think we see an outlook of great opportunities for the aircraft around the world.","Ken Possenriede","That's right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next will be Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hello everyone.","Marillyn Hewson","Hey.","Ken Possenriede","Hey, how are you doing, Noah?","Noah Poponak","Doing well. How are you Ken?","Ken Possenriede","Okay. Thanks.","Noah Poponak","So, I wanted to stay on the multiyear cash flow discussion. I could sort of see the investor question that was previously does it grow in 2021 because of the contribution step-up moving to 2022 with the contribution step-up now there year-over-year.","So, one do you grow cash from ops year-over-year in 2022? And I think you have five-year internal planning. So, maybe you could speak to -- can you grow cash flow every year in the five-year period because that just remains a big investor question?","And then having given the pension pieces I wondered if you could also speak to capital because that came in a little light for the year? That'd be very helpful. Thank you.","Ken Possenriede","Thanks Noah. Just a clarifying point from a long-range plan standpoint we do current year plus three years out. But I will give you a little -- I'll try to give you a little color 2023 and beyond, but I don't have an absolute number for you.","So, I think you wanted to start with 2022 since I gave you color up to 2021. And that's actually a timely point right now not just because of pension funding, CapEx, but just from a cash-generation dynamics including the pre-funding looking at growth our focus on working capital. It basically would all point to cash from operations out in 2022 frankly being north of our 2021 number. We see a path to greater than and equal to 77.","There is one issue that it's worth talking about now and it's the remnant from the Tax Reform Act of 2017. The law has a provision that kicks-in and it kicks-in in 2022 which requires research and development expenses to be capitalized rather than being expensed. Right now though the law is -- it's still a little bit vague what the exact definition of R&D is. And believe it or not I've actually read the legislation myself and I do see some vagueness in there. But in the interest of transparency it's probably good. We talk about that now.","So if the IRS made the determination that the law applies to all R&D expenses, it probably would take our cash number down. So this would be things we are expensing now that we would have to amortize over five years. It would take our cash from ops in 2022 probably down to about $6.5 billion. But I'll say this it doesn't seem logical to us that that was their intent and if it was just a subset of the R&D, we still see a path to getting north of $7 billion. So we're still working through this.","So just to summarize north of $7.7 billion if it's -- the way things have been operating in the past. If this R&D tax bill kicks in it will be probably in the mid-range of $6.5 billion. And if it's a subset of that, we still see north of $7 billion. But operationally we're still -- it's going to generate a lot of cash. We still have a focus on working capital.","You talked about CapEx, you're right it was a little light this year. So we ended the year at roughly $1.5 billion. Because of the things we've discussed in the past, the buildings that we're building in the business areas. We'd see CapEx in 2020 at about $1.7 billion next year probably comparable about $1.7 billion. And then what we know today, it would start tapering down. It will be below $1.7 billion.","Last point you asked about was 2023 and beyond. Just talking about Sikorsky, you'll start seeing a lot of those programs going into production; you'll start seeing F-35. We'll continue to reduce contract assets so we see -- though I don't have an absolute number for you, we see strong cash flow generation out in that time period as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hey, thanks everyone. I won't ask you about 2025 and beyond if that's okay. I spare you from that for now. But in the context of all that cash coming in what about cash going out? Leverage is noticeably low; you highlighted returning 64% of free cash flow to shareholders. It's been higher in years past, but I know your stock's been lower in years past. So just how do you think about capital allocation going forward given all these dynamics?","Ken Possenriede","Sure. So let's start John. Let's start with 2020. For planning purposes, we're assuming share repos of about $1 billion we're assuming we do increase the dividend. For planning purposes that would $0.20 a quarter or $0.80 similar to what we -- per share what we did in 2019. So around numbers and eight-plus percent increase in the dividend, we do have another tranche of debt that matures in 2020 it's $1.250 billion I believe it's the second tranche of Sikorsky. For planning purposes, we're assuming we let that mature and pay it back. Our treasury organization is constantly looking at whether it makes sense to refi or look at our entire debt on the balance sheet, whether a debt exchange makes sense. We'll go through that through the year. We will be opportunistic like we were in the fourth quarter of last year, where it makes sense from a share repo standpoint. In fact, we did our first accelerated share repurchase program. It went very well in the fourth quarter last year. And as you recall 2018 with our stock price down, nothing to do with our fundamentals but with what was going on with the market. We were very opportunistic in terms of that.","And so we'll see going forward where it makes sense to do that. What we didn't talk about is inorganic growth. Marillyn has \u2013 we meet at least eight times a year with the senior leadership team to look at a pipeline in terms of things that make sense for us to invest in or frankly to divest in.","And as you said we do have the firepower on our balance sheet to go do that. I'll remind you that we got a credit rating increase by all three agencies. So with debt being cheap, if there is something out there from an inorganic standpoint that fits within where we think we need to go with our portfolio, we would be inclined to do that.","Marillyn Hewson","But I would just remind you that we really are happy with our current portfolio. We don't see any gaps right now. But we'll as Ken said, constantly keep a screen on it as we always do.","Operator","Next we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Hi, George.","George Shapiro","A couple of questions. MFC and space backlog were up well north of 20%. Why isn't the growth rate greater in 2020? And then also if you can just go through the balance sheet a little bit. There was a big increase in inventories maybe partly offset by contract assets. And likewise accounts payable were way down maybe offset a little bit from liabilities. Maybe just walk through what's actually going on in the balance sheet as well? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","You bet, George. It\u2019s Ken. I\u2019ll handle that. So you asked about Space and Missiles and Fire Control and you're right. So our \u2013 we overachieved our orders planned this year by north of $20 billion. And two of the big drivers were exactly that Space and Missiles and Fire Control.","But I think what you need to do is look at the detail of what some of those programs are. So at Missiles and Fire Control a big driver of what went into backlog would be THAAD KSA and PAC-3 Poland. And those will be multi-year programs going forward. So you will not see a burn down like some of the tactical strike weapons programs integrated air and missile defense backlog will take longer to convert to sales.","Same with Space. Space is a platform business. And you have \u2013 recall I talked about in the past the, the multiyear, the three years of AWE we got. So we will not get an order this year on AWE. We also got some big orders on Orion and OPIR which would take longer to convert to sales.","Regarding the balance sheet, you're right George. We did have some inventory growth in 2019. But the way we look at it, I kind of look at contract assets and inventory and frankly, put them together. So we actually had contract assets decrease in 2019 by roughly $400 million. Inventory for the year roughly grew $600 million.","So I would say from an asset standpoint, we had 11% sales growth. Think of that as roughly $6 billion of sales growth from 2019 to 2020. We grew contracted assets and inventory by only $200 million.","Going forward, we do see contract assets increasing in 2021. And we see working capital in 2020 growing by rough numbers it will be comparable, little bit more than this year. But remind you, we're growing sales by roughly $3.5 billion. So that's in-line with what we've had in the past.","And then 2021, we see a marked improvement from a working capital standpoint. We will only grow working capital by say, $200 million. This is our plan today, but we'll continue to try to perform on that. And with our focus on working capital one of the main places that we will work is in contract assets in 2020 and 2021.","Operator","Next we go to you Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. Everybody has talked about cash flow. I'm more interested in kind of what you do with it because your net debt-to-cap is now 1.4, if you increase your dividend 10%.","If you buy $1.5 billion in stock every year, you're basically going to burn through like $4 billion in debt. So, where are we going here over the next couple of years? Do you want this net debt-to-cap ratio to go below one, or are you going to deploy the cash? And if so, what are your relative priorities? Thanks.","Ken Possenriede","So Cai, as I mentioned earlier, I think our priority is -- or from a plan standpoint, the debt on the balance sheet as it matures our plan would be to pay it off. We will certainly look at whether it makes sense to refi in this low interest rate environment. We certainly will look at talking to the owners of our stock as we go around this year to talk to our shareholders.","What type of dividend increase is acceptable to them for them to continue to be interested in our stock, the last couple of years though, we've planned for $1 billion of share repos, we have overachieved. We've opportunistically in the last two years have bought back more stock than we planned. There is some likelihood, we would do that as well and that -- we'll decide on that.","We talked about in the past about our portfolio as Marillyn mentioned, we're very pleased with our portfolio. But if something out there makes sense for us to acquire, we have the firepower to do that.","If you look at the composition who owns our stock, it's almost 50%, our yield, investors. So we will certainly pay attention to our yield. Even with the high appreciation of our stock, we still have a very strong dividend yield relative to our share price. But I think the net is, we're not going to let cash -- we've demonstrated this over the last couple of years, we're not going to let cash sit on our balance sheet, we will use it.","Operator","And next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. ","Doug Harned","Thank you. Good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned","I wanted to go back to the F-35 sustainment? Because I wanted to make sure I understood how the math works out here, because if I think of in a broad sense and I'll put PBL aside for the moment. But if I think in a broad sense about sustainment activity being somewhat proportional to the fleet size and if, right now, you're still building out depots.","So there's, I would think, a surge in sustainment work at the current time for that. And then, if you have to bring down dollars per flight hour over the next few years, how does this -- how do you get to a doubling or tripling of sustainment revenues in the next five years? I'm just trying to figure out how this all flows?","Ken Possenriede","Okay. You bet, Doug. So, yes, a lot going on. So, just for completeness this year, we see sustainment growing, not quite double digits, but close to double digits. So, there are roughly 21 bases that are stood up. We still have quite a few to stand up. We have a large number of 491 aircraft out in the fleet through year-end. We're going to deliver 140 aircraft this year, rough number's 160 next year; '22, 165 and then we'll start getting up to the 170, 175, 180 aircraft delivered. We'll continue, as you said, drive down the price per flight hour from roughly $35,000 to $25,000.","What I'd like to remind you though is, half of that is the government cost, half of that is our cost, but you will still continue to need sparing. Marillyn mentioned the modernization work that is continuing. You will start to see, from a sales or revenue standpoint, more modernization sales and sustainment, once we have these depots up and sparing rather than the cost of standing up the depot. So, going forward, you will see a sizable ramp in modernization cost, where the customer working with us deems which aircraft it makes sense to modernize and then the spare of the fleet.","Operator","Next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thanks very much and good morning.","Ken Possenriede","Hi, Seth. Good morning.","Seth Seifman","Can you mention the outperformance on the orders this year? I guess, first of all, where do you expect to exit the year in terms of backlog relative to last December 31? And then, in Missiles and Fire Control, when do you anticipate that the margin rate there would stabilize and then maybe start to move in the other direction?","Ken Possenriede","Got you. Okay. So, we actually see what we know today, we see our backlog this year growing roughly $3 billion, $4 billion. If you think about our orders, orders this year will not -- probably not be as strong as they were in 2019, but you do have some notable orders this year. So, this year we have three F-16 production orders in 2020; Bulgaria, Taiwan, and Morocco. We'll definitize F-35 Lot 14 this year. In the fourth quarter, we have F-35 Lot 15. There is a variety of hypersonics awards that will come out this year. We have the Indian Navy MH-60R that will occur, the Seahawk, PBL. So, our book-to-bill the way we see it this year is a little bit over 1, it's 1.06. So, we will grow backlog this year to roughly 1.47, 1.48.","Regarding Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about this in the past; you do have the development program -- the classified development program that is kicking in. It will continue to grow for the next couple of years. We've talked about some of the risk retirements that we've had in the past. Some of those will not occur this year, but it's probably next year or the year after that we would see the -- our margins start to stabilize on Missiles and Fire Control. There will be other new prototype programs.","So, if you think about hypersonics, especially in Missiles and Fire Control, it is strike hypersonics. We really were investing in the counter hypersonics, but we really haven't seen any orders there yet. Would not surprise us if we're put under contract this year and going forward for counter and those will be dilutive to margins as well.","Greg Gardner","Hey John, this is Greg. We're at the top of the hour. So, I think I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks. Let me wrap it up and conclude the call today again by thanking our 110,000 Lockheed Martin employees for their remarkable efforts over the course of 2019 because it was a year that we delivered outstanding strategic operational and financial performance. Our corporation continues to excel and attributes we most value and that's providing critical solutions to our customers and returning value to stockholders.","So, thank you again for joining us on the call today.

And welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry Kircher","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ.","Please see today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you with us to review our first quarter results. As today\u2019s release details we had an exceptionally strong quarter, financially and operationally.","The Corporation continued to operate at a very high level and returning value to stockholders while delivering critical solutions to our customers. Our Lockheed Martin team delivered broad-based results across the Corporation and I am extraordinarily proud of their focus and efforts. I want to highlight a few key achievements in the quarter and then Bruce will follow my remarks and cover the balance of the financial metrics in more detail.","Financial results for the first quarter of 2014 were higher in almost every metric than the first quarter last year, other than a slight decline in sales. While sales decreased in the quarter, they were better than our plan and we remain on track to achieve our full year sales guidance.","Noteworthy financial accomplishments were securing new order bookings significantly above last year's level and a direct reflection of our portfolio alignment with customer requirements. This strong program alignment is essential, as customers allocate resources in today\u2019s constrained budget environment.","Beyond our solid order bookings, net earnings and earnings per share each increased over 20%, while segment operating margin matched the high point in our corporate history at 13.4%.","Through our continues focus on cash generation, we delivered over $2 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, strong and growing cash generation is a hallmark of our Corporation and a key differentiator in returning value to stockholders, while enabling continued investments in the future of our business.","I\u2019m very pleased that strong year-to-date financial performance enabled us to increase full year 2014 guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. In addition to the increased guidance we were also able to reaffirm our full year orders and sales guidance based on bookings to-date and existing backlog composition.","This level of financial performance is a direct reflection of our world-class team as they deliver results on a daily basis to our customers and stockholders and I thank everyone for their efforts. In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to deploy our robust cash flow in the areas of share repurchases and dividend payments returning value to our stockholders.","In the quarter, we repurchased over $1 billion of our shares, more than double the amount we expended in the same period last year. These repurchases combined with our industry leading per share dividend payment returned approximately $1.6 billion in cash to stockholders.","Turning briefly to DoD budgets. In early March, the President released his formal fiscal year 2015 base defense budget at just below $500 billion. This budget is flat with FY 2014 and it\u2019s consistent with the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act caps established last December.","The President also proposed adding an additional $26 billion to the 2015 DoD base budget for opportunity, growth and security initiatives. If approved, these additional funds will be used primarily to increase budget for procurement and operations and maintenance activities.","The initial outline of base budget allocation signals solid support for our portfolio of programs. And we look forward to finalization of Congressional budget deliberations which are expected to be completed later this year.","Moving outside DoD budget, momentum continues to build in effort supporting our newly launched Lockheed Martin International organization and international expansion strategy. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to travel to multiple countries in both Europe and the Middle East to participate in wide-ranging discussions on our spectrum of products and services and the increasingly complex geopolitical environment, which requires agile and adaptive solutions for potential overseas customers.","While in the Middle East, I was able to tour our future Center for Innovation and Security Solutions in the UAE. This center will expand our collaboration with UAE government, academia and local business partners in helping bring forward new technologies.","Future technology applications are expected to be in area such as cyber security, integrated air and missile defense and other security-related areas. This center will be another link in our long-standing partnership with the people and government of the UAE.","My time in Israel enabled me to meet with the Prime Minister, participate in the opening of the new Lockheed Martin office in Be\u2019er Sheva, expanding our Information Systems & Global Solutions presence and lastly, celebrate the arrival of the first Super Hercules C-130J to the Israeli fleet with its unmatched airlift capabilities.","We continue to see strong and expanding International interest in our air and missile defense products, air mobility, tactical aircraft, and cyber security. These areas are already showing growth in our financials as we were able to expand the international content of total corporate revenues this past quarter. We remain solidly on track towards our goal of achieving at least 20% of international sales in the next year or so.","I\u2019d like to move to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide some color on the favorable progress the program is achieving in securing domestic and international customer support and reaching key technical milestones.","New business support of the program continues to grow, both domestically and internationally, with increased levels of annual aircraft order quantities. While the current DoD budget cap agreements for FY \u201814 and FY \u201815 resulted in some near term reductions and deferrals of planned F-35 aircraft quantities, the revised order profile still shows significant annual growth.","Fiscal year \u201814 order quantities for new aircraft are projected to increase by over 20% above prior fiscal year\u2019s levels. And fiscal year \u201815 budget projections reflect an additional expansion of over 30% in new aircraft orders. These increases in projected annual aircraft order quantities are indicative of increasing aircraft maturity and growing customer demand for this revolutionary fifth generation fighter.","International support of the program is also expanding and helping mitigate domestic pressures from constrained budgets. Another key new business milestone achieved this past quarter was the formal announcement by the Republic of Korea to procure the F-35 for its F-X fighter acquisition program.","Their decision involved the comprehensive evaluation process of competitive aircraft and makes Korea the third foreign military sales country and 12th country overall to select the F-35. We look forward to supporting the discussions between this valued ally and the U.S. government to formalize an agreement and add a multibillion-dollar order to our backlog of future F-35 work.","Turning to the development program, while new technical accomplishments were achieved on a daily basis, this quarter included the key completion of all flight test objectives of the carrier variant aircraft using the redesigned tailhook system. Success of the newly certified arresting hook clears the way for the aircraft to conduct sea trials for the U.S. Navy in October and move the carrier variant another step closer to joining the fleet.","In the area of software, we are making good progress on the Version 2B software that will enable initial operating capability of the STOVL aircraft in 2015. And we are progressing on Version 3I software that will enable the planned IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016.","Finally, we look forward to showcasing the F-35, which head overseas in July to fly at the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough Air Show in the United Kingdom. This will mark the aircraft\u2019s first appearance outside the U.S. and enable world audience to see some of the revolutionary capabilities of this next generation fighter.","Overall, the F-35 program is retiring development risk and increasing production tempo while reducing program costs. Shifting the focus on my remarks to portfolio shaping, we recently completed our acquisition of industrial defender, a leading provider of Cyber Security Solutions for industrial control systems to monitor, manage and protect critical infrastructures in such areas as electric power grids, chemical facilities and oil and gas pipelines.","Industrial Defender\u2019s offerings provide cyber security for automation system and operational environments in our national extension and strengthening of our existing IT cyber security business suite of solutions for domestic and international customers. This addition will enable us to offer an even more comprehensive spectrum of technology and services designed to face modern-day threats to those operational and information security.","Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to say that we are enormously proud to receive the 2014 Catalyst Award this past quarter as recognition of our initiatives to expand opportunities for women in business. We\u2019re pleased to be the first aerospace and defense company to receive this award as recognition of the progress we\u2019ve made in ensuring women\u2019s voices are contributing to the diverse perspective so essential in today\u2019s competitive landscape.","Embracing diversity is a business imperative of our corporation. It drives innovation and performance and it helps create and utilize the full potential of our team\u2019s human capital.","I\u2019ll now ask Bruce to go through the details of the first quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance. And then we\u2019ll open up the line for questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let\u2019s start with Chart 3, an overview of the quarter.","Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, down slightly from last year but in line with our expectations for the start of this year. Segment operating margin was very strong at 13.4% and this performance along with the improvement in our FAS\/CAS Pension adjustment increased earnings per share by 23% to $2.87.","We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations, the same amount as in the first quarter of last year and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders. And we increased our outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So we\u2019re off to a good start in 2014 extending upon our strong performance from 2013.","Turning to Chart 4 and comparing our sales and segment operating margin results for the first quarter of this year versus last year, overall sales were down 4% compared with last year. But as I just noted, this was in line with our expectations and we expect to have sequential top line growth for the remainder of 2014. Segment operating margin matched our highest level ever at 13.4% and was broad based across our business areas as we\u2019ll outline on the next chart.","Chart 5 shows the segment operating margins improve significantly over our results from a year ago. Four business areas had higher margins this quarter compared with last year with the increases for missiles and fire control and mission systems and training leading to our increased segment operating profit outlook for the year. As expected, aeronautics margin was slightly lower than last year due to a change in the program mix.","On Chart 6, we\u2019ll reconcile our earnings per share compared with the first quarter of last year. EPS in the quarter was 23% higher than a year ago driven primarily by the FAS\/CAS adjustment improvement from an expense last year to income this year along with improved segment operating margin results we just discussed. Partially offsetting this increase was the lower volume this quarter and a substantial R&D tax credit in 2013 that was not repeated this year.","If you\u2019ll turn to Chart 7, we\u2019ll discuss our cash generation and deployment in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was very strong at $2.1 billion. This was similar to our cash generated in the first quarter of last year. The last year had nearly $350 million more in tax refunds associated with pension contributions than we had this year.","And with free cash flow of $2 billion in cash return to shareholders of just under $1.6 billion, we returned 78% of free cash flow in the quarter. Also similar to last year, we expect that cash generated in the first quarter will be the highest for the year as we have both pension contributions and tax payments planned in future quarters that did not occur in the first quarter.","On Chart 8, we\u2019ll look at our share repurchases in more detail. We repurchased 7 million shares in the quarter significantly more than what we did in the first quarter of 2013. This more than offset shares added from option exercises. The stock match on our 401(k) plans and shares issued for the vesting of restricted stock as our net share count was reduced by about 4 million shares. Since we began our repurchase program at the end of 2002, we have reduced our share count by a net of approximately 31% to our current level of just over 315 million shares.","Moving onto Chart 9. We\u2019ll discuss our updated view of the guidance for the year. We are reaffirming our guidance for both orders and sales as our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, sales are expected to grow sequentially throughout the year.","Our orders are heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter similar to what we experienced last year. We increased our segment operating profit guidance by $75 million driven by the strong performance of missiles and fire control and mission systems and training in the first quarter.","We increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.25 and we\u2019ll describe that in more detail on the next chart. And we increased our cash from operations outlook by $100 million to greater than or equal to $4.7 billion recognizing our strong start to the year.","Chart 10 provides the reconciliation of our prior outlook for EPS compared with our new outlook. Our $75 million increase in segment operating profit results in $0.15 increase in earnings per share while our significant repurchase activity results in a lower average share count for the year that improves earnings per share by another $0.10. As a result, our EPS guidance is now $10.50 to $10.80 per share.","Moving to Chart 11. Our first quarter sales performance and nearly $80 billion in backlog enabled us to reaffirm our sales outlook for each of the business areas and in total.","On Chart 12, we show our new segment operating profit outlook by business area and in total. We increased our outlook for mission systems and training by $45 million and missiles and fire control by $30 million resulting in the overall increase of $75 million for the corporation.","And finally Chart 13 summarizes or provides a summary for the quarter. The first quarter represents another strong performance by the company with broad-based results operationally and financially. We had very good program execution and continue to take proactive measures that benefits our customers, our employees and our stockholders.","With that, we\u2019re ready for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - Bank of America","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Bank of America","Bruce, I hate to kickoff with pension but I will. I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you expect to see from the CAS side over the next say two to three years and also what\u2019s your expectations for pension contributions? Thanks very much.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So, Rob, there is a couple of moving pieces going on with the pension discussion; I\u2019ll try to capture in my response to your question there. So CAS is going to increase fairly significantly over the next couple of years. And I would expect that our cash contributions to our pension trust will probably be at a level close to what we\u2019re experiencing this year and maybe drop off a little bit in the year what\u2019s that 2016, the year after next.","But importantly, within the discussion of pension in the near term is we do expect to see, we just had released a new mortality table that we\u2019ve kind of teed up I think a few quarters back. And we would expect to incorporate that at the next re-measurement of our pension plans. And as at least as I think about the effects of that mortality table change sort of with current assumptions for the discount rate and asset returns, if those were held constant, sort of current course and speed as we usually do.","We\u2019d expect to see both FAS expense and CAS to be higher in 2015 than it would have been without the mortality change and FAS will actually increase by a greater amount than will CAS. So that alone would result in a slight reduction of FAS\/CAS income than what it otherwise would have been. But you should think of this as still being significantly greater at the end of the day in 2015 than what we experienced in 2015 on the order of magnitude of maybe 2x what we are seeing in 2014.","Cash on the other hand is likely to see some near-term benefit because we have been accelerating our pension contribution as required under ERISA. And so we are actually sitting pretty nicely even with the effects of the mortality table required cash contributions, those will come in sort of later years for us. But the CAS impact, the Cost Accounting Standards impact, will be updated prior to those required ERISA contributions, so we will actually get, as I said a bit of a near-term cash, net cash benefit. I\u2019ve said a lot there, hopefully that all made sense to you there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Good morning. ","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","My question is on the share repurchase plan that you guys have been offsetting for two plus years, the options issuance, et cetera. In this quarter for the first time in over two years, you broke below that 319 level. I was just wondering if you could comment on I guess the strategy with share repurchase now, are you looking at reducing the share count going forward or is this just a quarterly timing issue? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","I will try that one as well, Joe. So good question. As I think about share repurchase, I will give you kind of a winding answer here. We\u2019ve always said we are committed to offsetting share count creep by offsetting the dilutive effects, in particular by option exercises. But I\u2019d remind you that we also, especially in the first part of the year, we also increased share count for the vesting of our restricted stock units. And all throughout the year, we make additional contributions to our 401(k) match in the form of stock as well.","So those numbers tend to creep up throughout the year and what we\u2019ve said historically as well as this year is that we intend to offset that dilutive effect as I said. We also try to be opportunistic. We will do the same this year. And at least as I think, of the next three quarters or so, Joe, we\u2019ve offset most of the effect of both, well, clearly of the option exercise that took place in the first quarter as well as the RSU vesting.","We will continue to offset those option exercises and the 401(k) matches as they occur over the next three quarters. There is some variability that might play into how much we buyback associate with any potential acquisitions if any, that we would make in the rest of the year.","So sort of depending on all of the things I just described, the level of option exercises, potential acquisitions if any, we could see repos at a level that would bring cash on the balance sheet about back to the level we started the year with and we started the year with about $2.6 billion. I recognize that\u2019s not what we have reflected in our current guidance but that\u2019s kind of the way I\u2019m thinking about it right now. And maybe just one final point. I think we started the year a little under 10 million options available to be exercised.","We had about 2.3 million exercised in the first quarter, so if you sort of annualize that and that\u2019s an assumption on my part that will be spread equally there over the next few quarters. We will be at about the same level of option exercise as we were last year, 9 million plus and that would leave us literally at the end of this year with less than 1 million options left to be vested. So clearly, our rate of dilution, if you will, will start to diminish pretty significantly at the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning. Actually two questions, slide one as a clarification. MST, the implied margins for the remaining nine months, can you give us some color on why the step down, obviously outsized performance here in the first quarter, but even that looks like the step down the last nine months you can help with.","And the other is the C-130 margins, I think they are pretty impressive in terms of the margin expansion in C-130. In \u201913, it looks like you had more margin expansion here in the first quarter. When you transition to that next multi-year, is that something we have to think about a step down with? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","I'll give a shot at that, Myles, and see if Marillyn has any color she wants to add to it. So MST might look a little unusual for a couple of reasons. We did have a very strong first quarter of the year from an EBIT perspective and that kind of came in two flavors, one was we had some accelerated risk retirements that were actually planned for later in the year that simply because of good performance were accelerated into the first quarter, that obviously won't be a change to the year. But on the other hand, we actually had some just outright stronger performance than we had expected in the plan. And that's the amount if you will that we increased the full year outlook by for MST. The piece that might be missing a little bit in your thinking is, recall in the January call, we talked about the restructure cost and the phasing of some of the expenses.","These are expenses for a number of things, accelerated depreciation, some of the facility's movement, personnel movements and so forth, personnel relocation I should say. And we talked about that being about $80 million for the year. MST was about $25 million of that and Space Systems was at about $55 million of that and we expected to hit EBIT. I think I described that as about $0.16 hit to EPS overall had it not been for that restructure charge. And nearly all of that $25 million is going to fall in the last three quarters of the year for MST.","So, the same thing with Space by the way, well you didn't ask about Space. The vast majority, so I think probably of the $80 million, $75 million or so of that remaining restructure expense that we expect to incur in 2014 will hit the next three quarters, and just about equally spread about $25 million a quarter. So that's contributing to not just the MST scenario, but the lower going forward scenario for Space Systems as well. Now having said all that, as I look at the business areas and where we sit today versus where we expect to be at the end of the year, I do think we have some potential upside pressure, especially at MST and maybe a couple of the other business areas as well. But it's just a little too early in the quarter -- excuse me, a little too early in the year to recognize that goodness at this time.","I'm sorry, C-130. Yeah, I forgot you'd asked about C-130. So they were stronger to your point in the first quarter, Myles than they were last year. We had some step-ups associated with a couple of either completions or near completions of some contracts that to your point also are in advance of the multi-year. As usual, whenever we kind of get to the end of a contract is when you'll see the majority of those risk retirements take place. I think the multi-year as with all sort of DoD contracts, we started -- sort of started with a new sheet of paper in terms of starting with the cost at the lower level than maybe where we had on the previous contract.","So, risk retirements theoretically should be tougher from that lower number to begin with. So, I think your question is the right one and we'll just have to continue to see the sign of performance that we've had in the past. I'd like to think that we have with the international mix going forward and the international interest and not all of those FMS sale variety that we have some potential to keep the C-130 program close to where we are today. But you are absolutely right that there is some pressure going into the multi-year side of things.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss - UBS","Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, David.","David Strauss - UBS","On F-35, it looks like most of the growth that you're anticipating over the next couple years is on the international side. And Marillyn, you did address Korea coming into the fold, but how do you feel about overall the stability on the international side? It sounds like Italy's a little wobbly, Canada is obviously reevaluating things, just how confident are you that this backlog is pretty secure? Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, David. And I would say, we're pretty confident. I mean, we look at the next five years, close to half of our orders in the next five years will come from international customers on the F-35 program. Each one of these customers, partners, they go to their process, they periodically look at their security and their defense needs and they have to go through a decision process that, we are confident when you look at South Koreans making their formal announcement. Israel, we could potentially see additional for Israel. Australia is they moved through their procurement plan.","At some time in the future, we think Singapore will revisit the F-35 and determine when they want to buy. Canada is in their procurement process and working through that. So we feel confident that the unique capabilities of the F-35 is going to make it remain the best choice for these customers and expect it to see that go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Richard Safran - Buckingham Research","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Marillyn Hewson","Hi, Rich.","Richard Safran - Buckingham Research","I just wanted to ask a relatively simple question here about your outlook and your bookings guidance. So I noted that you didn't change it, I understand. But I thought maybe you could give us a bit of an update here on your booking guidance overall that you reported, when you reported 4Q. Can you tell us maybe for example, what has to happen to achieve or exceed the high end of the range and just how you're looking at it now?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So I'll fill it out, Rich. There is a lot of moving pieces. It's a simple question, but may not be the simple answer. There is a lot of moving pieces as you would expect at this point in the year from sort of on orders or booking outlook as you described it. So I think we\u2019re actually pleased. I know the book-to-bill might have seemed a little light to some, but we\u2019re actually pleased. We actually exceeded our estimate of what we are expecting to receive from an orders perspective in the first quarter, and a lot of that frankly was international content. So we are pleased with that as well.","As I look forward in the next few quarters, I would think we should probably see a similar pattern to last year. I think if I was a betting person, I would say the next two quarters will probably receive about $10 billion plus or minus each in the next few quarters. The biggest single order in the second quarter we are expecting is closing on the Lot 8 F-35 proposal, which by itself is probably worth about $3.5 billion. There is also the FY '14 buy for the C-5 program, think of that as $600 million or so, and international PAC-3 for probably $0.5 billion -- $600 million, the FY '14 buy of the fleet ballistic missile, about $0.5 billion, and then several satellites, including our spacecraft 7 and 8 from the GPS III program and a commercial satellite that collectively is about $0.5 billion in total.","So all of that collectively again as we say, I think it's about $10 billion a quarter, both in the second and third. And then somewhere until summer, we would expect to see a pretty good sized spike in the fourth quarter. If you just sort of back into the numbers from where we are today, that's probably about -- the numbers that I just gave you, that's probably about $16 billion or so in the fourth quarter. The biggest single item there is the C-130J multi-year, that's close to $5 billion, but that's really when we get all of our sort of new government fiscal year orders. So that's not an unusual pattern that we would expect to see there. We ended the first quarter, like I said a little higher than we thought maybe at just below $80 billion and we still think we've got a chance to be above $80 billion as we get towards the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is open.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Bruce, I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up question for you and then just one quick one. On the follow-up, you talked about the impacts of the mortality tables, and there being higher FAS relative to CAS as a result of the change in the mortality table. Is there a way for you to quantify in some sort of range how much higher the FAS might be when the CAS is a result of the change of the mortality table?","Then my question is, on CapEx, you came in at a run rate of only $400 million for the year, which would be down significantly year-on-year. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx to the rest of this year, the rate they will exit the year and what that production tied to the CapEx is in the '15 and '16?","Bruce Tanner","Jason, I'll try that one. So I should have said on the -- actually the first question, we probably shouldn't refer to it as the mortality table. We actually like the term longevity table. It just somehow sounds more appealing to us than we talk about mortality. So we'll start from now on calling it a longevity table. So I did try to tee up that we'd see an increase in both FAS and CAS as soon as that is included in our remeasurement. I did not mean to imply that FAS will be higher than CAS, simply that change in FAS will be higher than the change in CAS, if that makes sense. But even with that, and that was the point I was trying to get to, Jason, even with that, saying that our pension income, if you will, will be lower than it otherwise would have been without the mortality table, we would still expect to see our FAS\/CAS adjustment more than double from where we are today.","So where are we about $435 million or so today, that number is, and this again, as my usual caveat, current course and speed on the discount rate and asset return, but as we see the longevity table impact in 2015, that number is north of $800 million. So, and then beyond that, Jason, that number sort of continues to increase in the out years, at least for the next couple of years beyond 2015. So I look at CapEx in the first quarter, we're almost historically low. And I wish that were not the case frankly, but it just takes a while sometimes for us to sort of break the gears loose on the CapEx.","Last year in the first quarter, I think we did just north of $100 million, like $103 million or something this year, believe it or not, we're actually a little higher, at a $106 million. So we do expect to see, just as we did last year to kind of close on the number that we included when we give our free cash flow for the year. We do have some pretty good size items, including some restructure capital for the facilities movements that we talked last year, or January of this year including the space systems consolidation that are yet to play out, but those are bigger than maybe some of the ones we would typically have in an annual year, and that is expected to happen in the next three quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","On the F-35, we saw a reduction of quantities for the C-model in the President's budget, and there is the potential for further reductions in quantities if we see sequestration in 2016. Now, I know that your pricing for the program is volume dependent, but can you describe the impact if there is any on program margins related to the 2015 cuts, and what could happen to margins if sequestration goes into effect and we would see further cuts given the way you've structured these contracts?","Bruce Tanner","","So I'll take a shot at that, Doug. So it's not inconsequential, but it's maybe not as large as you might otherwise think. So clearly, we will price the current fiscal year offering Lot 8 in this case with sort of the known quantities and run those known quantities through our overhead rates, which is where some of the variability would come in from the quantity changes so that we would capture that in sort of the instant contract that we're pricing. Where we may have a bit of pressure is prior contracts, so Lot 6 and 7, for instance, would have been priced with an assumed higher quantity of F-35s going forward in Lot 8 and beyond. So sort of the overhead absorption impact of losing those quantities of aircraft will play out and hit, if you will, some of the performance of Lot 6 and 7. Obviously, we will try to mitigate as much of that as possible, but unfortunately not all of our overhead is 100% variable. So, some portion of the fixed cost will get spread in any event.","So -- and the other side of that is not so much on 6 and 7, but some of the prior aircraft and some of the other businesses with our contracts within Aeronautics are flexibly priced, cost plus in nature or fixed price incentive in nature. So there will be some sharing of those cost increases result of that base deterioration. I should remind you that all this has yet to play out completely because for instance the program of record, which is what we've tied to on the F-35 program. So while it would have had higher domestic quantities of aircraft than what we\u2019re pricing the previous few lots on, that program of record for instance did not include the South Korean aircraft quantities in it. So there is at least hopefully somewhat of a mitigating aspect of that in the not too distant future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Bruce, going back to the margin conversation, I guess the company has realigned businesses is making changes with facilities, making changes with other costs that where the numbers are pretty large, but I guess we don't know what the starting point was. So I'm sort of curious if there is a way to categorize how much more can still change from a cost perspective to boost margins? And then forgetting about this year, forgetting about next year, just bigger picture, longer-term, is this low 13% segment operating margin in the realistic scenario analysis of what the long-term Lockheed Martin segment operating margin can be?","Bruce Tanner","Let me think about that for a second, Noah. You asked a lot of detail there. I have got to get my head around it, but how much sort of my summation and how much more cost takeout potential is left. I always believe and Marillyn has engrained this in my thinking and probably the corporation's thinking, but we try to get to as much of -- as I have said this in the past, there is much of a variable cost mentality as possible. And so a lot of that is sort of environmentally dependent and not all of our business areas are sort of created equal in that regard.","So one of the more flexible businesses we have for instance is our short cycle IS and GS business, where we have a lot of facilities that are leased in nature and not owned, not all of them by the way but a lot of them are. So we've been able to flex pretty dramatically, if you just flip back to last few years at IS and GS and look at the unfortunate headcount reductions we've had to take, we've been able to maintain margins throughout that period with a pretty sizable reduction in our overall workforce.","So that\u2019s for instance one business area that has the ability to flex to match this environment. Some of our longer cycle businesses as you would expect like Space Systems, our Aeronautics they have higher capital cost content and therefore that\u2019s harder to remove, but one of the things we've been trying to do is take a look at our total square footage and optimizing our square footage around the corporation. So the moves that we just announced in November were to take out another 2.5 million square feet on top of about 2 million square feet we\u2019ve done in the past few years. So, well over 4 million in total. That\u2019s just sort of sizing the operations to the environment in which we operate. I think we\u2019re good at that. I think we are good at that across the corporation.","So you never know what you have to do until you sort of hit with the predicament that the environment throws at you, but we work it very hard. I will also remind you that probably two-thirds of our cost is in the supply base, so we try to get that as well under control. That\u2019s the big part of it as well. And while we are reducing space in some areas, we are actually growing concurrently in other areas. So for instance our Troy, Alabama facility or Camden, Arkansas where we are doing some of the THAAD production and some of the missile production, missile and fire control is actually growing.","So we've got this constant increasing and decreasing. I think we've become very good at that over the years. So I don\u2019t think that we've reached a limit as far as what we can or cannot do in the future. Then as far as the 13% long term, given that we've hit that twice and that\u2019s the highest I would say, that\u2019s a hard hurdle for us to maintain and especially in the near term as we talked about in the past with the significant growth coming on the F-35 program at lower than the overall margin rate, that\u2019s clearly going to put pressure on our ability to achieve that. The flipside of that argument though is our international content is expected to grow over the near term. I think we'll hit close to 20% this year and we could do more than that in the next couple of years even. So that typically would have a mitigating function, but overall I'd say it's going to be hard to maintain the 13%, that\u2019s just a level we've achieved infrequently and it'll be hard to maintain that going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bruce there is a lot of debate among investors on how to really think about these pension tailwinds and what they mean for the stock. I was hoping to focus in a little bit on the cash part of it. The cash tailwind from prepayments for CAS harmonization and better understand how the management team thinks about it for capital allocation of future. I guess at the extreme, some would argue that a temporary tailwind should be returned to investors in I guess above normal buybacks or something of that nature.","That might be too simple but it also seems like too simple that a tailwind that\u2019s not going to last forever has no impact on how you think about capital allocation going forward. So I am just curious if you could kind of focus then in on that and maybe help investors understand how they should treat it for the purposes of allies in the stock? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Well John, I appreciate the question. I think it's a very well thought out question. So let me try to address everything you described there. So in years past and not this year we've tended to whenever give the EPS performance we've given adjusted EPS try to take into account the fact that we thought our GAAP reported earnings were probably understated relative to the valuation of the company."," And that wasn\u2019t necessarily good measure for our investors to be basing their valuation of the stock upon. And so now we've got the flip situation that were our reported earnings are actually getting a tailwind as you said because of the FAS\/CAS adjustment. So what I have been trying to preach for a number of years is that the real valuation upon which the stock should be valued is the cash flow and sort of the cash flow per share to be specific with that.","So at least as we look at even with the substantial conversion from expense to income this year, as I said, I think $430-ish million or so of income added to our segment operating profit that takes us to the current outlook again of about $10.55 to $10.80. I think our free cash flow per share this year is somewhere north of $11.30.","And so when I think of cash deployment in particular and I look at the payout ratios from a dividend perspective or in the cash available for share purchases, I'm very much focused on our sort of free cash flow per share. And I think that number grows over the next couple of years, potentially pretty significantly as we start to finally recover some of this $9 billion or so that we've had pre-funded into our pension trust that we've yet to recover via our billings to the government.","Now the mortality table that I've just described has some longer term implications that I've described. Obviously as people live longer that will require additional contributions over the longer term that should get reimbursed on our CAS contracts. But as I said earlier and I forgot who asked the question, in the near term, that actually is an upper to cash flow because we don't expect to have near term much of an incremental increase in our required contributions but our CAS to our government customers will reflect that mortality table change earlier.","So this is -- that's the way I think of it. Very much looking at it from sort of a free cash per share basis and on that basis I think we still got some upside from both the dividend potential as well as share repurchase potential going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Hi Ron.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning Ron.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just want to ask maybe a question on -- a broad question on capital allocation. So when you think about Lockheed's stock at current levels and buying it here. Do you think there's other places that the corporation can invest for growth? Right, arguably buying back the shares helps the earnings per share, but it's not really a strategy to fuel growth for the future, right. I mean, are there other things to do and really contemplating it. Can you talk about that?","Bruce Tanner","I'm going to give a shot and I think Marillyn -- may actually probably here as well. But so we're not -- this is not an idle conversation that we have. We don't automatically drop to the fact that we need to be buying back shares and that's the best use of capital. We actually do look at growth opportunities for the corporation. We did two small acquisitions in the first quarter as we described.","We did those because we do believe that there is growth potential in both of those acquisitions. And so the other thing we try and do is invest internally. So as you think of some of our independent research and development, if you take a look over the last two years, we're up some $100 million or so and just the level of IRAD.","So we're trying to do what's right from a -- supporting our shareholders as well as supporting internal growth. I mentioned we just invested in a terrific facility in Palo Alto in California to create a new lab for our -- one of our organization out of Space Systems that's sort of forward-looking piece of that business.","So I think we're making those right decisions, but honestly as we look at the environment right now there's not enough of those to justify the ample cash that we are throwing off right now as a very mature business and in an environment that we're in from an overall budget perspective. And probably the last thing you would want us to do is to go chasing growth and overpaying for growth. So given those prospects, I think what we're doing is is what most investors would hope us -- for us to do and we're doing that in a very thoughtful and hopefully prudent manner.","Marillyn Hewson","I'd just add to that as well, Ron, that if you look at the things that we are investing, and as Bruce said we were up on our R&D expenditures last year. Over the past five years, we've invested more than $3 billion in the research and development, things like advanced materials, advanced manufacturing, we're doing things in autonomy and robotics, so the acquisitions remain in the unmanned space, quantum computing, cyber, energy.","There is a lot of areas that we're continuing to invest in. And importantly, we're also continuing to invest in our current portfolio to keep it relevant. So making sure we're listening to our customers, extending the range, for example, on the PAC-3 and THAAD and JASSM and some of the key capability, LRASM are opportunities that we look at it offering different variants of the LCS to the international marketplace.","We are definitely continuing to maintain that portfolio and look for opportunities, advanced concepts and things that we can do to stay ahead of what our customers' needs are. You saw probably the SR-72 that we rolled out, which was a capability we've been working on for a number of years and we've got a ways to go yet and demonstrate it.","But having an intelligent surveillance reconnaissance capability with the potential for strike platform, which is very interesting. That's just one example, but one that I think makes the point if we're going to continue to do what we do as a corporation to be focused on being a technology leader because that is the value that we create for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey good morning. Almost afternoon.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays ","Bruce just one clarification and then a question if I will on the longevity table as you stated. The dynamic for 2016 and '17, if you look out beyond '15, presumably it's the same sort of impact in terms of FAS being revised up more than CAS on a relative basis in those years similar to what you're seeing in '15. Is that correct?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, it is Carter, but I'll make the -- hopefully the same point that I tried to make on the 2015. Even after that adjustment, we would still expect to see increasing pension income even after the longevity table is implemented from '15 to '16 to '17.","Carter Copeland - Barclays ","You're still expecting a pretty sizable step out to the contribution out there and I guess, its '16 or '17.","Bruce Tanner","So we've got a fairly large contribution required in '17 that we've also got a fairly large CAS recovery as we kind of get to the end of the CAS harmonization timeline there. So I would expect -- I'll say net-net cash from our pension to actually increase over those same years that you just described.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay. And then with respect to the DoD or the domestic versus the non-DoD or international growth. And with respect to the 4% decline this quarter, how would that have looked on a domestic versus international basis? And if you could do the same for bookings, that would be helpful as well?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, so I think -- and I'm doing this with little at top of my head Carter, but at the discussion we had with the media earlier today, I made the point that if you just take a look at our DoD sales on a standalone basis, they dropped 4% from the year 2012 to the year 2013. And then we expect pure DoD sales to drop another 6% from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014.","So a 10% drop year-over-year from '12 to '14. What's lost in some of that discussion though was we actually expected 2014 before sequestration to actually have an increase in sales amount. So arguably from a planned perspective, we're actually down more than the 6% that I talked about just now because that's sort of going actuals to the end of the year expected actuals and not recognizing what it otherwise could have been without sequestration.","Hopefully, that made some sense to you. In the quarter itself, so in the non-DoD or the international content specifically, we're looking at something like a 13% increase year-over-year in our total international sales, and that's -- and as a guess, from a total perspective we're going from roughly 17% to right at or just a little bit below 20%. So but for the international growth, we would have seen a much larger impact because the DoD is again decreasing about 4% cliff. So the reason we're sort of down only the 1% or so that we're guiding towards is because of the mitigating effects of the international sales.","Jerry Kircher","Stephanie, this is Jerry, I think we're coming up on the hour, so maybe we'll just turn this over to Marillyn for closing comments.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks Jerry. As we conclude today, I want to restate that the Corporation had another outstanding quarter and is well positioned to deliver even higher value to stockholders and customers as we progress through 2014. Our robust cash generation, strong backlog of domestic and international work, a solid balance sheet and the exceptional execution of our employees will continue to propel our corporation forward in 2014 and beyond.","I'm confident in our future and because of the outstanding innovation, performance and integrity of our workforce. We will continue to support our customers in their essential missions. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July.

Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments.

Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our financial results and key accomplishments in the quarter, as well as provide a status update on the strategic initiatives we announced during our July earnings call.","As today's release illustrates, we continue to drive towards achievement of our full-year goals with another quarter of solid operational accomplishments and financial results that exceeded our expectations. This outstanding year-to-date financial performance enables us to, again, increase full-year 2015 guidance for sales, operating profit and earnings per share.","In addition to the increase to guidance, we reaffirmed the prior 2015 outlook for full year orders and cash from operation. Overall, the corporation continues to excel in the attributes we most value, providing critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders.","Looking beyond this year into 2016, we have provided our preliminary trend outlook of selected financial metrics and assumptions. I wish to note that these trends reflect a continuation of our current portfolio. We have excluded any impacts of the pending Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation acquisition or the strategic review of our information technology infrastructure services and technical services businesses.","In addition to the open elements resulting from these pending strategic actions, there is continuing uncertainty about the final level of fiscal year 2016 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal level and is carried through December 11, 2015.","For the large portion of our backlog work already funded from prior fiscal years, we do not expect significant impact to our 2016 financials from this current short-term CR. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios proposed by the White House and Congress for FY 2016 budgets. Significant differences remain between the proposed budget in the areas of funding sources and the potential use of increased overseas contingency operations funds for DoD.","Reconciliation of the different DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope that this is not the case as it is not in the nation's interests. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 11. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY 2016 year, should the varying budget positions remain unresolved.","In the event of a full-year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2016 orders profile and corresponding backlog levels. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of the FY 2016 budget to remove the uncertainties associated with non-strategic, short-term government funding actions. We will provide updates to our 2016 outlook as additional clarity on federal budgets and finalization of our strategic actions occur.","While Bruce will cover the financials in detail a little later, I want to particularly highlight our continued exceptional cash generation. This quarter, we achieved over $1.5 billion in cash from operations, bringing the September year-to-date cash generation to over $3.7 billion. Also during the quarter, our board of directors approved two key actions in the areas of cash deployment. First, we increased the quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share and $6.60 annually. This action represents the 13th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by double-digit percentages.","Second, we also increased the share repurchase authority by $3 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make share repurchases consistent with our plan to have less than 300 million shares outstanding by the end of 2017, if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. These projected share repurchases, coupled with dividend payments, are expected to result in our returning the vast majority of annual free cash to stockholders through 2017 and continuing our longstanding strategy of disciplined cash deployment and value creation.","Moving to operations. While numerous mission success events were achieved across the corporation this past quarter, I wish to highlight some noteworthy achievements on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in our Aeronautics business. On JSF, we were extraordinarily pleased with the achievement of initial operational capability for the F-35B variant in July. The declaration of IOC by the U.S. Marine Corps makes it the first F-35 variant available for combat operations and achieved an enormous milestone for the program.","Other key F-35 milestones accomplished this quarter included a number of firsts on the program, including the inaugural European flight of the first F-35 assembled at Italy's final assembly and checkout facility. This marked the first time a jet has flown outside of the United States. Additionally, rollout of the first F-35 aircraft for the Norwegian Armed Forces was accomplished this past quarter, marking an important production milestone for the future of Norway's national defense.","Beyond these key milestones, aircraft production continues to ramp up, and we are on track to achieve deliveries of approximately 45 aircrafts in 2015, representing 25% higher aircraft deliveries than were achieved in 2014. Since program inception, we have delivered 140 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners.","The F-35 program continues to expand and is now generating approximately 20% of annual corporate revenues. This figure is expected to grow over the next few years as production rates increase for deliveries to U.S. and international customers.","I'd like to briefly turn to a status of the two strategic actions we announced back in July. First, the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation continues to progress through the regulatory review process. Competition-based regulatory reviews have been completed in seven jurisdictions, importantly including the United Sates where we and Sikorsky have the most activity.","The sole remaining such review is ongoing in China, which we are expecting to clear without difficulty. Other regulatory activities, such as licensing and permitting, continue in process. We had previously announced that we expected to close the acquisition in either the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016.","But with the progress of the regulatory reviews, we now expect to close in the fourth quarter. We very much look forward to adding the men and women of such an outstanding company to the Lockheed Martin team where we will continue to make history together.","Regarding our second action, the strategic review of our government information technology, infrastructure services and technical services businesses, we continue to evaluate multiple options, ranging from a spinoff to shareholders, a Reverse Morris Trust transaction or a sale of these businesses.","Exploration of these options is intended to ensure that these businesses are best positioned to address competitive pressures on what is becoming an increasingly difficult environment by improving the affordability of their products and services. This should benefit customers, our stockholders, and the employees. On that note, I particularly wish to thank the affected employees for their continued focus and outstanding performance while we evaluate the strategic review options. I believe we are on course to complete the strategic review in 2015, and we will provide an update on our action plan when the final decision is completed.","I will now ask Bruce to go through the details of third quarter and full-year financial performance and our 2016 financial trends preview. And then we'll open the line for questions.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Beginning with chart 3, we have an overview of our third quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $11.5 billion, ahead of our expectations when we spoke in the second quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected in the quarter at 11.9% and enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $2.77.","Cash from operations in the quarter was strong at $1.5 billion and reflects an earlier phasing of cash in the second half of the year than we had planned. Our cash deployment actions in the quarter remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders, including more than $800 million in share repurchases. And based on these results, we are increasing our full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit and earnings per share. So we continue to perform well in 2015 and are positioned to end the year better than we expected when we began the year.","On chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating margin in the third quarter with our results in 2014. Sales were higher by about 3% compared with the third quarter of last year, with the growth driven by the F-35 program and Aeronautics and the ramp-up of new programs in Mission Systems and Training.","Segment operating margin was slightly lower in the quarter at 11.9% versus the 12.1% we experienced last year. Space systems had good performance in the quarter but could not equal the results from the third quarter last year, which were the highest of any quarter in 2014. Improved performance in Aeronautics and Mission Systems and Training helped to bring the overall margin this quarter to near the results in 2014.","Chart 5 compares our earnings per share this quarter with our results from a year ago. Our EPS of $2.77 was $0.01 higher than the results from last year, but the results this quarter included a negative $0.08 impact from a severance charge associated with IS&GS.","If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll review our share repurchase activity for the quarter and year-to-date. During the quarter, we repurchased more than 4 million shares for $823 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 12 million shares repurchased for $2.4 billion. Both the quarter and year-to-date totals significantly exceed our levels from last year. And we are now expecting to spend at least $3 billion for the full year of 2015, keeping us on track to bring our share count below 300 million by the end of 2017.","Chart 7 provides details into our total cash returns to stockholders through the end of the third quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases during the first three quarters, we have provided nearly $3 billion in cash to our stockholders, or 117% of our free cash flow through the same period. As you can see, this is significantly higher than our actions in 2014.","On chart 8, we discuss our updated outlook for our full-year 2015 results. We are not changing our guidance for orders at this time. We continue to expect that the fourth quarter will have the highest level of orders in the year with a number of large digital events such as the finalization of the C-130J Multiyear and F-35 LRIP 9 contracts and the award of a Long Range Strike Bomber program.","Depending on the timing and ultimate value of some of the expected orders in the quarter, we could end the year in excess of the high end of our guidance but remain confident that under the most likely scenarios, we will end the year with $80 billion or more of backlog.","Because we have increasing clarity on the year, we are providing point estimates rather than ranges for the remaining metrics. Beginning with sales, we are increasing our outlook to $45 billion, the high end of our previous outlook, reflecting higher-than-expected sales in Aeronautics and Space Systems for the full year.","For segment operating profit, we are increasing our outlook to $5.4 billion, $25 million above the high end of our previous guidance, recognizing stronger performance across the business areas. We're also increasing our earnings per share outlook at the top end of the prior guidance as a result of the increased profit outlook.","And we are leaving our cash from operations outlook unchanged at equal to or greater than $5 billion, but there are several large collections that could push that number higher or lower than our expectations depending on their timing. These include the collections associated with the contract finalizations that I mentioned earlier as well as the timing of deliveries in December.","Chart 9 provides our sales outlook by business area for the year, also with point estimates for each of the business areas rather than the ranges we provided in the prior outlook. Both aeronautics and space systems are now above the prior high end of our guidance for sales.","Chart 10 shows our current outlook for segment operating profit by business area compared to what we were expecting the last quarter. You can see that our current outlook for each business area is equal to or better than last quarter's outlook and results have increased to $5.4 billion.","On chart 11, we provide our first outlook information for 2016. We expect sales next year will be comparable to the current outlook for 2015 but is driven primarily by two business areas moving in opposite directions, Aeronautics and IS&GS.","Aeronautics is expected to grow at a high single-digit rate over 2015 while IS&GS is expected to decrease in 2016 by an even greater rate. Sales for the other three business areas combined are essentially comparable to their 2015 levels. Without the reduction in IS&GS, we would expect the remaining portfolio to grow about 2% over the 2015 level.","Segment margin will likely be in the 11% to 11.5% range with a reduction from this year's level, attributable to several items. First, the F-35 program will grow more than double digits above the 2015 level, and while the margin for the program is expected to be higher in 2016, it is still dilutive to both the current level of aeronautics margin and the overall company's margin.","Second, we are seeing a reduction of margins on recently negotiated programs such as C-130J, air and missile defense programs and others after several years of strong performance, and we've also made a number of important strategic bids that were highly competitive but which offer long-term value creation.","And third, we are expecting reductions in revenue for some of our programs such as GMLRS, ATACMS, Javelin, and fire control programs as in-theater demand slows down from 2015 levels. These programs experienced unplanned demands from OCO funding that enabled better than historical margin levels in recent years.","At this time, we expect our FAS\/CAS benefit to be $810 million next year, which assumes a discount rate of 4.25% and zero return on our assets from the current year. These obviously can both change between now and yearend, but that's where we see them today.","Our cash from operations should be comparable to 2015, and we do not expect to make any contributions to our pension plans next year. And in line with our plan to reduce share count below 300 million by the end of 2017, we expect to make share repurchases of greater than or equal to $2 billion in 2016. Importantly, please note that this outlook excludes both the Sikorsky acquisition and any actions related to our businesses under strategic review.","Finally, on chart 12, we have our summary. We've had strong performance through the first three quarters of the year, and we expect a strong close to 2015. We're maintaining our focus on the cash deployment action that you've come to expect from us. And we continue to like how our portfolio positions us for the future.","Before closing, I also wanted to make a few comments about the strategic actions that we announced last quarter. As Marillyn said, we expect to reach a decision on the path forward for our businesses under strategic review before the yearend, and we'll communicate that decision to you then. And when we outline our formal guidance in January for 2016, we will provide that guidance in a business area structure that will reflect all businesses under strategic review in IS&GS, including the technical services business for Missiles and Fire Control, and the realignment of the remaining businesses from IS&GS into Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","First, I just want to dive a little bit deeper on the margin outlook for 2016. There were a couple of things that you mentioned, C-130, air missile defense, and then some strategic bids. I'd like to get a little bit more color on each of those. C-130 and air missile defense, have those been definitized at this point, or are we still waiting for that to happen? And then on the strategic bids, can you just walk us through what segments those are impacting and just kind of the competitive dynamics that are going on there?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sort of a mouthful there, Jason. Let me try to cover all of these things. So margins, we talked about C-130, air missile defense system, other programs. So, C-130, we're just coming off of a number of contracts that were negotiated essentially with the same timeframe, and we're about to start delivering next year actually. The first aircraft associated with the multi-year contract that we're \u2013 we've just reached the handshake agreement here within the last couple of weeks.","So, as you can imagine, we've done very well based on our previously reported results on those aircrafts where it's sort of a reset, if you will. When you start negotiating the next contract, you start with the exit performance in mind. And then you have to start seeing if you can improve off of that now higher bar, if you will, of that performance. So that's sort of the C-130. Again, as I said, that we did reach handshake within the last couple of weeks.","The air and missile defense program, kind of a similar story, a lot of PAC-3 negotiations. So the early stages of that program, we performed very well, again sort of reset some of those contracts going forward. We just \u2013 we reached agreement on fiscal year 2014 and 2015 here recently although none of those, including the Multiyear are, at this point, definitized. We suspect that they will be before the end of the year.","And then I talked about strategic bids. So just to rattle off a few of them and you should think of this as sort of impacting a lot of the business areas, not just one single business area but things like the bomber program that we're hopeful is announced this year. Obviously a very strategic bid, obviously one that does have long-term value creation for the corporation but one that we did view very strategically and we bid it accordingly.","You can also think of programs such as a number of radar programs like, for instance, the Long Range Discriminating Radar, the 3DELRR program. Within our Missiles and Fire Control business, a couple of things going on there, so programs like the Joint Air-To-Ground Missile, the JAGM, that we ran recently. It's essentially the replacement of the HELLFIRE missile, obviously an important franchise program for us going forward.","And then, within the ground combat vehicles, although it's still under protest, the LTV was one of those. You may not have been watching quite as closely the Amphibious Combat Vehicle for the Marine Corps but that's another one that we're tracking very closely. And then, you didn't mention that, Jason, but in the remarks that I made a comment about a number of sort of overseas contingency operations programs being expected not to be funded at the same levels going forward as they were in 2015 and previously. Think of that as there's a lot of use of the sort of the expandable items that those programs make up with sort of unplanned orders that increased the volume of activity unexpectedly higher than we have priced, and we have the benefit of that unplanned volume. We're not planning on that in 2015 going forward.","So, I think that hopefully covered a bunch of the items you were talking about, Jason. And I'll stop there and go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Good quarter, guys.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Pete.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, guys. On the 2016 guidance, is there upside to the flattish top line, if we do get a budget before the end of this calendar year or is a risk if we don't?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pete, I'll take that one. I don't see a whole lot of swing one way or the other quite honestly in 2016. The vast majority of sales that will be recognized in 2016 are already in backlog or we would expect them to already be in \u2013 to be in backlog by the end of this year. Essentially, other than, again, IS&GS which is the short sort of turn business within the corporation, we would not expect orders that would be received in the fourth quarter of this year, the first year of the fiscal year for the government to necessarily translate into a lot of sales next year. And you should think that as a continuing resolution, you can't have new start programs, you can't spend more in the new fiscal year than the prior fiscal year.","The rest of the business areas like IS&GS, that's not going to be a hindrance. I mean, again, we're expecting that business area to actually decrease in the volume. So, we wouldn't expect to have a huge impact from what we're guiding as a result of the CR. But conversely, as I said, we wouldn't expect to see upside either.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning. How are you?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Rich.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Marillyn or Bruce, in the release, you note that you may be at risk for reimbursement in excess of cost. You're still in negotiations and the concern that current funding is insufficient to cover your production cost. I wanted to know if you could provide more clarification on your statements in the release, discuss the impact it might have on your $5 billion full-year cash flow goal for 2015. Also, and if you could just tell us when the deadline would be for receiving funding such that the $750 million you mentioned in cash you expect to collect could be pushed into 2016?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bruce, why don't you take that one?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Rich. Let me take a shot of that. I'll probably maybe give you more color than you maybe really want for that, but \u2013 so you should think of this affecting a number of very large programs, specifically just to name two, but it's not limited to those two, the C-130J Multiyear and the LRIP 9 negotiation. Again, C-130J, we did reach handshake, as I said earlier to Jason, just a couple of weeks ago. We're still in the process of negotiating LRIP 9. But on both contracts, think of this as where we received initial funding to start work. This is typically described as sort of long-lease funding or advance procurement funding. We literally take that money and begin to work with our supply chain to start funding the supply chain. It doesn't honestly go in the earlier stages to do a whole lot of work for Lockheed Martin because we're further down that food chain, if you will, than our suppliers.","In both cases, we ran out of funding provided. In both cases, we asked for additional funding. And in both cases, we were told that none would be provided until those contracts were actually negotiated. This was a little change, frankly, from historical \u2013 my experience at least, historically as to how we get funding. Ordinarily you get long-lease funding; when you reach the end of that long-lease funding, you ask for additional funding which usually comes in the form of an undefinitized contractual action, or UCA, as it's called, or you actually end up with a negotiated contract.","For whatever reason, the government in this case decided not to fund until we reached negotiation. And so, we were faced with a decision of do we actually disrupt the supply chain \u2013 and you can imagine the kind of disruption that that creates, telling potentially hundreds of thousands \u2013 hundreds to thousands, excuse me, of suppliers to stop work, furlough their employees, potentially lay off employees and then having to restart that effort. And most of our supply chains simply can't afford to fund this on their own. So, with that in mind, we decided to continue funding those programs, again, primarily funding our suppliers as opposed to Lockheed Martin.","You should think also that the funding needs on these programs starts to accelerate pretty dramatically at certain points in time. In the case of both of those programs, from the summer time until the end of the year the funding needs increase dramatically. And that's why we disclosed that in the earnings released to you today; that's why we'll disclose that in the 10-Q that you'll see in a couple of days.","I'll tell you, we have elevated this to various senior levels at the Pentagon. We've been told that funding will be provided on both those programs, but it does require, I'll say, a lot of paperwork, notifications, contract modifications and the like to make it happen. We think that will occur this year, but obviously a lot of cash is tied up. And we want to make sure that we at least notified you of that. Honestly, it's a little bit difficult for me to understand as to why we're in this situation. You really have to ask the folks in the Pentagon as to why we're in this spot.","As far as \u2013 you did ask the question, as far as cash in 2015 (sic) [2016], above or below 2015, we do need \u2013 we identified the value of the two particular items for both the Multiyear and the F-35; it's worth about $0.75 billion. But timing-wise, we need to get that probably notification and ability to bill sometime before Thanksgiving typically to sort of get that by the end of the year. That's not always the case. Sometimes we can get it if it happens in the early December timeframe.","But just to be certain, that's when it would sort of be helpful to make that happen. And you should think of this, between the two years, 2015 and 2016, if it doesn't happen in 2015 it will happen in 2016. You should think of the two years still being the same cash value, just how much of that happens in 2015 versus 2016. So, current plan is $5 billion and $5 billion. If we were short, $750 million, we would add that $750 million to next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Noah.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wondered if you could address this recent press about some possible fairly large corporate overhead cost reduction. It's hard to tell what's related to the government IT business review and what's part of the remaining business. It would seem like a fairly large number that's out there if it is in fact a decent amount in the remaining business.","And then related or I guess, depending on your answer to that, related, Bruce, in the past you've commented when you've given your initial segment margin outlook about qualitatively how much conservatism is in it or how much upside risk there is. And I guess I wonder if there's more cost coming out than normal, is there more upside risk or not? Thank you.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take your first question, Noah. I did see the press that was around a 30% overhead reduction. Let me just put some color around that for you. I mean, we are always looking at our business structure and looking at different excursions we should take in order to keep our business competitive within the business environment that we operate in. So I'm looking to target the 20%, 30%, 40%.","I mean that \u2013 so just to put it in perspective, this is a matter of us constantly looking at where the opportunities are for us to be as affordable as we can and how we adjust our business base to the business environment that we're operating in. We look at the supply chain. We look at overhead and we look at performance of the business areas. Every year, the business areas set affordability targets that they then look at both production and overhead cost reductions that they can take, improvements in their processes. And similarly, we do that at the corporate level.","So that's the essence of that. Bruce, I think you'll take the next part.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No effect on \u2013 I think just to repeat your question, the initial segment margin outlook, in years past we sort of talked about potential to do better than that going forward. I'll say, Noah, 2016 initial guidance that we're providing is very similar in terms of expectations of upside or downside as to what we've done in years past.","If you go back and look at 2014 and 2015, for instance, from the start of the year to the end of the year we saw improvements in both of those years in terms of the overall company segment margin because we performed better on certain programs, and that has enabled us to take step-ups during the year that resulted in that higher performance, that higher segment margin.","So, as I always say, I think we have the same opportunities. As I look at 2016, that doesn't make it happen just because I think there are opportunities there. It actually takes a lot of work to make those materialize, but we surely believe we are sitting here with the same opportunities as we had in 2014 and 2015.","And then I think you tried to link that with the potential reductions that Marillyn talked about. I don't see a whole lot of swing around those, even if those were at the full value that was reported in the press, which I don't particularly think there's a high likelihood of that, but I wouldn't expect that to have a very significant impact on the overall company margins at all.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ron.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Marillyn, I have a big picture question for you. Post the announcement of the Sikorsky transaction, the DoD came out and said, you know what, we don't want to see any more big M&A and they suggested that the consolidation in the industry has been anti-innovative and then kind of notably your company came back and took issue with that. Can you elaborate on that, I mean, your thoughts on consolidation and the impact that it had or not had on innovation?","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I'll be happy to. Thanks for the question, Ron. I guess, I've had a lot of discussions with Frank Kendall and others about this policy statement that he put out and respectfully I told him that we disagree with that, that his general conclusion and his rationale that consolidation in the industry is bad for the industry. There's really no evidence to support that. There's no evidence to support that with our Sikorsky acquisition that we reduce competition or inhibit innovation in any way.","And in fact, if you look at our performance, we have consistently delivered the best and most sophisticated defense capabilities in the world. We're going to \u2013 we intend to continue to do that. We successfully compete for opportunities that come about, and we invest in advanced technologies every day. We offer cost-effective solutions. We wouldn't be able to be reporting out the type of financial results that you're seeing and have been seeing for the last several years without performing well. And we're performing well for the Department of Defense. We're performing well for other government agencies and for other countries around the world in what we're doing.","And so I wholeheartedly disagree that through consolidation, through some change in size of a business, that that's going to impede our innovation and somehow inhibit our innovation. I recognize that from the perspective of the Department of Defense, they have to make sure they've got a competitive industrial base. And so that \u2013 they have to maintain that proper balance. But really, we believe that you have to continue to look at how you can be most effective. It's not about the size of the company. It's about performance. I mean that's been the standard for \u2013 in our free enterprise system forever. And I think it's what makes us strong as a nation.","And, actually, if you consider what would the alternative be to be a smaller company and break it up, it could actually cost you more. I think the \u2013 with the economies of scale that come with what we can bring together in our business, and how we can invest in research and development, how we can invest in the capital expenditures that we need to. And as Bruce just described to you, how we can help to fund suppliers through a period of \u2013 between contract negotiations, we would not be able to do that if we didn't have the economies of scale that we have today. So bottom line, as you can feel \u2013 hear it from my passion in my voice, we do not believe the consolidation will inhibit innovation in the industry. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick clarification on the comment around IS&GS, Bruce. The higher rate that you stated, was that a higher rate of decline than the 2015 number or a higher rate of decline than the high-single digits that you pointed to for the aerospace growth, just wanted to clarify that? And then I also wondered if you'd give us a bit of an update given the Q4 close on Sikorsky, what that does in terms of the timing of the integration costs and the synergy targets that you had laid out before in terms of what \u2013 how much of that comes into 2015 or how that impacts 2016 relative to what you said on the last call? Thank you.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. You bet, Carter. So, sorry if I wasn't clear in the words to begin with on the IS&GS, but the latter is the short answer to that. IS&GS is decreasing at a faster rate than the single-digit \u2013 high-single-digit rate of growth for aeronautics in 2016. So, IS&GS will be decreasing at higher than a high-single-digit rate in 2016, if that makes sense.","And then to your question as to Sikorsky and the timing and how that potentially changes integration costs and synergy costs, I wouldn't expect they would have a huge impact on the integration costs or the ability to achieve synergy. We're still looking at spending, and I think the last time I talked to you, $80 million to $100 million or so of integration costs probably in the first year. And that's in large part to accelerate the synergies that we expect are there with the Sikorsky integration.","We expect that will still take place in 2016. What will change or what will not necessarily change but will be greater clarity is that now a lot of the transaction costs associated with closing of the Sikorsky deal will hit in the fourth quarter of this year.","So, you should think of that rough order of magnitude, and I hope we're on the lower end of this, but probably accounting for $0.10 to $0.15 impact to earnings per share in the year. And we thought about that relative to describing that in the guidance we provided. But we're still hopeful, quite honestly, that we can have an R&D research and development tax credit that will pass this year and that offsets \u2013 that actually more \u2013 probably maybe more than offsets that impact of the transaction cost of 2016.","So net-net, we would expect to see those costs hit in the fourth quarter, but we're also hopeful that the R&D tax credit more than mitigates that also in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bruce, I was hoping you can touch back on Sikorsky for a second. In terms of doing the alignment of their accounting with your accounting inside of Lockheed, how the margins of Sikorsky might behave. And then also related, as you look at the $5 billion cash for next year and substituting out the IS&GS or IT tech services business for Sikorsky, what's the put and take for from a cash flow perspective?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, Myles, we're going to give you in January a whole lot more insight into Sikorsky, assuming it closes in the fourth quarter of this year. We made some \u2013 obviously when we did the due diligence process with Sikorsky we made some relative assumptions as to, I'll say, the conforming accounting that we expect to do.","I tried to tee that up, I think, in the last call, and I literally don't have any better information to give you than what I provided to you on the July call. I'll give you, I think, much great insight into that when we actually provide the formal guidance in January not just for the rest of the company but for Sikorsky in particular as well, again, assuming we close that in the fourth quarter.","As far as the $5 million of cash next year, it obviously depends on when the strategic review culminates. We're looking at depending on whether it's a sale, a spin or a Reverse Morris Trust somewhere in probably the middle of next year to the third quarter of next year. So, I would like to think that we may be able to offset most of that if it were to spin or be sold or did a Reverse Morris Trust next year.","Again, with both the spin or Reverse Morris Trust or the sale, we would expect to get cash proceeds back. I know that's not operating cash flow but it would be greater, frankly, than whatever the shortfall is that we would expect to lose with the transfer of that business outside of the corporation. So, probably a little bit of a wishy-washy answer, but I don't know given the timing of when that deal would close and the timing of the cash flow in the year for IS&GS just to really give me a good idea what that benefit would look like or detriment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Marillyn, I guess, could you give us like kind of a big picture view on what you're seeing from international customers? I know there's been a lot of volatility in the oil-exporting countries, and have you seen any slippages or \u2013 and maybe just related to that, Bruce, are there any significant programs that we should be thinking about for 2016 in terms of international contracts? Thanks.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Peter. We are just continuing to see strong demand in the international marketplace for our programs. Missile defense continues to be a big driver for a lot of the Asia-Pacific and Middle East countries, things like THAAD, Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot needs. There is a continued demand for that. You know that we continue to have the demand for our tactical aircraft, the F-16, the F-35; and as well as mobility, C-130J.","In terms of oil prices, we're really not seeing a pullback on expenditures for oil prices because, frankly, these countries are looking to meet their essential national security needs. And many of them have deep reserves, countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the UAE and others. And really, they're not \u2013 we don't see them pulling back at all on what they need to do in terms of purchasing their missile defense, their fighters.","And now I think you probably have seen that Saudi is doing their naval expansion program where they've already committed to purchasing MH-60 Romeo helicopters. And now, there is a process underway with the LCS being \u2013 there is a positive momentum on their acquisition of the LCS. They have now the congressional notification for them to purchase up to four littoral combat ships for their multi-mission surface combatant. And so, we stand ready to support that sale because what they're interested in is a freedom-class LCS experience that we produce, which could \u2013 we could potentially get under contract sometime next year.","We're making great progress. We achieved 20% international sales. We're now on a path to 25% of international sales. We have \u2013 for 2014, we had about $20 billion in international in our backlog, so we continue to see a strong pull for our portfolio internationally. And as I travel around the world, I just returned from the Middle East and there continue to be a strong demand.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Peter, you asked about just some of the larger maybe international pursuits in 2016 that we're looking to accomplish. Probably first and foremost, that is a THAAD sale to Qatar. This has been in discussions for quite some time and it's ongoing quite frankly, but we think that ultimately it will close in 2016.","Marillyn just mentioned littoral combat ship as part of the SNEP program in Saudi Arabia. We'll see if that's able to close in 2016, but I think the prospects just got better with the congressional notification that we saw yesterday. There's numerous F-35 international buys sort of all co-mingled within the LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 contracts that we're negotiating there. But those do contain significant quantities of international customers.","And then maybe just to finalize the thought there, we expect to have some modification, at least one fairly good-sized modification program on F-16s and we haven't given up on selling new F-16s to at least a couple of different prospects. And we're hopeful we can get at least one of those deals closed in 2016. So that's four, probably more than that if you include the multiple numerous customers with an F-35. Those are some of the larger ones next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. On international sales, when I look at Missiles and Fire Control, I think of that as a unit that's a lot of drive from international sales and it's PAC-3, THAAD, different missile programs. But if you look over the last several years, backlogs have been pretty flat.","Now, I know you've had some pullback on the services side and backlogs were a little bit better \u2013 got better this quarter. But can you reconcile the fact that we should be seeing a lot of international demand for these programs, yet so far we really haven't seen it reflected in a big increase in backlogs there?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, Doug, I'll try to answer that. I think the biggest reason that you don't see that is, one, we've seen some delays in negotiations. As I said, we just now finished actually negotiating here \u2013 I say just now, here recently we just finished negotiating both the FY 2014 and FY 2015 Patriot deals, the factory deals.","Those orders, when they're finalized, are pretty good-sized. We typically don't see at Missiles and Fire Controls the sort of multi-year orders like you might associate with the aircraft programs at aeronautics. They tend to be individual fiscal year buys.","So because we don't sort of reach forward and get multiple fiscal years in a combined buy, you don't see the increases in backlog that you might experience with Missiles and Fire Control. We do expect through \u2013 as you look at the year 2015, we do expect to end the year at higher levels of backlog than we began the year for Missiles and Fire Control by as much as about $1.5 billion.","So it's not like it's shrinking. It is growing. It's growing at a clip. But it's not growing leaps and bounds like you would expect to see with a large multiyear program. That's simply not the way those products are typically being bought.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just want to ask a couple of things on F-35. Since you're still negotiating LRIP 9, how much margin risk is there, given the work that's already been done that you referred to earlier? And then, Marillyn, you talked about the full year, the effect of a full-year CR and how debilitating that would be. But it would be largely a backlog issue in 2016. Are we referring to the slippage of \u2013 I think it's 19 F-35s? And at what point will we see that in the P&L, and how would that affect just the production efficiencies?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take on the first one, Rob. The F-35 LRIP 9 negotiation and margin risk if this is not done. Rob, I would characterize this as sort of par for the course, typical. I mean this is what we've been going through with F-35 for quite some time.","I'll say that the numbers that we talk about for 2016, because there's so little impact of LRIP 9 affecting the P&L in 2016, I wouldn't expect to see a huge swing no matter sort of what we negotiated margin-wise on LRIP 9. And maybe I'll let Marillyn answer the broader CR question, but you asked a specific one about 19 aircraft on the F-35, if there is sort of a full-year continuing resolution. I think that number is about right. That's the number that the Pentagon has talked about.","Again, we wouldn't expect to see much of an impact of that affecting 2016. You would start to see that pick up steam in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. I'll remind you we do record revenue and earnings on a cost-to-cost basis as opposed to units of delivery. So, those 19 aircraft would stop having less growth than we had expected to have happen, but not much in 2016. It would start happening in 2017 and beyond.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you pretty well answered him, Bruce...","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Sam.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the Space Systems segment, just what drove the better-than-expected sales and earnings? Does this change your view towards how strategic it is to maintain your ULA joint venture? And if I can sneak a second one in, Bruce, can you just tell us is CapEx mostly flat year-over-year as we look at the 2016 free cash? Thanks.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll try that, Sam. So, third quarter Space was actually down about 5% in the quarter. We should think of that \u2013 we had a commercial launch last year and none this year. That was probably the biggest driver for the reduction. There's a lot of pieces sort of moving around, but that wasn't the biggest reason for the delta.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was thinking more in terms of the year getting better more than...","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, the year, I'm sorry, for the full year. Yeah, so, we've had \u2013 the overall year performance had been very good. We've had extremely good performance on our government satellite contracts, and we actually have had some upticks from an EBIT perspective as well with the F-35 \u2013 from the ULA joint venture that your next question asked about.","So sort of the combined. We're seeing really, really good performance out of Space Systems on their legacy programs. Think of it as the satellite programs like SBIRS and Advanced EHF. But also on the launch vehicle business with ULA, we're seeing some more equity earnings there.","As to the other question on the ULA JV, we haven't decided anything differently about the ULA JV despite what's in the press, Sam, so I'm not going to comment on that at this point in time. And then I think your last question was on CapEx for next year and how we should think of that.","You should think of that as being essentially comparable to this year's level, maybe a little bit higher. But I'll tell you every year, as we look out to the next year, people think we're going to spend more in CapEx, and we tend to not do that as we go throughout the year. So, for right now, I'll just say probably pretty comparable to this year's level.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to ask about the plan \u2013 the strategic review, your ability to conclude the strategic review and make a decision about what to do with those businesses, how much is that contingent upon a budget outcome, just having a budget outcome, and then on any particular budget outcome?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, Seth, I don't think we see much dependency whatsoever on a budget outcome. I don't \u2013 and again, I'll just go back to \u2013 if you look at this business and what the projections are for this business, they're sort of unaffected by the budget outcome in terms of continuing resolution and the like because again continuing resolution would put a hindrance on new starts, programs that are growing fiscal year over fiscal year. We don't have a whole lot of that in this business. And I wouldn't expect that to have much of an impact as far as deciding what to do with the businesses on a strategic review as a result of that.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would just to add to that that we are getting strong expressions of interest from a lot of different parties ranging from strategic buyers to non-strategic buyers. And I think that makes the point that these are high quality assets and it's a very strong business portfolio. So it just reaffirms our belief that this is the kind of business that would benefit from a lower cost structure outside of Lockheed Martin. And we feel very strongly that we'll be able to come to a conclusion by the end of the year on what the path forward is for that element of our business to make it more competitive and stronger in the marketplace.","Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations","Karen, I think we're coming up on the hour. Maybe I'll \u2013 one last question and we'll turn it over to Marillyn for final comments.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Bruce, maybe looking to get a little bit of help in terms of how we model things on a go-forward basis. With the outcome of whatever you decide to do with government IT and PS, there will be a fair amount of dilution. Depending on which route you choose and the cash that comes in, would you expect to be able to fairly quickly offset a fair amount of the dilution from potentially selling those businesses or just in terms of how we're modeling this going forward, how should we think about it?","Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So there's a lot of \u2013 depending on the structure, David, there's a lot of just moving pieces that try to predict the outcome there. You should think of a spin as essentially a left pocket, right pocket to our shareholders, right, because the value of the business under a spin would simply be held by the same shareholders that hold Lockheed Martin stock today. So total effect on shareholders is not \u2013 should be inconsequential in that view.","I understand the dilution if you look at the after-Lockheed Martin, but there is a lot of moving pieces that could affect that. Obviously, the amount of cash that we get back, whether it's a sale, obviously we get back a lot more cash. Whether it's a split or not as part of the spin\/merge, there's a lot of different moving pieces there that are just at this point hard to predict.","We'll have, I think, a whole lot more fidelity and a whole lot better insight on that when we finally reach a final decision of the outcome or the path for the outcome in December. And again, we're going to communicate that to you just as soon as we get there.","Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So let me just conclude the call today. I want to end by reiterating that the corporation had another solid quarter and we continue to be well-positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and to our stockholders.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to have you joining us as we review our second quarter results, some key operational accomplishments from across our Company and celebrate a very noteworthy milestone.","Before I begin I want to offer my appreciation and congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their continuing dedication in the achievement of strong second quarter financial results as we continue to focus the organization on long term growth and value creation. The corporation continues to deliver innovative capabilities to our customers while also returning value to our stockholders and I am very proud of our Lockheed Martin team.","As today's release detailed, we have a very strong quarter and continue to develop excellent financial results \u2013 I'm sorry continue to deliver excellent financial results. And we will review these results in depth a little later on the call.","I'm very pleased that our strong financial performance across the corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2018 have enabled us to increase our full year outlook for sale, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Our second quarter and year-to-date financial performance and increased full year projection for all financial metrics are the result of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of offerings as each of our four business areas were able to contribute to our improved financial outlook.","I will cover some performance highlights from our business areas in just a moment, but I want to begin by recognizing a very special milestone that occurred this quarter. June 17 marked the 75th anniversary of the founding our Skunk Works organization. In 1943, the U.S. Army expressed its urgent need for a jet fighter to counter the rapidly growing German aerial threat and Clarence Kelly Johnson and his team of dedicated engineers began the Skunk Works legacy. In just 143 days, this energetic group of aerospace innovators designed and built the XP-80 fighter aircraft helping to usher in the jet age of U.S. aviation.","Over the past three quarters of a century, the Skunk Works has produced the advanced technology that leads some of the most recognizable breakthrough products in our industry including the U2 Dragon Lady spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, the fastest plane to ever fly and the F-117 Nighthawk, the world's first stealth fighter and precursor to today's F-22 and F-35, which were also developed at the Skunk Works.","The Skunk Works has become an industry standard for innovation and is a vital incubator for current technologies such as quiet supersonic flight, hypersonics, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and advanced unmanned aerial platforms, key providers of growth opportunities in the future.","History has shown that this unique organization has the unparalleled capacity to produce new solutions to complex problems. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works remains focused on a commitment to innovation born 75 years ago and we look forward to continuing this rich heritage for another 75 years and beyond.","Turning briefly to the Department of Defense budget, you'll recall that in the first quarter Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 which raised the defense budget caps for both 2018 and 2019. Fiscal year 2019 based DoD budgets will build upon the significant growth included in the FY 2018 appropriations with an additional $17 billion on top of the greater than $70 billion dollar increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018. Both the House and Senate fiscal year 2019 appropriation bills have successfully cleared their respective committees. Once the FY 2019 Defense Appropriation Bill passes the Senate floor later this summer, the two chambers will commence the conference process. While each bill has met the total legislated target for the DoD budget caps, both committees have put forth recommended funding in excess of the original presidential budget request for a number of our programs including 12 to 16 additional F-35 jets, up to 14 additional THAAD interceptors, 8 additional C-130J aircraft, 8 to 15 Blackhawk helicopters and 1 to 2 additional Littoral Combat Ships. These increases are above the additional funding and active in the FY 2018 on the [indiscernible] appropriations of which over $7 billion [were for] [ph] Lockheed Martin programs.","These FY 2019 increases will still need to be settled in conference and the agree-to-appropriations bill must be signed into law. However, we are very encouraged by the support of our portfolio has continued to receive as the budget process progresses.","Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant milestones we achieved across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program. We saw four significant events take place in this quarter. In June, the United Kingdom welcomed its first four F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing jets to its shores as the U.K. prepares for its lightning force and mission operating capability by the end of this year.","The STOVL aircraft will be used by both the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy and we're proud to deliver these planes as the RAF celebrates its one hundredth anniversary.","Also in June, we were honored to host the roll out ceremony to mark the first two F-35 deliveries to Turkey at our Fort Worth Texas facility. Turkey has been a long standing member of the F-35 program joining in 1999 at its inception. The two F-35 jets will initially be stationed at Luke Air Force Base and will take part in a pilot training program.","In May, the Israeli Air Force announced their F-35 Adir aircraft have been used in operational combat, marking the first time this fifth generation stealth fighter has been deployed into a contested environment. In this quarter, we made our three hundredth F-35 delivery as the U.S. Air Force received its latest conventional takeoff and landing variant at Hill Air Force Base. We've now delivered 305 production aircraft in total, demonstrating the program's continued progress and momentum. We anticipate delivering 91 Joint Strike Fighters in 2018 as we ramp towards full rate production.","These four important milestones underscore the strong support both the U.S. forces and the international community have shown for this transformational aircraft.","I'll close our aeronautics discussion by noting how pleased we were with the Slovakian Defense Ministry\u2019s announcement this morning that they have selected our F-16 to replace its current fleet of fighters with 14 state-of-the-art block 70 aircraft planned to be ordered. The State Department has already approved the sale and we will now move to finalize the agreement which we expect will exceed $1 billion.","We are excited by the opportunity to add Slovakian jets to our recent Bahrain order as we look to extend our new Greenville F-16 production line for years to come.","Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, we saw significant demand for our tactical missile products this quarter as well as continued support in air and missile defense. Our guided multiple launch rocket system, GMLRS team received a not-to-exceed award of approximately $820 million dollars for Lot 13 production and delivery of precision strike weapon systems for the U.S. Army.","We also received an award of over $360 million for Army Tactical Missile System or ATACMS missiles. This program will allow the military system to upgrade their existing ATACMS missiles with new technology and double their range, while extending their shelf life by more than 10 years. Also in our Air and Missile Defense Organization, our PAC-3 team received a pair of awards to produce additional interceptors for the U.S. Army and foreign military sales customers with a potential value in excess of a $0.5 billion.","Before moving on, I'd like to acknowledge the Tactical Missile team's successful dual test event launching a pair of long range anti-ship missiles or LRASM precision guided missile from a U.S. Air Force B-1B lancer bomber. The missiles positively identified their maritime target and delivered a successful impact. This is the second successful dual LRASM flight test as the team progresses towards early operational capability on B1B aircraft later this year demonstrating our ability to rapidly deliver crucial capabilities to our war fighters.","In the Rotary and Mission Systems business area, we saw two historic achievements for CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter. In April, the CH-53K made its international debut at the ILA Berlin Air Show and flew for the first time outside of the United States.","Using its modern design and fly-by-wire technology, the heavy lift 53-K demonstrated its unique capabilities. It was remarkable to see a rugged aircraft of this power and cargo weight carrying capacity exhibit such maneuverability.","In May, we delivered the first of our anticipating 200 production King Stallions to the U.S. Marine corps. The helicopter now enters into the supportability test plan where the Marines will conduct logistics and maintenance evaluations to ensure readiness and support on the flight line when the CH-53K enters into service with the corps. We currently have an additional 18 aircraft in various stages of production as the program continues to mature and grow.","As part of our continuing focus on affordability and our ongoing commitment to maintaining efficient operations, we made the difficult decision this quarter to eliminate certain positions and restructure part of the Rotary and Mission Systems organization which resulted in a $0.26 charge to earnings per share.","The majority of this action is related to our Sikorsky line of business as we complete the integration activities we began several years ago and work to ensure the organization is properly sized to meet customer requirements and growth objectives. We believe this will benefit our customers help position the RMS business area and the corporation for improved competitiveness and create additional long term value for stockholders.","I'll close with our space business area which celebrated two important milestones this quarter. In May, the fourth Space Based Infrared System or SBIRS GEO Flight-4 satellite achieved first flight as it turned on its powerful sensors for the first time and began transmitting images back to Earth. SBIRS GEO-4 is the latest satellite to join the Air Force's orbiting missile warning system and it completes the baseline SBIRS constellation providing global coverage and increased accuracy to detect an even greater number of targets. We are proud to be able to provide this key component of the nation's Air and Missile Defense System and look forward to continuing this rich legacy with the future completion of SBIRS 5 and 6 and beyond.","Our space business area continued its leadership in research and space exploration with the successful launch of the Lockheed Martin designed and built NASA Mars InSight Lander. The InSight spacecraft was launched aboard a ULA Atlas V rocket this past May and is scheduled to arrive in November of this year. After its 6 months journey to the Red Planet, the InSight robotic explorer will begin its mission of studying the interior composition of the planet's core by analyzing the structure of the core and crust and measuring the rate of internal seismic activity. The data provided by this mission will help scientist better understand the geologic evolution of Mars as well as all terrestrial planets including Earth.","Our corporation has built Landers for Mars research programs since NASA's first Viking mission in the 1970s and we've been a part of every NASA mission to Mars. We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft and we are excited to continue our Mars heritage with the InSight program.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance and discuss our updated outlook for 2018. We will then open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks Marillyn and good morning, everyone. As I highlight, our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let's begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. In short, we exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the quarter building upon the strong results from the first quarter. Sales and segment operating profit and cash from operations excluding our pension contribution were particularly strong. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion dollars in cash from operations before making $2 billion in contributions to our pension trust that we accelerated to preserve the 35% tax deduction as we have previously discussed. This contribution will turn cash for the quarter slightly negative however was much better than we projected when we last spoke in April.","Our accelerated contributions will end next quarter as we make the final $1.5 billion of our planned $5 billion in pension outlays for the year. We returned almost $900 million dollars to our stockholders again this quarter, nearly $600 million through dividends and more than $300 million through share repurchases reducing share count by a million shares and we increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're very pleased with our results for the first half of the year.","On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew almost 7% over the same quarter last year driven by a combination of three factors. First, higher than planned win rates on new programs. Second, earlier than planned awards. And third, several unplanned awards associated with the Omnibus budget increases announced last quarter some of which are expected to convert into increased sales quicker under the new revenue recognition methodology.","Missiles and Fire Control had the highest growth in the quarter at almost 17% driven by classified business, volume in our air missile defense line of business and increases in sensor and tactical missile sales.","Aeronautics grew 8% in the quarter, due primarily to increased F-35 production volume while RMS grew more than 4%, due to higher volume on radar programs and a number of programs in our integrated warfare systems and sensor line of business. These increases more than offset lower volume at Sikorsky due to lower Black Hawk volume which itself was lower was partially offset by higher CH-53K volume. Space\u2019s sales in the quarter were essentially flat compared with last year second quarter results.","Segment operating profit was up almost 9% in the quarter compared with last year\u2019s results. RMS again had the highest operating profit improvement this quarter with a 26% increase, driven by higher sales volume and improved performance across most of the portfolio including Sikorsky, where we\u2019re seeing better performance on the Multi-Year IX contract for Black Hawk helicopters along with cost reduction activities across Sikorsky that are more than offsetting the lower billed rate volume of Multi-Year IX versus Multi-Year VIII.","I\u2019ll point out of the results for RMS exclude $96 million in severance and restructuring charges that are recognized as unallocated corporate expense in accordance with our practice for charges this large. These charges better position us to be more cost competitive both in the current market environment and going forward.","Missiles and Fire Control had the next highest level of profit growth at 10% with higher volume resulting from the sales increase and improved performance across the portfolio more than offsetting a provision we established for performance on an international combat vehicle.","Space grew over 7% driven by higher risk retirements in fleet ballistic missiles and lower provisions for performance in commercial satellites. Aeronautics profit grew 1% in the quarter with improved performance on F-35 production and sustainment contracts more than offsetting a significant risk retirement on the C-5 program that occurred last year.","Turning to Chart 5, we\u2019ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $4.05 was $0.77 higher than our results last year, driven by the higher segment operating profit results and a lower tax rate in the quarter compared with last year. The $4.05 EPS in the quarter includes the $0.26 charge for severance and restructuring activity that I mentioned earlier.","On Chart 6, we provide a revised outlook for the year. We are increasing our outlook for sales by $1.25 billion and our segment operating profit outlook by $260 million as a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year and our expectations that we will continue to see strong performance in the second half as well. We\u2019re also increasing our EPS and cash from operations outlooks and will discuss each of those increases in the next few charts.","Chart 7 provides our sales guidance by business area for the year. We\u2019re increasing our sales outlook for all four business areas with RMS representing the largest increase at $400 million, Space next with a $350 million increase and both Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control increasing by $250 million each to account for the $1.25 billion increase overall.","Chart 8 shows our new segment \u2013 excuse me, our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $260 million with RMS also having the largest profit increase among the business areas at $120 million, Missiles and Fire Control next with an $80 million increase, and space and Aeronautics increasing $35 million and $25 million respectively.","Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.72 increase in our EPS. The severance and restructuring charge mentioned earlier reduces EPS by $0.26 and a lower projected tax rate along with several miscellaneous impacts improved our EPS by $0.49 with most of that change resulting from expectations of a lower tax rate in 2018 as we continue to incorporate refinements and implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted last year.","Chart 10 provides an update to our long term cash from operations outlook. Given the increase in our outlook for 2018 cash from operations, we now see our updated three year cash goal to be equal to or greater than $17.3 billion with the increase in 2018 representing an overall increase in our three year expectations rather than a pull forward from future years.","And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We\u2019ve had a very strong first half of 2018 allowing us to increase our outlook for all key financial measures for the full-year. And as a reminder, we\u2019ll be providing our trend information for 2019 during the upcoming October call.","With that we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Bruce Tanner","Carter, are you there, you\u2019re mute.","Carter Copeland","I am indeed on mute. Thank you very much. Good morning and good results guys.","Bruce Tanner","Thank you.","Carter Copeland","Just I wonder if you could give a little bit more color Bruce on the charge in MFC on the warrior capability sustainment just, what were you encountered there and in the ring fencing of that anything you can tell us about that to just keep in mind?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Thanks for the comments and the question, Carter. So we\u2019ve been working on the Warriors is the Warrior capability sustainment program and essentially it\u2019s taking a legacy armored combat vehicle putting a new turret on it some new electronics, some new cannon essentially for our intents and purposes coming up with a new combat vehicle. And it is \u2013 as a fairly significant amount of developmental effort on it to make sure that turret operates well, make sure the cannon fires at speed and the like.","So it had some issues obviously with the development aspects of this. We think we have that quantified as a result of this charge. There\u2019s a follow-on production effort that results from this development contract to essentially modify a number of these vehicles in the service for the U.K. Army and that\u2019s the expectation Carter is that this will come to satisfactory conclusion on the development side and will move into production and hopefully put this behind us.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yeah, thanks. Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Hey Bruce, maybe just given the higher sales guidance if you could be, is there any way to bracket it that you view that you said higher win rates in earlier planned wins, so how do we think of that in the context of when you\u2019re going to give that 2019 trend information in terms of the sales profile? Is there this a pull forward or is just the timing of the awards? Any color there would to helpful.","Bruce Tanner","Look I think as I said in the in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve had more success from a win rates perspective and you should think of us we always sort of go into the year with sort of high expectations for ourselves but you don\u2019t win every single competition out there, but we probably win I don\u2019t know 65%, 70% of the competitions we enter thinking we\u2019re going to win most of them, and that\u2019s typically the case.","Here we\u2019ve actually experienced a higher rate than that particularly in Missiles and Fire Control but not exclusively Missile and Fire Control. And as I said in the remarks earlier, some of those awards we\u2019ve gotten into the point where the habit perhaps of just expecting things to get delayed for things like protests and the like and we haven\u2019t seen that happen to delay award recognition as much as maybe we\u2019ve had seen as historically as well. So those two are both goodness those two are both a little bit of increase for the year, but also increase in future years if you think about higher win rate. And then the Omnibus activities in the awards we\u2019re receiving here, I mean the surprise is maybe how much of that is already getting put under contract for 2018 and resulting in the sales recognition that we talked about earlier and this is again because of the revenue recognition methodology essentially recognize and as we starting incurring cost. But that\u2019s almost pure upper to our expectations for the out years, so my expectation Peter would be this is not a pull forward, this is an upper for both to 2018 and future years as well.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Hey, good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Rob.","Robert Spingarn","I wanted to ask you about aeronautics margins and the implied guidance remain fairly steady I guess in around 10.6 for the remainder of the year. But you look to be making good progress toward a definitized contract on LRIP 11. So what I was wondering is, is it possible that contract once it\u2019s done generates some positive EACs there\u2019s upside to the back end of the year in Aeronautics on F-35 or does it not actually impact the booking rate?","Bruce Tanner","Rob, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and Marillyn can jump in the some comments if she has some. So I think we are making progress, you\u2019re probably seen some of the press that came out on LRIP 11 there. I think we\u2019re in the final throws of that if you will. I wouldn\u2019t expect LRIP 11 to have huge consequential impacts from a margin perspective on the rest of 2018 quite honestly, primarily because it\u2019s not the bulk of the activity if you will in 2018 previous contracts are the bulk and we typically have most of our risk retirements and step ups associated sort of contracts I\u2019ll say further along than we expect to be on LRIP 11 throughout the rest of 2018. We do expect the continued good performance on the rest of the F-35 portfolio and we\u2019re optimistic or at least we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019s an opportunity to continue to see that kind of performance in the second half of the year but we\u2019re not counting on it at this point, Rob.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah. Thanks very much. Bruce, just on the guidance increase, you took this year\u2019s cash from ops guidance but left 2019 and 2020 at the same. Can you just speak to why that is? Thank you.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, so Joe, hopefully it\u2019s a simple answer to the question. We just haven\u2019t updated our planning information for 2019 and 2020. And the only reason that we increase the three year total is because of what happened 2018 obviously the $300 million increase. So similar to the question that Peter was asking relative there is the positive impact we\u2019re seeing in 2018 translate into 2019 and beyond that. And I think the answer to that is yes. And I hope to give you inside into at least the 2019 portion of that when we talk in the October call to give trend information there but my expectation is a lot of the goodness we\u2019re seeing in 2018 for the rest of this year is going to continue to translate into 2019 and beyond.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hi, Bruce, good morning. Just want to follow-up on that point. I think previously you talked about on the growth side as well 4% to 5% 2019 and 2020, just sort of put a button on this, where do expect acceleration beyond 2018 to speak from everything you\u2019re seeing in terms of win rates and budget because I think this year you are already kind of in that range now?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, Jon, the question is, do we expect an increase over the sort of the increases that we\u2019ve previously talked about for years 2019 and 2020. The answer is yes. And again my only hesitation of telling you that is that I don\u2019t quite yet have the quantification of that but my expectation based on everything we\u2019ve seen through this year and everything we expect to happen going forward is that those numbers will be higher than what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And again I\u2019ll give you more inside into that hopefully quite a bit of inside into that in October.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could just address something quickly which is you mentioned a lower tax rate is only if you could just say what the tax you expect for this year? And then secondly in the Rotary and Mission Systems, if I just look at the overall guidance even with the higher sales and profit for this year would imply the second half margin has to come down pretty materially from the first half, so something unusual about the first half, is there a change in mix, can you just help us understand what\u2019s happening in the second half there?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. I think that one as well Sam. And so tax rate in 2018 you should probably think of mid-14ish kind of level is what we\u2019re out looking for the rest of the year 218. That\u2019s probably a little bit lower than what you just expect us to do going forward say in the years 2019 and 2020. There\u2019s sort of some onetime adjustments. I\u2019ll give you one example, one of the adjustments where the update the deferred tax asset write down that occurred in 2017 just some true up to that that actually got reflected in our 2018 tax expense that we would not expect to carry over into 2019 and beyond. So again this year, think about mid-14s probably a little higher than that as we go forward into 2019 and 2020.","On the RMS side, you\u2019re right, I mean the math would say that we are going to come down some of that [Technical Difficulty] I think that reflects, we\u2019ve had some really, really strong performance in the first half of the year and a lot of risk retirements pretty much across the entire portfolio as I talked about in my prepared remarks for RMS, I mean virtually every line of business, plus we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s happened in Sikorsky for the first half of the year. And I think Sam it\u2019s just a question of whether or not we can sort of replicate the higher than I\u2019ll say expected level of risk retirements that occurred in the first half and the second half. And at least as we\u2019re planning right now, we don\u2019t see the same level of planned risk retirements going forward as what we experienced in the in the first half, but we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to try to improve up on that just as we did in the first half of the year, so watch the space.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you. I wanted to go back to F-35, and two things. One is, you know now that your peers getting close on LRIP 11 looking toward a block buy. Can you talk about given the pressure coming from the customer on pricing, how are you looking at margins going forward, how should we think of that trajectory over the next few years?","And then second, just the point on Turkey, there was an agreement in Congress yesterday I don\u2019t know where this is going to go and blocking the delivery to Turkey. What would a block on the Turkish deliveries? What effect could that have on the supply chain in your delivery rates?","Bruce Tanner","So, I\u2019ll park the first and maybe a little bit of a second one and I probably turn that over a little bit to Marillyn on the second question. So LRIP 11, as we talked about on previous questions, I think we\u2019re in the final close of that and that hopefully sets the stage for as you indicated the next big accomplishment on F-35 which is to get the block buy sort of in place. This would be a combination of think of it as combining our supply chain buys for LRIPs 12, 13 and 14 all in one sort of a hence the name block buy deal to get cost savings associated with that aggregated demand.","Doug, I think to your question, we\u2019ve seen good performance on the F-35. I\u2019ve talked about the fact that we do expect to see sequential improvement on F-35 margins going forward, that be probably not at the same rate as a few years past, you know there were a couple years there were at least I had said that we were expecting a 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. Don\u2019t see those sorts of improvements but that expectation is that we still will see improvements on F-35 going forward. And I\u2019ll say this LRIP 11 deal doesn\u2019t change that trajectory or our expectation of those margins going forward.","As to the Turkish deliveries and supply chain implications, we\u2019re delivering, we would expect to continue to deliver Turkish aircraft as with essentially every international procurer of F-35 is the initial deliveries of F-35 is actually stay in the continental United States for training purposes. So the international pilots typically stay in the United States to get a level of proficiency to be able to fly the aircraft before they\u2019re sort of shipped overseas. So we\u2019ve got some time before those aircraft would leave the U.S. and go in country. That is normal standard practice for every international buy. And I guess my expectations would be we continue to deliver those and continue deliver those into our U.S. bases for training purposes. This is a contract that obviously this is one that we have the agreement. This is under the FMS the foreign military sales arrange but this is a contract between Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government as opposed to direct commercial sales, so we\u2019ll continue to deliver air craft until the U.S. government says don\u2019t deliver those aircraft which we\u2019re not expecting.","Marillyn Hewson","So on supply chain front, I will address that. As we manage our supply chain, we do have parts and components being produced all around the world, so we\u2019re always looking at international dynamics of that. The most recent discussion that you\u2019re hearing on Turkey, we\u2019ve been looking at that and been in discussions with the most senior levels of the Pentagon. We understand what impact that would be on the supply chain. And so we\u2019ll book comply as Bruce said and support the U.S. government and comply to any official guidance that we get going forward.","But if we look at the program itself, I mean it\u2019s got some range of time before we actually have some action and frankly with the vast Department of Defense to do is come back with a plan in 90 days. So we see what that plan is going forward and will continue to be in close dialogue with the U.S. government.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Safran","Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning. How are you?","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Richard Safran","So I have a bit of a multipart question here related to F-35 modernization. You recently awarded the Distributed Aperture System to Raytheon, you took away from Northrop, Elbit won the display taking it away from L-3 not too long ago. I want to know if you could discuss how you\u2019re thinking about further upgrade to the F-35. How much more of the airplane might be replaced and up for bid. Do the changes you\u2019re making just come in one future version of the airplane or is it expected that you\u2019ll retrofit the fleet over time? And finally, since it appears that these are both capability and cost improvements, just wondering if we should expect Lockheed to capture at least part of that cost improvement in our margins?","Marillyn Hewson","That\u2019s a multifaceted question, Rich, thanks very much for the question. I\u2019ll start and then Bruce can fill in as well and how we see that for the longer term. But basically this is our job as managing the program itself and so we reached a point along the way of gotten through now flight test program, we are now more mature and technically mature aircraft program. And as we go to look at the next lot of aircraft, we look at having competitions for best value on components that we can do. And so some of those you sided with the distributed system and then displayed and others are just a normal course on a production program that we\u2019ll look at and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","As we look overtime, just like any other program we will constantly be looking at continuous improvement of the program and that will open up some opportunities for additional development. But I think that answers that. Bruce you might want to address the cost side of it.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So Rich, I think another part of your question was retrofit fleet, so incorporated this. That\u2019s not our call that\u2019s obviously the JPOs call is to why not they want to do that. If you\u2019re asking my expectation, I\u2019d say I wouldn\u2019t expect a near term retrofit at all. My guess would be we\u2019d go downstream and see if there is a chance to do other modifications to it to the aircraft and do this in combination with other modifications as opposed to sort of start replacing the existing aircraft with this new or this new processor and our processor in the display system. So probably more in the normal course of business as opposed to a full blown retrofit is sort of the way I\u2019d characterize it.","And I think your last question was capability to increase margins associated with this and we just say I think your premise is right. We do expect these changes to be lower costs, lower sustainment cost importantly going forward, so this is sort of a double benefit, it lowers the production cost of the aircraft, it also lowers the sustainment cost to keep those aircraft flying. We\u2019re banking on that Rick and you should think of as we\u2019re pricing it under those assumptions. So we wouldn\u2019t expect to have sort of pop in margin associated with this activity because we\u2019re pricing it out of the expectation that the benefits that we expect to see will impact the crew in this case to the U.S. government.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So your backlog at mid-year is relatively in line with where it was at year-end. Can you give us a range as to where you expect it might be by the end of this year and some color on the foreign sales opportunities included there?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, Cai. I will take a poke at that. You\u2019re right where [Technical Difficulty] $5 billion or about $105 billion now. We would expect to be north of that maybe between $7 million to $10 million \u2013 excuse billion dollars some of that obviously depended on some of the second half of the year awards. The big chunk of that that we are expecting a large third quarter from an order perspective the largest piece of that is obviously for the F-35 block buy. You should think of that is I don\u2019t know exactly what that is somewhere in the $11-ish billion plus range. So that\u2019s a very significant single order that we are expecting in the second half of the year. We also have some awards for things like that for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we have a couple of competitions obviously with the trainer replacement for the Air Force and MQ-25 for the Navy. So some of those competitions could obviously swing backlog between now and the new year obviously depending on whether or not we\u2019re success or the size of the initial award. But in any event we would expect to see as probably north of $110 billion as we get to year-end.","Cai von Rumohr","Great. Thank you very much.","Bruce Tanner","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Hey, good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hey, Ron.","Ron Epstein","This is a question for maybe both of you guys. When you look at the U.K. recent announcement of the sixth generation fighter program concept whatever you call the tempest program? And that kind of more recently Airbus is moved to say, hey what maybe we should join forces on a fighter and have a pan-European sixth generation fighter. When you think a little bit longer term about the target market maybe beyond F-35, I mean how does that impact you guys and I mean how do we think about sixth gen fighter in Lockheed?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, I just came from Riyadh and Farnborough where that announcement was made by the U.K. about the new Tempest fighter program and I had a chance to talk to some of the senior leadership in the Royal Air Force about it. You the comments to me where that, yes this is a new fighter program that they are focused on but it is to complement the F-35. So we don\u2019t see it as a replacement for the F-35, I mean it\u2019s going to take some time to do a development program beyond that.","And so any additional investment that they make of course that\u2019s good for the engineering base for innovation in an aerospace and defense industry and we\u2019re in discussions with them and trying to learn more about how we can help and supporting what their plans are in the U.K. Just as you might have hear they say that they\u2019d like to participate in that. I think we bring as I highlight in my earlier remarks some just tremendous capability from innovation standpoint particularly out of some Skunk Works organization and we\u2019re looking forward to that.","The U.K. is solid with the F-35. I mean they were original investors putting $2 billion up front in the development phase. Today they\u2019ve gone 15 jets and they\u2019re still on their path for the 138 program of the record that they\u2019re going to buy. So I don\u2019t see an impact on the F-35 going forward, it brings a lot of transformational capabilities. My understanding from them is that they just see it as continuing to keep their engineering based focused on the next design just the U.S. government will do as we look at concepts that we might put forward on the sixth generation fighter.","Anything Bruce you want to add?","Bruce Tanner","You know I might add Marillyn is I think as Marillyn said I think this is complimentary to the F-35 and also sort of that I guess the typhoon that we said on replacement. And I think into large extent this is healthy to have our allies developing capabilities that actually we can actually potentially partner with and share those capabilities cross across the ocean so to speak on future opportunities. So this is a positive that the industries of our partner countries that are allied participants are staying in the game with next generation innovations, so those are the positive thing.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good morning. Marillyn and Bruce. Great quarter.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Thank you.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","A bit of a less exciting question, I was wondering if you could touch upon pension and some of the longer term drivers, is there any way to have quantified pension contributions and cap recoveries in 2021 and beyond?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, Sheila, I will take one. So I hope I\u2019ll get a little better inside into that in the October call, we\u2019ll have been close obviously by the October call will be what ten almost through ten months of the year from a return perspective on our assets, so we\u2019ll have a better indication of what that looks like versus through the first half of the year what I said here today. As far the biggest driver relative to influencing contributions going forward, again just maybe parrot what I\u2019ve said previously, you should think of essentially zero contributions in 2019, minimal contribution in 2020s is really associate with some of the legacy represented workforce defined benefits plan.","We start making contributions in 2021. I hesitate to give a number right now only because I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to be at the end of this year relative to asset returns. There\u2019s less sensitivity on the cash side, so sort of the billing side if you will and the recovery of cash not the outlay of cash and you should think of that is being fairly close to where we are today. I think we\u2019re at around $2.4 billion of cash today. That number stays fairly consistent almost without regard to what happens over the next few years.","So when you start looking at 2021 and 2022, it\u2019s still about that level maybe $100 million or $200 million plus or minus either way there. But that\u2019s sort of the level you should think about it. So cash pretty consistent, fairs I\u2019ll give you more inside in October once we have a better idea where we\u2019re going to end the year from an asset return perspective.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. That was actually related to the question that I wanted to ask also about pension. Bruce, could you talk a little bit so we can kind of understand conceptually, when you freeze the plan in 2020, is there or is there any more cash, like is pension still allowable costs for you guys is the whatever 401-K matching contributions you make, are those kind of cash or whatever your cash balance that you do receive from the government is at the time you freeze the plan, you just take that in over the next four or five years and then cash kind of goes to zero? And then maybe on the flip side, the contribution side of that, how should we think about what happens when the plan is pros and it gets to be fully funded?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, so good question Seth. So just to repeat what you said, so we do a full freeze on our defined benefit pension plan in 2020. You asked a question, if I understood the question, you asked does that change the liability of recovery of our defined benefit pension contribution and the answer is no. Those cash cost will continue, back to Sheila\u2019s question that they go beyond the freeze if you will of the defined benefit pension plan, but they start to get much smaller particularly as I\u2019m thinking out loud here particularly about the 2025 and later time periods. And think of this is essentially the recovery of a lot of the prepayment credits that we end the year with every year that we disclosed in our 10-Qs and I know I have talked a number of you about that. So somehow that those prepayment credits need to get billed and recovered by Lockheed Martin and those extend beyond the date of the pension freeze. We do have other defined contribution benefits and those are liable just as any other liable cost is in the cost accounting standard regulation.","So sort of no change there going forward. We will recover both from a liable perspective a liability perspective both the remaining defined benefit, pension contributions and new any new defined contribution plan contributions. So we would think \u2013 I think another question that you have was sort of the outlays from the contributions when fully funded, perhaps and it\u2019s still going to take a while to get fully funded. So I think the last I looked it\u2019s still sort of post 2025. I think I said in the past we still expect to have cash recoveries associated with our pension plan in excess of our outlays every single year just about as far out as we can look until we do get fully funded. So I\u2019ll stop there.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Bruce, you have been saying pretty late into May I think that what the company say in the 2018 budget would be pretty unlikely to impact 2018 and was in 2019, 2020 event or maybe even beyond 2020 given the long cycle nature a lot of the business, but you\u2019ve now raise the revenue guidance pretty significantly relative to sizes of other raises you had in the past. And I could I guess I could see if that was happening in something like tactical missiles that can be shorter cycle but it\u2019s super broad based, it\u2019s almost like perfectly we split across the business. So something is evolving like fairly rapidly would seem. I know you mentioned the win rate in the faster awards, but I was hoping you could put a little more meat on the bone there maybe even I don\u2019t know if you could give a few precise program examples, just super curious what was able to change that quickly across the business?","Bruce Tanner","So, I\u2019m not sure how satisfying this is going to be Noah, but I mean I\u2019ll just reiterate what I said on the prepared remarks. But when you go through at least the way we do planning, we have expectations for how many awards we\u2019re going to win in a year. We sometimes while we think we have \u2013 what we think we got to win every reward frankly, we know that\u2019s not realistic. So we kind of put some cushion if you will into our planning purposes for losses that we may or may not \u2013 have a good indication of where those losses might occur. And we also try to face the timing of when awards will occur in the year.","And as I said earlier, we\u2019ve had just a tremendous across the board a year from an orders perspective so far in the first half of the year. And maybe what\u2019s \u2013 maybe not as obvious as I think it maybe it is when you get unexpected awards or higher than planned awards in the first half, on the first part of the year, those have more opportunity to translate into sales under the new revenue recognition methodology, then say an unexpected award you receive in November or December maybe just to state the obvious there.","So the fact that we had higher win rates in the first half of the year on some fairly good sized programs, some in the classified arena, but pretty much across the board. As I said this is a very broad and diversified set of opportunities that we\u2019ve won here. So that\u2019s part of it. And then the other part like I said is we got or we received not just the competitive orders but also a number of sole source orders earlier than we had planned in our planning. So all those times when I was talking to you at the beginning of the year I was just simply referencing this is what our plan looks like and both of these came in either higher than or quicker than we expected or in some cases both of them, we put that plan together.","The Omnibus budget that we talked about and by the way that happened all since of the beginning of the year. That was as I said earlier in the last call that added $7.5 billion of potential orders. And we\u2019re expecting I looked at this data just here, they were expecting the great bulk of that to be placed under contract in 2018. And probably surprise to me as some of that is already under contract today or we\u2019ve been awarded that in the form of long lead funding or UCA funding and that is translating into sales as we speak. So we\u2019re potentially saying several hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue associated with Omnibus funding that was never ever envision as we starter 2018.","And back to the earlier question on, does this translate or carry into the future years. The answer is absolutely yes.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, I was wondering if you could tell us how many more years of growth the F-35 program has? And then also do you still believe you can ultimately get to the mature margins as you\u2019ve seen on programs like the F-16? And if so how much in the future? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","I\u2019ll take and Marillyn can add some color to that as well. So we\u2019ve had this question asked quite a few time as far as the years of growth. I mean you kind of point to what is the current point of record. And I think the current plan of record for the F-35 shows every single year deliveries increased at least out through 2023 and that about as far out as the planning goes. I\u2019ll tell you and I just look at this the other day, we actually have tooling capacity for more than the current plan of records maximum delivery rate. So assuming we\u2019ve got more order, more international customer or increases on domestic orders, there is still some opportunity beyond the current planned peak production rate.","And the George, I think there is ongoing \u2013 the question maybe was how long do we stay at sort of that peak volume, I don\u2019t the answer to that question but if I go back and look at F-16 as maybe an example of what could happen. We were probably at peak production on F-16 for 7 or 10 years. And the thing that F-35 has and the F-16 never had for us is the potential for an increased sustainment activity that we would expect to grow even beyond sort of peak production level. So I think we still got quite a ways to go before see peak F-35 and that doesn\u2019t include potential retrofit and modernization programs on the F-35 as we see with every production aircraft. So we\u2019re not there yet. Now I hope we never see that honestly, but we\u2019re still years away from it and if and when we do see that.","And as far as the margin, I still think there is upside as I said previous George, I still think as I said probably adding some item from day one is probably, there is no reason the F-35 shouldn\u2019t look like every other production aircraft in our history would be at F-16 or C-130s or others where you have mixed domestic content and international content. And if and when we get the ability to see this aircraft on a direct commercial sales basis, the margin approximate what they look like on F-16 programs for incidence back in that timeframe. We\u2019re still probably years away from that but even having said that I still think there is incremental improvement at the current margin level for at least the next couple of years.","Greg Gardner","This is Greg. I think we\u2019ve come up on the top of the hour here, so I\u2019ll turn it back to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Okay, thank you, Greg.

Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Gardner","Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause results to differ materially from those that are in the forward-looking statements.","We have posted charts on our Web site today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today and I hope you have all had a good start to the New Year. Let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the entire Lockheed Martin team for their contributions and commitment throughout 2017. It was through their dedication and efforts that we were able to deliver strong financial results for our stockholders an outstanding operational performance for our customers. Thanks to their focus on mission success, we are well positioned for long-term growth and I am excited by the prospects the future holds. ","2017 was an exceptional year of achievement with strong operational results and new historical high watermarks for sales, orders and cash from operations. We were pleased to see our 2017 sales eclipse $51 billion, representing growth of 8% over 2016 results.","Our 2017 growth was broad-based with each of our four business areas exceeding last year's results. Leading this increase was our aeronautics business area. Fueled by 18% growth in the F-35 program, followed by our missiles and fire control business area, exceeding 2016 sales by 9%, driven by both tactical missiles and air and missile defense products.","We ended 2017 with approximately $100 billion in backlog, the result of our record orders and strong yearly book to bill ratio which have the corporation well positioned for continued growth. I would also like to highlight our performance in driving cash from operations as we generated $1.5 billion in cash during the fourth quarter and $6.5 billion for the year. These results allow us to continue our balance cash deployment strategy as we returned over $4 billion to stockholders through a combination of our commitment to dividends and our share repurchase program.","The corporation also funded a record level of investment in independent research and development and capital expenditure, developing new technologies and positioning the business for future growth. As we noted in today's earnings release, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and will provide long-term benefits for the corporation. In the short term it did result in a onetime non-cash increase to income tax expense that caused our reported earnings to fall below the guidance ranges we communicated in October. We will discuss tax reform in detail later on the call but the impact of this onetime charge does not diminish the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in 2017.","Turning to the Department of Defense of budget, the federal government remains under a continuing resolution or CR for fiscal year 2018 with an extension now in place through the 8th of February. While we are disappointed at the need for the recent extension, there continue to be positive indications of future budget growth despite the current short term CR. First, in December President Trump released the administration's National Security Strategy, a broad overview of global challenges and the over-arching strategies to address them.","Notably, the strategy underscores the need for additional investment in the U.S. military and our country's national defense. This month, the defense department also released its 2018 National Defense Strategy, which reinforces the themes of the National Security Document. Specifically, both strategies highlight the commitment to layered missile defense as well as modernization of our military's weapon systems and readiness with emphasis on nuclear, space, cyber and intelligence capabilities. We believe our portfolio is well aligned to these objectives and we are hopeful appropriations will be enacted which support both the national security and national defense strategies.","Also the Continuing Resolution Bill that the government passed in December, included an additional $4.7 billion over the prior CR for emergency defense funding. Of the $4.7 billion, nearly $4 billion was targeted for missile defense needs, a key element of the National Security Strategy and included request for 50 additional THAAD interceptors and nearly 150 of our PAC-3 MSE missiles. This action represents an increase in missile defense funding of approximately 50% over fiscal year 2017 enacted amounts. A clear recognition of the need for the country to maintain a leadership position in this vital area of national security.","Lastly, in December President Trump signed into law the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA. The bill which was passed by Congress with bipartisan support authorized over $626 billion in base defense spending, as well as $65 billion in overseas contingency operations funds. The NDAA base budget authority would exceed both fiscal year 2017 enacted amounts and the presidential request for FY2018 that was released last spring and would be in excess of the budget control spending caps.","As I have noted before, legislation is still needed to adjust the future spending limits imposed by the budget control act. We are encouraged by recent legislative activity and we continue to urge our lawmakers to work towards an agreement which modifies the budget cap and provides the defense spending required to deliver to our military the resources vital to our national security.","Moving to tax reform. We were pleased to see this important piece of legislation enacted and we believe it will have a positive impact on our corporation and allow American companies to compete more effectively in global pursuit. The new law reduces the combined U.S. corporate tax rate from the highest in the industrialized world, bringing it in line with the tax rates used in the most advanced economies. This will enable us and just as importantly many of our supply chain partners to invest in transformative technologies and make decisions that we anticipate will enhance our competitive position in the 21st century, supporting growth and long-term benefits for customers, employees and stockholders.","We believe this legislation will encourage investment, innovation and job creation across industry. It is important to recognize that the benefit that we will realize in 2018 continue into the future and we are currently exploring options to use these future benefits in ways that will support the growth of our company and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. One immediate and proactive measure our corporation implemented was deciding to accelerate payments into our pension trust in 2018. As a result of this decision, we will contribute $5 billion in cash, satisfying our required pension contributions until 2021.","We are also exploring other investments as a result of the new legislation to enhance our competitive posture and long-term growth potential. Some of these initiatives include increasing our employee training and educational offerings to drive critical skill development, increasing our charitable contributions in science, technology, engineering and maths, or STEM programs, the life blood of our future talent pool, including the creation of a STEM scholarship fund to encourage participation in these important fields of study.","Increasing the Lockheed Martin ventures investment fund that we established over a decade ago, whose charter is to make strategic investments in early stage companies that are developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies in core businesses and new areas that are important to Lockheed Martin. We expect these investments will enable these companies to mature their technologies, grow their businesses and create jobs. Building on our 2017 record investments in capital expenditures and research and development, we will increase our commitment in these areas by a combined $200 million in 20189 as we continue to invest in the assets required to efficiently execute our business as well as the technologies needed to drive long-term growth.","We will continue to assess these and other options with the objective of using the benefits of tax reform to drive growth in our business, attract and retain high performing talent, create new employment opportunities and enhance future cash deployment actions. Moving on, I would like to highlight several operational milestones we achieved across the corporation during the recent few months. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, during the fourth quarter we met our joint government and industry commitment by delivering the 66 aircraft in 2017. This accomplishment represents a 40% increase from the previous year as we continue to ramp up production on this transformational fighter.","We anticipate this momentum continuing into 2018 and now expect to deliver approximately 90 jets this year, an increase of over 35% from 2017 as we continue to progress to full rate production in the next few years. To date, we have delivered over 265 planes to U.S. and international customers. We are excited to see the international community embrace the F-35 with Norway receiving their first three conventional take-off and landing F-35As with the three CTOL variants landing Norwegian soil in November. Israel declaring initial operating capability for their first squadron of CTOL jets and through 2017, seven of our current 11 international customers have accepted the F-35 deliveries and we look forward to working with both existing and potential new buyers to satisfy growing future demand.","Moving to our missiles and fire control business area. Our PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones, including successfully neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets in a complex test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, satisfying a requirement that opens the door to full rate production for our PAC-3 MSE interceptor. Participating in a signing agreement with U.S. and Romanian officials providing Romania the opportunity to upgrade its air defense system by purchasing PAC-3 MSE missiles and receiving an order of over $900 million for PAC-3 missiles for the United States and allied military forces.","In the rotary and mission systems business area, we were pleased to see that the cabinet of Japan agreed to the purchase of two Aegis Ashore batteries which will increase that countries missile defense capabilities and provide greater protection for the Japanese people. The Japan maritime self-defense force currently operates multiple Aegis equipped destroyers and has been a long-term supporter of our Aegis ballistic missile defense technology. The installation of the two land-based Aegis Ashore batteries would supplement the Aegis sea based systems to deliver improved layer missile defense capability, allowing coverage over a wider range with the ability to address a greater number of threats.","While this opportunity remains to be finalized, we were excited by the confidence that the Japanese government continues to show in our Aegis product. Once operational, the Japanese installation will be the third Aegis ashore deployment, adding to those operated by the U.S. in Romania and Poland. Our [quarter] [ph] with our space business area through space based infrared system or SBIRS satellite was delivered to the air force at Cape Canaveral air station in October and was successfully launched in the orbit on a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket just ten days ago, ULA's 125th successful mission since being founded in 2006.","The geo-synchronous earth orbit or geo satellite is the fourth of our six satellite constellation to be deployed and is a key part of our nation's missile defense system. The SBIRS system enhances the military surveillance abilities and expands technical information gathering and situational awareness capability, collected from satellite powerful sensors and converting it into actionable information for defense and intelligence applications. We are extremely proud to be able to provide this crucial product in support of our country's security and defense.","I will now turn the call over to Bruce to review our 2017 financial performance and discuss our expectations for 2018. We will then open up the lines for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Marillyn and good morning, everyone. I will be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results.","We finished the year with strong results in all key financial metrics. Sales exceeded $15 billion in the quarter, rebounding as expected from the lower than planned sales in the third quarter resulting in $51 billion in sales for the year. Segment operating profit was line with our expectations for the year at $5.1 billion, driving our earnings per share to $13.33, prior to the onetime adjustment to recognize the impact of the new corporate tax rate on our deferred tax asset balances at the end of the year.","We continue to have strong cash performance in the quarter, generating $6.5 billion for the full year. We delivered on our commitments to return cash to stockholders with $4.2 billion returned through dividends and share repurchases and we ended the year with about $100 billion in backlog. So we are pleased with our overall performance in 2017. On chart 4 we compare our sales for 2017 with our sales for 2016. Sales grew 8% over last year's results to just over $51 billion for the year, which is the highest level we have ever achieved. I will show how that growth was spread amongst our four business areas on the next chart.","Chart 5 compares 2017 sales levels versus last year's results for each of the business areas. All four business areas grew sales compared to 2016. Aeronautics was up 13% over last year driven primarily by higher F-35 production and sustainment volume and those delivery of two additional C-130 aircraft in the year. Rotary and mission systems grew 6% in 2017. Due to lower purchase accounting adjustments in 2017, as well as a favorable change in aircraft mix. Missile and fire control grew 9% in 2017 driven by higher volume and deliveries in the fire control, tactical missiles and air defense lines of business.","And finally, space was slightly higher than last year with higher AWE sales more than offsetting the volume from two commercial launches in 2016 versus none in 2017 and lower government satellite volume this year. On chart 6 we compare our earnings per share in 2017 with our results from 2016. As I said on the first Slide, our EPS for this year before the impacts of tax reform, is $13.33, or about $1 higher than our EPS in 2016.","On a GAAP basis, our EPS was $6.64 after recognizing a $1.9 billion charge to earnings, primarily to reflect the lower value of our deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate of 21%. And as you could tell from our cash performance in the year, this charge had minimal impact on cash from operations. We show our cash performance on chart 7. We generated $6.5 billion in cash from operations in the year, about $300 million higher than we had outlook during the October call and a record level for the corporation. This amount represents a 25% increase in cash from operations over the 2016 result which was itself a record level at that time.","Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders during the year, with $6.5 billion in cash from operations and almost $1.2 billion of capital expenditures in the year, our free cash flow was $5.3 billion. And with almost $4.2 billion of cash returned in the form of either dividends or share repurchases, we returned 79% of our free cash flow in the year. Chart 9 provides both our pro forma 2017 results and our 2018 outlook under the new revenue recognition methodology that became effective on January 1st of this year.","Our sales and segment operating profit were in line with the estimate that we provided during the October call. You will notice that our pro forma results also reflect the new accounting standard to record only the FAS pension service cost and operating profit and non-service FAS pension cost and non-operating costs. Because our pro forma segment operating profit was similar to the profit under the old revenue recognition methodology, our EPS is close to as reported for 2017. And of course, cash from operations was not affected by the revenue recognition change. Our outlook for 2018 sales and segment operating profit is also about what we provided during the October call with sales growing about 2% over the 2017 level and a margin of 10.4% at the midpoint.","Projected EPS for 2018 is significantly higher than 2017 due to the lower tax rate, higher segment operating profit and improved FAS\/CAS outlook that I will describe in a couple of charts. Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $3 billion after our decision to accelerate $3.4 billion worth of required pension contributions for 2019 and 2020 into 2018 or a total contribution of $5 billion in order to retain the tax deduction for these contributions at the old statutory rate of 35%.","The $3 billion outlook for cash from operations may seem higher than expected given that we have provided a preliminary outlook of $5 billion in cash from operations for 2018 during our discussion on the October call and we are contributing an additional $3.4 billion more to our pension trust than we discussed at that time. The reason for the higher cash is twofold. First, we expect to have about $900 million refund from our 2017 taxes paid because of the additional pension contributions and we also expect to pay about $500 million less in cash taxes during 2018 as a result of tax reform.","I will also provide more insight into what this acceleration of pension funding means for out year cash from operations in a couple of charts. Chart 10 shows our outlook for 2018 sales and segment operating profit by business area. We have provided pro forma sales and segment operating profit for 2016 and 2017 reflecting the new revenue standard and pension expense presentation in the attachments to our earnings release for comparison purposes.","Turning to chart 11. We show the updated FAS\/CAS adjustment outlook for 2018 compared with what we discussed in October [indiscernible] basis points versus the level we expected in October to a rate of 3.625% and that lowered the FAS\/CAS adjustment by $115 million. Our actual return on assets in 2017 increased through the end of the year to 13% versus the 9% we assumed in October, improving the adjustment by $75 million. We revised the longevity assumptions for our plan participants which improved the adjustment by $25 million and the planned asset returns on the additional $3.4 billion of contributions in the year, improve the adjustment by $165 million to the current outlook of just over $1 billion for the year.","Chart 12 provides a view of how tax reform and our decisions to accelerate required pension contributions impacts our cash from operations outlook for the next three years. We have already described the reason for our 2018 outlook of equal to or greater than $3 billion in cash from operations, we expect to fund this acceleration through cash from operations, cash from the balance sheet and commercial paper rather than long-term debt. And with the acceleration of contributions into 2018, we no longer have required contributions in 2019 or 2020. With this improvement along with the annual benefit from tax reform going forward, we now expect our cash from operations to be equal to or greater than $17 billion for the years 2018 to 2020 with both 2019 and 2020 expected to have around $7 billion in cash generation.","Finally, we have our summary on chart 13. We finished the year strong in 2017 and that positioned us well for 2018. The benefits of accelerating our pension contributions into 2018 and the recurring benefits of tax reform provide for significant cash generation in 2019 and 2020. Our portfolio of programs and capabilities positions us well for today's environment and what we expect in the years to come and we plan to make the necessary investments in new technologies, our facilities and our employees to support future growth.","With that, we are ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we go first to the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just Bruce, I guess, on your chart 12, if you could maybe talk about the cumulative cash guidance of $17 billion. How do we think about the moving pieces? Pension a bit of, more of a headwind then we thought. Maybe 1.7 in taxes and offset. So how do we think about maybe working capital investments as well as CapEx and any other moving pieces?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So thanks, Sheila. Maybe to reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks. We had, I think we had teed this up actually in the October call that we had some, the return of some fairly significant pension contributions starting in 2018, 19 and 20. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019d expected cash in 2018 to be a little lower than 2017 before all these adjustments took place. So our decision clearly to accelerate the pension contributions in the 2018 was based on the tax benefits, maintaining the tax benefits to 35% rate provides to us. And I think that\u2019s good commonsense as I mean, the one think I would tell you is that doesn\u2019t create per se an extra benefit to us. It's really maintaining the benefit that we had under the old tax rate all along. And the real benefit here is coming from tax reform going forward. And you should think of that as roughly $0.5 billion a year going forward.","The working capital question that you asked about is a little convoluted perhaps because some of the pieces on working capital changed under the new revenue recognition approach on the balance sheet, if you will, moving from some inventory numbers up to contract assets but in total we will still think to have no material growth in our working capital over the next three years period frankly. The one -- I think you had one other question, I am sorry, just is top off my head there, you asked about capital expenditures.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Yes.","Bruce Tanner","You know capital expenditures were at a record level in 2017. We actually expect to have a higher level in 2018. A lot of the reason for the additional capital in 2018 is supporting the new wins that we had in 2018. That number stays fairly consistent with where we are expecting 2018 to be and 2019. And then at least current planning is that drops off maybe a little bit in the 2020 timeframe but all that\u2019s dependent upon new opportunities as they present themselves and the potential to have efficiencies that we haven't currently invested in in our contracts going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","A couple of probably quick ones. The actual tax rate for '18 is going to be what, 18%, 18.5%? The second part, the Sikorsky profit you said was up $60 million but still would suggest to me they only made about $10 million in the quarter. And I know you have got the amortization yet but that still seemed like a low number if you could explore that a little bit. And then the last one is it would seem like the F-35 margin went up a little bit based on the incremental profit that you disclosed. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","I think pretty accurate there. 18% is maybe a little less than that, frankly, is what we are looking at. And just to put maybe a little color behind that, sort of the headline reduction you would expect to see is sort of 14% [indiscernible] 35% tax rate and 21% tax rate. We think our effective tax rate is probably coming down about 10% and the reason for that is two-fold. One, we are losing the manufacturing deduction which was phased out under the new tax policies going forward. That\u2019s worth about 2% change in our effective tax rate. And then if you just think of the other deductions that we have that are still maintained going forward, but each one of them, those are for things like the R&D expense, this is for things like ESAF deductions and the like. While they are maintained, they are worth less under a 21% tax rate than they were under a 35% tax rate and so collectively those are worth about another 2%. So 14% becomes 10% and our 27%, 28% tax rate, sort of before tax reform becomes roughly 17%, 18% going forward. That\u2019s sort of the way we think about that.","Sikorsky, $60 million in the quarter. I am just trying to think, George, I think Sikorsky had actually a pretty good quarter in 2017. I mean that\u2019s, in fact I think that was, if I am not mistaken, that was probably the highest quarter of profit in the four quarters for 2017. So I think we are pleased actually with the results in the quarter. We obviously had higher aircraft delivery in the quarter and we also had a little bit of an improved mix situation on the deliveries of the aircraft that did occur in the quarter. So we are actually pretty pleased where it is and we think the good news about that is Sikorsky's profitability we expect to be higher in 2018 than in 2017.","And then lastly I think you asked about the F-35 margin and you are right. We did have some risk retirements in the quarter on the F-35 program that did result in higher margins in the quarter on the F-35 program. But I will say we had good performance on the manufacturing, especially the production obviously. A portion of the F-35 program throughout the year. This was just the last sort of instantiation of that in the form of some risk retirements that we took in the fourth quarter. So good performance overall.","Operator","And next we will go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Samuel Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about tax reform and some of the moves with regards to pension and how to think about capital allocation. September is when you typically deal with the dividend, now with a much lower operating cash flow number from the pension contribution. Does it change your view of the payout or how to think about dividend growth and then, Bruce, could you just give us a single point where some range is to when you said CapEx is up. What is that number for this year?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Sam, I will take both of those. So capital allocation, U.S. tax reform and capital allocation impacts from that. As you said, and I don\u2019t want to preempt the Board's decision, we will have that conversation in September. But we don\u2019t expect there to be a significant change with any of the capital allocation items that we have already anticipated in our guidance for 2018. So for instance our guidance in October we talked about $1 billion of share repurchases. That won't change. We will have our normal discussion on dividends in September of later this year. And I think our overall capital allocation, I would say it's a little bit opportunistic base going forward. We will see what sort of organic opportunities present themselves that require capital expenditures and that\u2019s clearly our first order of priority in terms of generating organic growth going forward.","And then we will take a look at the, what's left over, so to speak, for share repurchases and dividend payouts. But I would think that if you look at our track record for well over a decade, we have had a pretty good track record for I think doing the right things in terms of cash returned to stockholders and supporting the growth needed to support our corporation going forward. So we will continue that going forward. The one thing about our cash flow and in particular the tax reform going forward is it obviously makes our payout ratio a little bit lower than it has been in the past. So it creates at least the opportunity to continue the sorts of dividend increases that we have had in years past but we will face that and cross that bridge in the September timeframe when we do that with our Board, as I said,","The absolute number in terms of 2018 CapEx is around $1.3 billion and at least as we sit here today, Sam that 1.3, maybe a little more than that in 2018, is about the same number we will see in 2019. Maybe a little lower than that. But you should think of both years at least, if not rounding to, being pretty close to $1.3 billion. Thanks.","Operator","And next we will go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","So Bruce, if you could give us a profile of the deliveries and sales and profits of Sikorsky going forward, I mean I assume we are going to see some pickup in commercial deliveries this year. And secondly, you said that, as you look out to 2021, you will have to start pension contributions again, I think by our math you have done significantly well in terms of the contribution and the returns so that you should be relatively near full funding by the end of this year. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks, Cai, good questions. So I think your first one is delivery profile and sales, earnings and profit going forward for Sikorsky and whether or not we expect to see a pickup in commercial deliveries. You know what's going on with Sikorsky is a pretty good drop off in terms of commercial or -- excuse me, in terms of government aircraft deliveries from 2017 to 2018. You should think of the 2017 was the end of multiyear [eight] [ph] and 2019 is sort of the first year of multiyear nine deliveries. And I think we are down about 50 or so between the Black Hawk program and Naval Hawk program, down some 50 commercial -- excuse me, 50 government helicopters. So pretty good reduction. And part of that is because the multiyear nine was a lower value in terms of overall quantity than multiyear eight and we negotiated a minimum quantity and that\u2019s sort of what's in our planning purposes going forward. We are obviously hopeful and we gave pricing for that in the multiyear for additional aircraft that we hope will openly get plussed up through budget adjustments going forward.","The good news is we have already got those aircraft priced, if you will, in the multiyear. So we are kind of at the, hopefully, a bit of the low point there on the government deliveries. As far as commercial, Cai, though I think I have been watching, which I don\u2019t normally do but I have been watching oil prices a bit and $65 here a barrel for at least a couple of weeks or so. I think we have got some more time to wait before and we need $65 a barrel to stay at that level for a little bit longer to sort of drive some of the volume of helicopters in the oil and gas industry. So we are obviously not expecting a large increase on the commercial helicopters in 2018 compared to 2017. And frankly, we are looking pretty flat in 2019 as well. Obviously, that could change pretty quickly depending on oil and gas prices. So as I said, we do watch that closer.","Long term with Sikorsky, we like to see the growth coming from the 53K program as we start to enter the low rate production aircraft, excuse me, low rate production phase of that program. And hopefully you should think of sort of the downturn in Black Hawk helicopter deliveries being offset by upticks in 53K volume as well as some of the other development programs we have got going like the Presidential helicopter program as well. So you should think of Sikorsky, this is again kind of a low point in sales in 2018 and some growth going forward in 2017 and beyond. So 53K, I think we are going to be, for those of that attend the Berlin Show, we are actually going to have that aircraft fly in Germany. And we are excited by the prospects of that opportunity not just for the U.S. Marine Corps, which I believe the quantity is about 200 aircraft in the plan of record for the Marine Corps. But we are hopeful that we can sell some international customers, the two most likely to be are either Germany or Israel. I am not sure which order that would be but if you happen to be in Berlin, by all means stop by and see the aircraft flying.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Quick question, maybe changing gears a little bit to the F-35 program. On their earnings call, Northrop commented in their mission systems segment that they are producing about 90 units a year which they call peak production rates. And to me that kind of seemed well below the plan of record, I am not sure if they misspoke or what. But just trying to get a sense, I mean are we at peak production rates. I mean that kind of seems consistent with something Pat Shanahan said in public comments already. But I am just trying to get my head around like what peak rates are and where they should be, and I will leave it there.","Bruce Tanner","Hey, Ron. Let me take a shot at that, and I think there was some confusion by both the secretary's comments and I saw what was said by the Northrop Grumman folks as well. I think the message everyone is trying to send is, when you are delivering 90 aircraft or 90 million systems, or 90 of anything, that\u2019s a pretty high production rate. Different than most low rate initial production programs. But the F-35 program is technically not a full rate production until I believe our past LRIP 14, I think the first production lot is sort of fiscal year, or our fiscal year that will be the lot after LRIP 14. So technically we are in low rate initial production but the quantities are very very high and you should just think if we are at 90 some odd units, which is again what Marillyn said we are going to be delivering aircraft flies in 2018, and the mission systems sort of the front end of deliveries. That\u2019s the reason they could be at that rate in 2017. You should think of in the next three to four years, we are going to be at the 150 aircraft per year.","So we are not close to the peak of production yet but at the volume we are talking about now, it feels like we are in a production program. I think that\u2019s what the secretary was trying to say is, this is not low rate. If you are delivering 90 aircraft a year, it feels sort of like a production program which you should not think if that is the peak. And, hey, before we go to next one, I realize that I jotted a note down to myself and I completely forgot to answer Cai's last question [indiscernible] contribution. And Cai kind of asked you know, are we getting close to full funding and so forth. One thing I would say is, is one of the things we looked at while we decided on $5 billion is the right number. We are getting close enough to where we -- we need to be careful to not yet overfund it on our pension program.","So while funding starts again up in 2021. It starts up at a much much lower level than what we currently funded for the 2019 and 2020 required contributions with our $5 billion. So part of that reason again is in the year 2020, we have the final close or the final freeze, excuse me, of our pension going forward and that\u2019s one of the things that brings that down. But we have been putting a lot of, obviously funding into the pension plan over the past years and just gets us to the level that I just described about to you. Sorry, about that Cai.","Operator","And next we will go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Safran","I would like to ask another different type of question regarding the impact that tax reform here and I am not trying to rein on the parade at all here, but there is a lot of chatter on the hill and within the investment community that the Pentagon is to look to either try to capture or claw back some portion of the tax benefit the defense companies are getting from the lower rates. The thinking is that the government could either renegotiate existing contracts or might look to re-price items on future contracts. Now I am not sure how the government can renegotiate existing contracts but I would like to know if that\u2019s something you are hearing from the government and if so I would like to get your response to that. Maybe discuss how you see your future contract and pricing negotiations being impacted by tax reform.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, Rich, and I will take that one on because I have been very much involved with my fellow CEOs on looking very hard at this opportunity for tax reform to make this more competitive in the global marketplace. So let's remember first off, what the administration and Congress enacted significant tax reform. It was to make the U.S. economy more globally competitive and to encourage industry to invest in America to create jobs and accelerate economic growth. And Lockheed Martin is one of the leading companies that has been pushing for tax reform. We have had that. So we with that in mind we have this purposely set in mind, as you heard from my remarks earlier, that what the purpose of the tax reform is and as we evaluate options of what we want to do with these tax savings. It's all around that purpose that our government put forward.","So as I said in our remarks, our vision is to use these benefits to differentiate ourselves in the global marketplace through investments. And what makes us more innovative and more efficient so that we can grow our business and we can create new jobs. We wanted to also enhance the skills of our current workforce as we look at what's happening with digitization and all that transformation that\u2019s happening. We want to make sure that our workforce is prepared for the future and we also want to make sure that we are an attractive employer for our future workforce by investing STEM activities and helping in the communities where we work.","So this is particularly important. If you think about the U.S., we are graduating fewer students with STEM degrees and yet many of our programs require only U.S. citizens to work on them. So we need students who are coming in with STEM educations, to come into those jobs. Frankly, if we don\u2019t do this, I think we would have wasted the incredible potential the tax reform presents to us. If you think about our industry aerospace and defense, it is the backbone of global security and we take this mission very seriously and we are determined to make sure that we remain competitive by investing in our business, by enhancing our critical capabilities, by investing on our human capital, our employees. So that we can help protect the nation, our allies and our partners. So I would just take you back to the point of why the tax reform was put in place. It was to invest in America to create jobs and accelerate economic growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Bruce, Marillyn, on the aeronautics side, can you just walk us through the limited growth of operating profits into '18. I am assuming it would just be the legacy programs offsetting F-35 growth. And then just looking forward, can you help us think about the growth of the segment and where it comes from. Is it going to be the F-35 or maybe some of the other programs you have been talking about?","Bruce Tanner","Within aeronautics you are talking about, Rajeev, the last part of the question.","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So margin wise at aero, we are guiding towards a little bit lower number in 2018 versus 2017. Back to George's question, we did have a number of risk retirements on some earlier F-35 LRIP production lots that we took in 2017 that at least -- and I will say they were a little higher than what we had planned for in 2017. And so while we have planned risk retirements for F-35 production in 2018, they are not at the same level as they were in 2017. So while we have opportunities, as I always say about this time of the year, to do better than what we are planning. The planning right now is just for a lower level than that. That\u2019s driving it, I will say more than the mix of programs on the F-35. And the one thing that may is not true about what I just said is we are hopeful that there will be a TX or the APT program, the pilot training program for the air force, announced later this year. That will have a slight dilutive effect on the overall margins because it starts kind of slow as a program to begin with, especially if it's later in the year 2018. But that has a slightly lower, not slightly lower, quite a bit lower starting margin than our other programs within aeronautics.","I mean you should think of the F-35 now is about on par, margin wise, with the overall aeronautics margins as a whole. And that\u2019s in part because the F-35 program is simply becoming so big relative to aeronautics as a whole. So again, slightly lower in 2018 versus 2017. Maybe the other reason for that is we did finish the last F-16 production aircraft delivery in 2017. We actually have quite a bit of F-16 modernization business but those are sort of starting out in the early phases than is our practice typically on early start programs like that. We are actually starting those off at probably a lower margin than the actual aircraft that deliver at the end of 2017. So I think those two reasons, Rajeev, are the reasons that you are seeing what you are seeing.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Stallard","Marillyn, you mentioned missile defense in your commentary a number of times. I was wondering if you could size the revenue exposure that you had in 2017 and how you expect this end market to grow for the next few years. And then just a quick one for Bruce, how do you expect on the FAS\/CAS expense in this new format to track over the next three years to 2020. Thank you.","Marillyn Hewson","Bruce, I am actually going to refer to you on the revenue rolled up on all of missile defense. Because you know it crosses over several business areas between rotary mission systems and [indiscernible].","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So let me take a shot at that Rob. The areas you want to think of, frankly, is we do treat within missiles and fire control, air missile defense has its own line of business and you should think of that, so obviously the PAC-3 programs, THAAD and the [indiscernible] program, when we get that going. That\u2019s about $2.5 billion worth of business a year. What's not included in that and off the top of my head, I am not sure I have got a definitive number for you, is the air missile defense and ballistic missile defense activities that we do at RMS. This is for things like Aegis Ashore but also some of the Aegis BMD work. If I had a guess, a ballpark, it's probably $0.5 billion there and then arguably you could say some of the space based early warning satellites that space systems are also some of that. So if you just kind of combine all those things together, I guess I could do some of the C-2 command and control activities that we do as well. ","So maybe $3 billion, $3.5 billion worth of air missile defense and BMD work across literally three of the four business areas that we have today. The second part. The second part of the question was FAS\/CAS in the new format. So FAS\/CAS doesn\u2019t change because of the new format, it changes how much of pension expense is reflected in operating income versus non-operating. That\u2019s one of the reasons, quite honestly that we have always focused more on segment operating profit as opposed to operating profit, because segment operating profit is unaffected by this. If you just take a step back and take a look at FAS\/CAS going forward, we expect FAS\/CAS to increase pretty significantly over the next few years. I still see in the year 2020, that we are going to have FAS income rather than FAS expense. And so just to maybe size that for you, you should think of the CAS expense between sort of now and 2022, as we look forward, staying at about $2.5 billion a year. But FAS expense is going to decrease every year over that period of time and actually go to become income in 2020 and higher income in 2021 and higher than that in 2022. So the FAS\/CAS adjustment will pick up steam quite a bit starting next year and every year there are after, at least as we can see it all the way through 2022 and beyond.","Operator","And next we will go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Kent Keay","A little bit more on missile defense, Marillyn, you obviously talked about in your prepared remarks, Bruce thanks for the color you just gave. You obviously had a lot of success in mid-course and terminal but eventually have been able to crack the code on boost phase. And I don\u2019t know if this is also an embedded tax reform question about maybe freeing up some money for some R&D but how do you expect Lockheed to participate in the missile defense form in maybe a boost phase capacity going forward. Is there an opportunity to really kind of think ahead on that and that kind of own that realm if you are able to sort of think forward? Can you talk about layered missile defense, that\u2019s a big part of it.","Marillyn Hewson","That\u2019s a great question, Hunter, and we do look across all elements of helping our customers address those priorities. And we are investing in research and development. So one of the tests that we did recently, we call it [indiscernible] but it was a navy test where we tested our Aegis system with the capabilities of an F-35 and we are able to have the F-35 identify the launch of a target well in advance of when the Aegis radar would have seen it, so bringing a lot of our capabilities together into a total systems solutions is one of the areas that we are investing in and demonstrating some of that capability across domains within our organizations to provide those kind of capabilities to our customers. Beyond that we continue to look at a range of things that we are investing in, such as hypersonics and directed energy and things that would help with any kind of threat that comes early on. And as Bruce outlined for you, we have several systems that are in that defense mode of addressing all phases of a missile launch. Anything you want to add, Bruce?","Bruce Tanner","The only thing I would add Hunter is, no one has the portfolio that Lockheed Martin does in terms of layered defense. I mean if you think of the think of the products we offer with PAC-3, THAAD, the overhead assets with satellites, the incredible fusion of sensors that comes from an F-35 and being able to feed it to an Aegis system, for instance. Having said that, what's termed left of launch is a vexing problem to be solved and Marillyn hit some of the opportunities that we are looking at to do that. Hypersonic capabilities in terms of weapons is one of those things that we are definitely looking at to help solve that problem. But that is high on our list of some of the more vexing problems that we are trying to solve for and definitely one that we are investing in, we will continue to invest in with our technologies going forward. Because it is an issues and it is something that we bring a unique perspective to with all the assets of our portfolio.","Marillyn Hewson","With your point about using some of the savings out of tax reform to go invest back into these areas, I think that is right in line with what would support our customers and will support the defense of our nation.","Operator","And next we will go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","What is the path looking like to accelerating sales growth beyond 2018. I know that there is some specific items impacting this upcoming year but just thinking about getting back to that 3% to 5% in '19 and beyond. Some of the things you have good visibility on there. And then also how is that acceleration or how is the shape of the curve impacted by some of the recent budget actions, whether it's extended CR, [sequester] [ph] plays versus Congress marking up budgets to much higher levels than what the President has even requested.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So, Jon, I will take that one on. As far as the path, as you describe it to accelerating, we now describe 2018 as sort of a transition year. We had obviously significant growth in 2017, all four business areas as I talked about grew individually. We don\u2019t have that situation in 2018 but as we look forward and I think I teed this up on the October call, that 2018 was a bit of a lull and then 2019 and 2020, we expect both of those years to be somewhere in the 4% to 5% growth range as we look at our outlook right now. And to sort of tie that into your question on the budget and the impact of CR, I don\u2019t think CR does a whole lot of impact in 2018. In fact I know it doesn\u2019t. Longer term I am not sure it has a huge impact on 2019 or not. I will say this though, the 4% or 5% that we are talking about is sort of based on the current presidential budget outlook. So some of the numbers that are being tossed about including most recently by the President himself for 2019, as well as some of the comments that Secretary Mattis has made about 2019 being sort of the year that he is going to put his stamp, those are my word, on the DoD budget. Those are baked into the numbers that I just talked about with the 4% to 5% growth.","So assuming those come in at anywhere near the levels, the higher levels that we are talking about, I like to see us be able to at least...","Greg Gardner","John, this is Greg. We have got time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","If it's okay, I would like to ask two things. Bruce just quickly, one for Bruce, one for Marillyn. On the outlook, on the 19, 20 cash flow, if we were to normalize free cash flow and take the $7 billion from your chart 12 and knock off CapEx of a little over $1 billion and may be normalize for the pension contribution. Would it be fair to say free cash flow on a normalized basis is in the high 4s, almost $5 billion.","Bruce Tanner","So I would have said it's in the high 5s. When you said normalized for pension contribution, are you trying to say...","Robert Spingarn","Well, I am putting in what a normal pension contribution, in other words if we smooth what you are doing.","Bruce Tanner","Beyond 2020, you mean, Rob?","Robert Spingarn","Well, yes. Or if we were to factor what you spent this year, the early contribution and normalize for. In other words, we have a timing situation here and I want to think about what the normalized free cash flow is on an ongoing basis.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So you should again think of, I mean the simplistic way I think of it is, John, you know cash from operations at least for '19 and '20 is $7 billion, is kind of what we teed up there. $1.3 billion I have talked about in 2019 from a CapEx perspective, actually going lower than that. So let's just call it $1.2 billion or so. You have got a $5.7 billion, $5.8 billion free cash flow number pre any pension funding. And as I said, the contribution starting in 2020 are significantly lower than the contributions that we had, that were required in 2019 and 2020 probably by an order of half those contributions that were required. And again, depending on how we do with the asset returns, with the additional $3.4 billion, I am hopeful 2018 is another year of strong asset returns, that number could get smaller. So I think simplistically thinking, free cash flow, we are close to $20 a share in 2019 and 2020 and depending upon what the pension contributions are required in 2020 and beyond.","Marillyn Hewson","You said 2020 but you mean 2021.","Bruce Tanner","2021, I am sorry. Yes.","Marillyn Hewson","Rob, you had question for me, or -- okay, looks like we lost him. Okay. So I guess we will wrap up the call then. John, thank you. Thank you all of joining us on the call today. I want to end this call by reiterating that we really had an exceptional year. A very strong year and it's because of our outstanding portfolio and our robust backlog that we continue to be well positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and to our stockholders. So that concludes our call today, John.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to have you joining us as we review our first quarter results and some key operational accomplishments from across our Company.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank our team for their high level of performance as we continue to focus the organization on long-term growth and value creation. The corporation continues to deliver critical solutions and products to our customers while also returning value to our stockholders and I\u2019m extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team.","As today\u2019s release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. We will review the results in-depth a little later on the call. I\u2019m very pleased that our strong year-to-date financial performance across all business areas and our expectations for the remainder of 2018 have enabled us to increase our full-year outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share.","Our financial results and increased outlook reflect the outstanding execution across our four business segments and the strength provided by our broad portfolio of products and services. I will cover some performance highlights from our business areas in a just moment. But, first, I want to recognize, one significant operational milestone that was retained this month.","Our F-35 team celebrated the conclusion of the System Design and Development phase or SDD flight test program, fulfilling the final requirements at Naval air station, Patuxent River. Since the inception of this test program over eleven years ago, F-35 aircraft have successfully completed over 9,200 test sorties, totaling over 17,000 flight hours and satisfied over 65,000 test points, marking the conclusion of the most comprehensive complex and rigorous developmental flight test program in the aviation history.","I would like to thank the entire F-35 enterprise including industry and government teams for their dedication and diligence as this unrivalled stealth fighter jet progressive on to its next chapter.","Turning to the Department of Defense budget, we were very pleased to see Congress enact the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2018 providing much needed funding for our nation's military and national security. Notably the 2018 Appropriations Act raised DOD based budget funding to $600 billion over 14% above 2017 level representing the largest year-to-year increase in base budget funding for the Department of Defense in 15 years.","When coupled with the overseas contingency operations funding the total amount appropriated for defense activities rose to $665 billion, included in this increase was a recognition of the need to significantly recapitalize our nation's forces with the investment accounts appropriated at levels over 20% greater than the previous fiscal year.","Lockheed Martin programs were especially well supported in the budget markup, with the legislation including increased funding for 20 additional F-35 fighter jets, 17 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 16 additional Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, two CH-53 K helicopters and increases in multiple missile production programs as well as our Orion contract.","All told key Lockheed Martin programs representing all four of our business areas received over $7 billion of appropriations above the fiscal year 2018 budget request, a clear sign of the strong support our broad portfolio has garnered from the customer community.","I'll close my budget discussion with a look ahead to fiscal year 2019. In February Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and raised the defense budget caps in both 2018 and 2019. We were very pleased to see appropriations enacted to support the 2018 increase in base budget funding.","We are encouraged by these legislative actions that provide our military with the resources needed to enable them to fulfill their crucial mission and we are hopeful that the fiscal year 2019 funding process will follow the same positive path in the coming months.","Before addressing our business area highlights for this quarter I would like to provide you a brief update on activities relating to our opportunities in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Just this month I had the honor of hosting his Royal Highness, Mohammad Bin Salman the crown prince of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at our Sunnyvale, California location.","During his visit his Royal Highness was able to see firsthand the innovative satellite technology being incorporated into two new satellites which Lockheed Martin is building to provide enhanced telecommunications capabilities in Saudi Arabia. As part of this historic tour the crown prince also saw some of our air and missile defense product line including key elements of our THAD system an important component of the joint global security announcement the U.S. and Saudi Arabia made last May.","We remain in discussions on several opportunities with the kingdom and in March we were awarded a contract for nearly $500 million to fund long lead activities for construction of four multi mission service combatant ships a key element in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's defensive strategy.","We look forward to continuing our more than 50 year partnership with the kingdom to help them provide for the security of their citizens and support to his Royal Highness's Saudi vision 2030 is a blueprint for transformation of their country.","Moving on I would like to highlight several operational milestones we achieved across the corporation during the recent few months. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, during the first quarter, I was proud to represent our cooperation at the Korea roll out ceremony at our manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The Republic of Korea and the U.S. government leaders celebrated the public debut of the first F-35 produced for the Republic of Korea Air Force.","The ceremony was attended by over 450 guests and represented a major program milestone as the Korean Air Force took delivery of the first aircraft in its 40 jet plane of record, five more will follow this year. As our production line continues to ramp up and we progress on our 2018 goal of delivering more than 90 aircraft to our U.S. and international customers.","Keeping with our aeronautics business area, this quarter our aero team celebrated the delivery of the 400 C-130J Super Hercules as the air force special operations command received its latest Commando II special ops model of the vulnerable C-130J platform. The hallmark of the C-130J is its versatility and this aircraft supports 17 different mission configurations including this Special Forces version.","The performance of this remarkable plane has drawn global demand with operators in 17 countries. And C-130J have passed over 1.7 million flight hours supporting the varied missions. The C-130J has proven to be the tactical airlift platform of choice and we look forward to continue our global leadership in air mobility for decades to come.","Thirdly, NASA awarded our aeronautics organization and new contract to design, build in flight test, a low-boom flight demonstrator. A new supersonic X-plane, but despite flying an excessive of the speed of sound, we will produce a sonic boom that will not be disruptive to the general public. Because of noise restrictions over land air travel above Mach 1, which creates the sonic boom is currently not allowed.","This program will build on the preliminary design we started several years ago under NASA\u2019s quiet supersonic technology effort. The new demonstrator aircraft will be built in our Skunk Works facility and we look forward to its first flight in just a few years with the goal of making quiet supersonic passenger air travel of reality.","Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, we saw continued demand for our air and missile defense products. Our THAAD team received an award of approximately $460 million for the production and delivery of additional interceptors and engineering support bringing the contract value of our lot 10 program to over $1.2 billion.","We also received an award of over $500 million as the U.S. and international customers look to upgrade their missile defense capabilities using our PAC-3 and PAC-3 missile segment enhancement or MSE, interceptors, lot kits, spares and support equipment. Also U.S. and Polish officials signing agreement for Poland to become the fifth international PAC-3 MSE customer.","The advanced capabilities provided by our PAC-3 MSE interceptors will support the WISLA Air and Missile Defense system intended to protect Poland\u2019s armed forces, citizens and infrastructure and we're honored to have this opportunity.","Before I leave Missiles and Fire Control, I would like to commend the tactical missile team for the successful operational debut of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile JASSM, during a recent allied strikes against Syrian chemical weapons research and storage facilities. A total of 19 JASSM stealth cruise missiles were launched marking their first use in combat and these weapons performed their missions with precision, contributing to the success of the multinational operation.","In the Rotary and Missions systems business area, the U.S navy awarded us a unique contract to develop, manufacture and deliver to high-powered laser weapons systems to eventually be field with the board surface ships. This program the HELIOS contract is initial worth $150 million. However, with options it could increased to nearly $950 million.","This weapon system is the first of its kind and combines laser technology, traditional sensor and systems and counter unmanned aerial system capabilities designed to help provide layered defense support.","This award is a result of our commitment to advancing technology with more than 40 years experience in this domain, including long-standing internal research and development projects as well as customers funded contracts. We are honored to be working with the navy on this program and we are excited by the opportunity this leading edge system brings.","I will close with our space business area, celebrated the successful launch of two upgraded Trident II D5 missiles, certifying the readiness of the crew and the operational performance of the strategic weapon system. The two missiles were launched from the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska. And marked the 166th and 167th successful test launches since design completion in 1989, the most reliable test record for any ballistic missile of its kind.","This modernize Trident missile, will be in service with U.S Navy and United Kingdom royal navy for next two decades adding to our over 60 year heritage of support to the sea leg of the Nuclear Triad. I would like to congratulate our space organization on this significant milestone and for their long history of mission success.","I will now turn the call over to Bruce to review our first quarter financial performance and to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2018. We will then open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thanks Marillyn and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today.","Let\u2019s begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. It\u2019s been a very strong start to the year, sales and segment operating profit were both higher than our expectations for the quarter, while cash was in line with our expectations given the planned pension contribution we made this quarter.","We returned almost $900 million to our stockholders in the quarter nearly $600 million through dividends and about $300 million in share repurchases. Based on these results, we have increased our outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share for the year.","On Chart Four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about 4% higher this quarter compared with last year with three of our four business areas showing growth in the quarter.","Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control both experience high single-digit growth in the quarter. Aeronautics was driven primarily by F-35 production volume, while Missiles and Fire Control was driven by tactical missiles and classified programs volume.","Rotary and Mission systems had double-digit growth in three of its lines of business and was partially offset by lower volume Sikorsky due to lower qualities on our government helicopter programs. As expected space was slightly lower than last year as a result of our continuing cost reduction efforts on follow-on buys of our large government satellite programs.","Segment operating profit was up considerably in the quarter compared with last year's results. RMS had the highest operating profit improvement driven by the absence of the charge taken last year, for the EADGE-T program as well as strong performance across the entire portfolio led by improved performance at Sikorsky.","Aeronautics and missiles of fire control increased due to higher sales volume and improved performance, while space was lower due to the lower sales volume and risk retirements in the quarter.","Turning to Chart Five, we will discuss our earnings-per-share in the quarter. Our EPS of $4.02 was 50% higher than our results last year, driven by the higher segment operating profit results that I just discussed as one of the lower tax rate in the quarter as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted in December.","On Chart Six, we show the impact of our plan pension contribution, so have on our cash from operations profile in 2018. Cash in the first quarter was significantly lower than last year as a results of contributing $1.5 billion to our pension trust this year versus none last year. And with an additional $3.5 billion of contribution planned for the end of the third quarter, we expect cash from operations in the next two quarters to be much lower than our historical results.","In fact, we could see negative cash from operations in the second quarter, given the plan level of contributions in that quarter, because of these contributions we expect our cash generation to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, all-in-all though we remain comfortable with our outlook of greater than or equal to $3 million in cash from operations for the year.","Chart Seven provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $350 million based on higher expectations for Aeronautics, MFC and space for the rest of this year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $115 million due to higher sales volume and improved performance and Aeronautics, MFC and RMFs.","There is no change to our other unallocated expense, or our Net FAS adjustments. We are increasing our earnings per share by $0.60. I will provide more detail into this increase on the next chart. And we are leaving our cash from operations outlook unchanged to greater than or equal to $3 billion.","Chart Eight, provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings-per-share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.32 increase in our EPS, updated to our revised estimated effective tax rate for the year and some other miscellaneous changes drives $0.28 increase in EPS, resulting in a total increase of $0.60 than a new EPS range of $15.80 to $16.10.","On Chart Nine, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook in three of our business areas an increase of $150 million in space, $125 million in Aeronautics, and $75 million in Missiles and Fire Control for a total increase of $350 million above the guidance we provided last quarter.","Chart 10 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our outlook for RMS by $80 million. Missiles and Fire Control by $20 million and aeronautics by $15 million for a total increase of $115 million above last quarter\u2019s guidance.","And finally, on Chart 11, we have our summary, we're off to a very good start to 2018 with strong financial and operating performance across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in the current level of our backlog as well as our future growth prospects and based on results of the quarter we increased our outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share.","With that we're ready for your questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we go to the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Yeah. Hey, good morning. Marillyn, there has been some press about Japan and the U.K. collaborating on advanced stealth fighter if you will, I don\u2019t know something kind of called sixth gen, where does Lockheed stand on that, and how does Lockheed view the market for sixth gen fighters and if you could elaborate on that?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure, thanks, Ron, thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we are excited about Japan looking forward on their next aircraft and their replacement of the F-2 and we're exploring options that we could bring forward to them in cooperation with both the Japanese and the U.S. government, but at that time that we will share relevant details around that appropriate time certainly. We do think that our leadership and experience building the fifth generation aircrafts are critical to provide cost effective capabilities that will help support Japan\u2019s future security threats as they go forward.","Ronald Epstein","And conceptually this sort of like a - how can I say, continuation of F-22, I mean, how should we think about the requirements the Japan wants vis-\u00e0-vis an F-35?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, at this point, Ron, we are waiting you know it\u2019s really a government-to-government matter, I mean they will outline what their requirements are and we have a great experience on the F-22 and on the F-35 and so they look at the capabilities they need, I think we'll have a very good competitive offering for them.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you so much. Just looking at your change in your EPS guide, how much of the $80 million increase at RMS, it\u2019s from Sikorsky and why and how much of the benefit is from a lower tax rate and what is that tax rate?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, Cai, I will take both of those. So, $80 million at RMS, I will say the lion share of that actually is at Sikorsky. I think we are up if memory serves me right, we're up about $50 million in the first quarter and that trend is expected to continue through the next three quarters or so, so that's the bulk of why we're seeing the increase at RMS is because of Sikorsky.","And I think there we are actually finally seeing hopefully getting a little bit of traction with some of the initiatives we put in place and some of the systems, I think that we put in place here recently, that I think are giving a greater insight hopefully into managing some cost controls than the business had previously, so we are hoping that trend continues obviously as we go up through the rest of the year.","And then I think your second question, was relative to tax rates and so forth and I think what I had said at the start of this year was we were looking somewhere between 17% to 18%, probably on the higher side of that, and fortunately we have actually had some with the benefit of the little more time looking at the act and some of our planned reductions relative to what we assumed in the act initially, we think we have got some better opportunities than we assumed in January.","As well as we been really working some of the R&D tax credit items that we always work really hard and we see some benefit coming there as well. So rather than 17 to 18, I think for the year were looking right around 16% as the effective tax rate nearly simply guidance we are provided today.","Operator","Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Yes, good morning guys. Just may be you guys could talk more about the F-35, head of the program obviously I think has made some comments about your strategy in LRIP [indiscernible] negotiations, and I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are satisfied getting - definitised and when do you think that might complete and what is it just like I mean for the 12 to 14 timeline.","Marillyn Hewson","So Pete, I would just take that to say that, we are in in-depth negotiations and we know that the timeline is just how those negotiations go. So in terms of the date to complete, I mean I think that\u2019s just how the negotiations go forward, it\u2019s probably better to ask the PEO from his perspective Admiral Winter what his timeline is. I think the negotiations are progressing as they should and so we feel pretty good about getting the closure in the near-term.","Bruce Tanner","The other thing I might add Pete is I think we have seen some progress here recently in concert with the joint program office closing on some open items that I think will hopefully foretell some good signs relative to getting the whole program closed in the not too distant future. I mean as far as - I think the other part of your question was relative to the block buy 12 through 14. I don't see this being an issue, at least at this point, the other 12 to 14 is more of a funding issue at this point in time, that are negotiation issue. We clearly like to get 11 behind us so we can focus on that and hopefully we are on the right path to get that done in the not too distant future.","Pete Skibitski","Okay, and how you pass this issue with a whole - the recent delivery halt.","Marillyn Hewson","We are not, we are still progressing along with joint program office on that. It\u2019s not affecting production at all, because we continue to produce the F-35, that continues and we are confident, we are going to meet our deliveries this year of over 90 aircraft for 2018. It\u2019s just a temporary suspension that they have on accepting some aircraft until we reach agreement on a contractual issue and so we are working through that contractual issue with them and you know as you know the way we recognize revenue based on cost incurred, so we are posting to head on production and sustainment of the aircraft. And we will get resolution at this soon, I\u2019m expecting.","Operator","Next we will go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey good morning everyone. Marillyn I wanted to ask on the defense budget bigger picture , clearly there have been a few reasonably sizable step ups in investment spending here over the last few years, but when you are speaking to those that have been a part of that seemingly bipartisan decision, it is not discussion at this point now that we have 2018 spending where it is, is that discussion closer to hey we have now had these big step ups, we're relatively close to where we need to be relative to the capabilities we need and the recapitalization we need and we're likely to just sort of grow in line with inflation off of this reset level or is that conversation closer to hey this is great, but we're actually still far short of where we need to be for all the capabilities and recapitalization we need.","Marillyn Hewson","Well in my discussions, I think first off this increase in defense spending was tremendously welcome to our customers, you know we have been in a situation with the budget caps and others where the spending on recapitalization as well as on readiness was not at the level it needed to be. So I see that as welcomed and certainly for industry it\u2019s welcomed, in terms of the planning and stability that we can see at least for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, and we still have limiting out there this whole issue of sequestration, which everybody would like to see go away.","So I won't ignore the fact that that's sitting out there, but what I would say is that the dialogue I have is about the very difficult situation in global security around the world it's just unpredictable, there is a need to move with speed and agility to address the threats that are there, and so is it enough, I mean you know, we don't talk specific numbers and it is not that I haven\u2019t heard anybody say it's enough.","I mean there is not much there in new starts, there is not much there in recapitalization and we know that we really got to focus on that, it\u2019s all some of the near-term issues on readiness to address that, but the need for what is happening with you know what I think secretary matters called the great power competitions with Russia and China and other geopolitical rivals out there that we got to stay on our game and continue to invest.","We're doing that at Lockheed Martin, we're investing in a lot of technology that we think will be important to our customers in the near-term and in the long-term way, but the threats are not going away they are accelerating and so in my view if you just would ask my opinion we need to continue to spend more on defense.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning, Marillyn there was some language in the most recent proxy that suggests maybe you will stay on longer as CEO than maybe the prior customs of the corporation would've indicated, can you talk a little bit about the thinking behind that and about are there one or two specific things that you are looking to accomplish in the remainder of your tenure.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks for the question, well just speaking in terms of my tenure, I serve at the pleasure of the board as does every CEO of a public company and they determine with me on when is the right time for me to step down, so I think it was important for us in our proxy to make that clear, just because people often look at ages and where people are in their long-term program.","I'm happy to report that I celebrated 35 years with Lockheed Martin in January, so I do have a long tenure with the corporation, but I intend to stay on longer and so in terms of what I want to accomplish, I want to continue to sustain the success of this Company with the hundred thousands of men and women that are working hard every day to support our customers.","You know my focus is on how we continue to drive innovation, how we continue to drive performance, the things that we are doing to align with the needs of our customers and make sure that we're performing on the work we're doing today, but we are looking beyond today and also for our shareholders to have a disciplined approach to how we manage the company and make sure that we create shareholder value and bring value to them in the long-term.","So, in a nutshell, I serve at the pleasure of the Board. They elect me annually and I would like to continue to work for some time.","Operator","And next we will go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Safran","Marillynand, Bruce, Greg good morning. How are you?","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good. Thanks.","Richard Safran","So, I would like to ask about your cash flow guidance. Bruce, you took up your numbers, operating profit sales, but you left your 2018 cash from operations guide alone. So first part is, I would like to know if you could just discuss what the thinking was there? And Marillyn, in your opening remarks you talked a bunch about the increases to the investment accounts, so as the second part planned defense spending in 2019 at least it seems to be was a bit above expectations due to lifting of the spending caps, but there wasn't any update on the long-term cash from operations guide. So I thought maybe you could discuss those two items there and how are you thinking about that?","Bruce Tanner","Yes, Richard, let me take the first part of that on cash flow guidance and you are right. We did leave 2018 alone and the thought was a pretty simple thought, I mean, nothing more complicated then, we basically did what we thought we were going to do in the first quarter and then see upside to what our expectations were in the first quarter. And therefore, we didn't increase our outlook for the year.","We have got another three quarters to go for the year. We'll watch that very closely and we'll see if how much of some of the profit improvement actually translates into higher cash improvement throughout the rest of the year and we will update you as you go there. We typically had better performance on cash flow than we said at the start of the year.","I'm not predicting that here in the first quarter yet. But, we'll see as we progress throughout the year. We said at least $3 billion greater than or equal to that and that\u2019s still what we're seeing as we sit here today.","Marillyn Hewson","And just to answer the second part of your first question, we remain hopeful for growth, higher growth, based on the press outs on the budget for 2018 and we hope to see that in 2019 for Lockheed Martin, our programs will still be well-supported, and we will see additional opportunities there.","We don't know specifically how that will play out, because we're a long cycle business and we are going to wait on the final details and the timing of when these things are enacted and get put on contract. So we will see when the orders hit; and then, therefore, that will drive the sales and then ultimately the timing of the cash from operations.","So I can\u2019t really give you a real specific answer to that other than to say just as we always do we look at the opportunities that come. In addition to that, I might mention, there are some other discrete proposals that are in process that could also impact our projections.","As you know, we're pursuing the advanced pilot system, the TX is the terminology we typically use for it, but as well as MQ-25 and the Huey replacement and some others. So those also will have some play into our opportunities looking forward, and then the timing of cash.","Bruce Tanner","Rich, I might just add a little bit to what Marillyn said as well. She mentioned during her prepared remarks the fact that we get more than $7 billion worth of business in the Omnibus bill that just closed, you should think of all that as essentially over and above what we were assuming when we put our guidance out previously.","So when we talked in January about having $17 billion over the next three years roughly $3 billion in 2018, roughly $7 billion each in 2019 and 2020 nothing has changed to that, there as Marillyn said, there are number of awards that we are waiting on that whether if we win or lose could have some slight impact on the near-term of that.","But as we sit here today, we still feel really good about that $17 billion over three year and again with the increase in the budget that Marillyn talked about, hopefully there are some prospects that weren\u2019t in our plan when came up with those numbers.","Operator","Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Thanks Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Marillyn thanks for the color on Saudi. If you guys quantified in terms of the opportunity that you are looking at there and if that\u2019s possible and then Bruce just quickly on three deliveries of the C-130 in the in the first quarter can you kind of give us a expectations for the year or may be the cadence of the year. Thanks.","Marillyn Hewson","The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia opportunity the only qualification that we have done enrolling it up as a potential was what we did last May. When the agreements were signed between the Kingdom and the United States government about opportunities and if you recall I think it was something like a $100 billion worth of opportunities that were outlined in that rolled up agreement.","So when we looked at where our opportunities were in that form Fed, the multi mission surface combatants, to radar, to helicopters, to aero stats a range of things, we communicated that we saw a potential of $28 billion, of course that would roll out over whatever number of years when those orders were placed, contracts signed and so forth, but that\u2019s in essence what we have communicated in terms of the size of the opportunity.","Bruce Tanner","Peter the C-130 delivers, we were a little light in the first quarter, I think that's just sort of the contractual schedule that fell in place in the first quarter, nothing unusual about that. As we look at the remaining quarters for C-130 delivery. I think they are going to average somewhere seven or eight, we might have one quarter or so, where it bounces up to nine aircraft in the particular quarter.","So much higher than what we saw in the first quarter, not a whole lot different than what we saw last year though. I will remind you though this and I appreciate the question on the deliveries, but this is one of the programs obviously that with the new revenue recognition is also being recognized on a cost-to-cost, so the timing of deliveries might not have as much impact obviously on the C-130 programs as it get in years past, just may be to state the obvious.","Operator","Next we will go to Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Harned","Thank you good morning. Looking at your Missiles and Fire Control results which you talked about higher volume on missiles for the quarter. We also saw a big backlog gain in missiles in Q4 and there is some significant budget increases in this area over the next year two years. So when you look at this stage, do you see the surge in missile demand as a short-term trend or something that is likely that persist for a longer period say five or more years? And what would drive that?","Bruce Tanner","I will take a shot at this. Look I think your observations are spot on. I know when I looked at the long-range planning our three-year plan the thing that sort of jumped off the pace to me is Missiles and Fire Controls is amongst our highest growth business areas over that three-year plan period. And that was sort of under the original President\u2019s budget without taking into consideration a number of things that fell out from the Omnibus for instance.","So I think this is a trend that we see increasing at U.S., I think it\u2019s just with the short-term or is it may be out there for five years. I think in every single missile opportunity that we have and that\u2019s always you know PAC-3, the THAAD to JASSMs, the Hellfires, GMLRS, we are looking at increasing the capacity, increasing our build rates in every single one of those categories in the not too distant future.","So I think what you are seeing is not an aberration and I would say it is going to in my judgment last longer than a shorter duration five years or so I think that's a possibility definitely Doug.","Operator","And we will go to Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew McConnell","Thank you good morning. So your 10K this year had some new language about the government taking increasingly aggressive positions around intellectual property rights. Could you elaborate on what has changed or what you were referring to their and how you are reacting to that change?","Marillyn Hewson","Sure Matt, I will just take that. I mean we are seeing - it's not across the board on opportunity that we are pursuing with the U.S. government, but there have been some cases where there have been sort of an unbounded requests for all of the intellectual property rights for us to pursue an opportunity and while we may be able to commit to that from a Lockheed Martin standpoint our challenge that we outlined is that it's very difficult for us to commit to that for our supply chain.","And so we have had some recent RFPs where the intellectual property rights request is seen, in fact we did a pre-award protest for the UH-1N replacement, the Huey replacement because we could not get to a position with the U.S. government in the dialogue up to that point to be comfortable that we could certify that we could provide all of the intellectual property that they requested, because we couldn\u2019t certify that we could bring fourth all of that for some of our subcontractors. So that\u2019s just one example there. I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything or not Bruce.","Bruce Tanner","Yes, I would just piggyback a little bit on what Marillyn said, I think the Huey replacement program is a good example where we have had the Blackhawk helicopter being supported through the Army depots for however long we have been flying or they have been flying Blackhawk helicopters probably 30 years or so, and yet the request that came with the Huey replacement program admittedly an Air force program was actually for far more data and I will say the army is using today to support those aircraft and the fleet.","So it\u2019s a little puzzle as to why the same helicopter would have two different requirements for intellectual property when the government is already supporting that aircraft to the army depots. And that's what we're talking about, it\u2019s just a little bit of a head scratcher sometimes, often times, these are existing platforms with a new request for intellectual property that\u2019s a little puzzling.","As Marillyn said, a lot of it has to do with not so much with Lockheed Martin IP as that of our subcontractors, including, more puzzling than most, a lot of software. And in some cases even some commercial software applications. So that\u2019s the reason it's mentioned in the 10-K. That's the reason we filed the pre-award protest that Marillyn said on the Huey replacement program.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah, thanks very much. Bruce, I wondered if you could just provide some sensitivity around the pension relative to kind of performance of equity markets over the next few years? Just to assume that as we experience kind of the flat S&P for the next five years. What would that do to your cash funding requirement? Thank you.","Bruce Tanner","Hey Joe that\u2019s a good question. As we have taken a look at that. And we have mentioned in the past that we actually get to a full freeze in the pension from January 1, 2020. So it\u2019s sort of disproportionately impactful if that's the right word to use, up until 2020 and then post 2020. So we're more sensitive as you just asked the question to asset returns in the near-term believe it or not than we are which has historically not been the case.","We typically have been more sensitive to discount rate changes, but because the sort of the length of time until the plan becomes fully frozen is getting shorter by the day. We're less sensitive to the discount rate changes between now and then. Asset returns, we have greater sensitivity too, but you shouldn't think of them as being - we have taken I'll say scenarios where we have assumed, instead of the 7.5%, we have assumed zero percent return or zero return in 2018 for instance, just for sensitivity purposes.","And then we have actually gone to some negative scenarios. It's not a huge change. You shouldn\u2019t think of it as being something that where we would have I will say changes to the $17 billion that we talked about earlier as being a significant change to that in total outlook is the way I would characterize it.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Stallard","Thank you so much. Good morning. I thought I would ask you a quick question about GPS III and the Follow On contract there, the competition there. It looks like some of your peers may not bid for this. And I was wondering how that changes the dynamic for you to obviously increases the chance of winning. But also is there anything different in that follow-on contract that makes it less financially attractive than the current situation?","Marillyn Hewson","So, I can\u2019t speak for our competitors, but I can just tell you that we feel very confident about our proposal for the GPS III Follow On. We already submitted those, we put out a release that we have a fully compliant proposal that we have submitted and it\u2019s for us as we see it as follow-on. It\u2019s an opportunity for another 22 next generation satellites to be brought in, we have invested a lot in design with flexible, modular architecture that allows us to bring down costs. But more over that it also is at a low-risk approach to continuing the GPS III F Solution so that\u2019s one thing that I would add is that we think we are performing well on ones that we are producing today and this Follow On, I think we are well position to continue for the Follow On.","Bruce Tanner","The other thing I might add Rob is I think the reason for the competition in the first place is we didn't perform as well as we otherwise could have on the first few satellites, we had some payload issues in particular there. I will say those we think have been cleaned up, I mean we feel really, really good about the performance of the satellites we are producing now, I think the government is also aware that we are performing satellites very well as most of industry.","So not to speak for any of our competitors, but I think the fact that the program is performing extremely well right now, serves us well going to this competition and in your second part of your question sort of is a lower profitability or potential that would cause our peers or competitors not want to do this, we don't see it that way. We see it as essentially the same opportunity as what we have had in the past without a change there. So that wouldn\u2019t be a driver from my perspective.","Operator","Next we will go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, thanks for the question. Marillyn and Bruce just getting some of the discussion out there around the top-line trajectory on the F-35 program, can you maybe just provide some thoughts on how you see revenue growth looking over the next several years for the program and if not may be just thoughts on how it compares to the overall growth rate of the company and to the end of the decade and beyond.","Bruce Tanner","Yes. Rajeev I will take that one and Marillyn can add some top cover if she wants to, but look I think in terms of F-35, the F-35 program in general is going to grow at a faster rate than the corporation is all the way through the end of the decade. In fact I would do tell you that it\u2019s going to do that beyond the end of the decade.","We don't reach peak production volumes until I think 2023 or 2024 timeframe somewhere that timeframe, so you should think obviously we spend the dollars since F-35 is also on the cost-to-cost where were recordings sales sooner than we were getting those deliveries, so it\u2019s a little bit push to the left if you will.","But even with that you should think of that peak is sort of not occurring until past the end of this decade and then our expectation is that with sustainment, the sheer number of aircraft that are in the field growing significantly between now and then that sustainment will help position that growth in the future even when the production starts to slow down.","The last thing I would add is there is still even though as Marilyn said in her prepared remarks, we completed the STD program, there is already the idea, plans in place of the follow-on modernization of the F-35, not just for the U.S government but for international customers as well.","So there will be the sustaining level of development. Just like there is a sustaining level of development and modification work that we're currently doing and F-22's and F-16s that are decades past their peak production period. We are going to see that going for a long, long time on the F-35 program.","Marillyn Hewson","The other thing I would add Rajeev is that we currently have of course the three U.S services, the eight international partners, three for military sales partners on the program, but there is a lot of interest beyond that with many countries around the world that want to buy the F-35, and so while we have a program of record that we can talk about what we see as the production plan for that, we expect to be selling more F-35s around the world in the coming year so that will be another indicator of continued revenue from the F-35 program and production sustainment and as Bruce said continued modernization and upgrade.","Operator","Our next question's from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning Bruce it looks like you raised the margin rate on the F-35 again based on the numbers that you gave, so just wanted to validate that. And then second, could you tell us how many deliveries the Air Force currently hasn't taken and what kind of impact that might have had on cash flow in the quarter. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yes, good questions George, so there was a slight pickup on the total F-35 program, I think the biggest single drivers I recall is we had some increases once again, I think as we did last year on some of our international FACO so this is a Final Assembly and Check Out facility, those are going extremely well and this is another example of this quarter where we recognized some of the benefits of the performance we're seeing there, taking place actually greater than it was a year ago this quarter. So that's the primary reason for the upper in the F-35 program","And then that said the other question was relative to the number of aircraft that are on hold that\u2019s lost track in the quarter George, I want to say it was - I would say its mid single-digits to upper single digits, I have lost track of F-35s, so not a huge impact cash, obviously it didn\u2019t change sales or earnings because of the way we recognized revenue, but slight impact on cash although nit much because most of those withholds occurred later in the quarter where they weren't going to get collective in any event. So our expectation would be, come second quarter hopefully we have got this behind us and there will be no impact to cash in the second quarter.","Operator","Next question's from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks, good morning. Wanted to try and put a finer point on the budget upside that you saw come through and what it means for growth going forward, so you have obviously you know in the past talked about growth accelerating from 2% to 3%, I'm talking top line growth accelerating from 2% to 3% this year to like 4% to 5% in 2019, given the extra $7 billion that you saw come through in normal kind of spend rates what do think that implies for that 4% to 5% number and then as a follow-up Bruce if you could just update us on C-5 and potential resolution there. Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","David you got a good memory there, I'll give you credit for that one. The first part of your question's a really good one, I'll say this, it's at least a $64 million question and it's a question that is almost unanswerable at this point in time, we got to see when that $7 billion start manifesting itself in terms of contract modifications or contract awards to add those increases to our existing programs and my guess is they're all going to get phased-in differently so in some cases on some the missile and the like we are actually sort of at capacity this year.","So I would say just in general I wouldn't expect to see much of any of this shift in 2018, and my guess is it will get spread over 2019, 2020 and 2021 timeframes and maybe even a little further out than that. Let's talk the F-35s, for instance, those I would like to think we could get them in the somewhere in the 12, 13, 14 block buy, but we are off right now going out to suppliers and sort of getting quantities of aircrafts locked down with our suppliers.","So it depends on when they gets authorized and again modded to the contracts that we already have. But, if I were a betting person, I would say you should think most of that\u2019s going to happen in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and obviously, David, I will give you the better insight because we will get better insight into it, as the year goes along, but definitely in the October timeframe when we give trend information for 2019, we'll try to talk about, what it looks like beyond 2019 at that point in time.","I think your last question is on the C-5 equitable adjustment. I literally don't think I have any news on that, David. This year, we finished delivering the last modernized C-5 aircraft, I want to say that aircraft is in, like, the third quarter of this year. My guess is, we will get a lot more action on that closure once the total program is closed if that makes sense.","So again, nothing planned from our perspective, relative to if it doesn\u2019t happen this year, it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a downer or a hit to this year because we don\u2019t have that plan this year. We haven't talked about that, frankly, in the future years as well, but we still expect we have a very good case there. So, no news to report is the short answer.","Greg Gardner","John, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Kent Keay","Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me in. On the supersonic X-plane, is this your technology? I\u2019m wondering if there is a remote scenario where Lockheed reenters the commercial aircraft market, if this design proves out and how your experience moving into the commercial market with the LM-100J might persuade you to do that. Thank you.","Marillyn Hewson","Well, to your point, Hunter, we do have LM-100J and we are happy to have that as a commercial offering. It's a follow-on to LM-100s that we sold to the 100 customers some years back. So having an opportunity to refresh that we also as you have probably seen, are supporting another company that is coming out with the supersonic jet business jet offering Aerion and we are supporting them on their project with some engineering support and other things.","But in terms of our foray into the commercial aircraft aviation side, we don't read too much into this, this technology that we're working on with the low boom, I mean what we are bringing is that we can bring out Skunk Works, which is the low boom technology and a lot of other technology that we can support.","I apologize. I'm fighting a cold here, so my voice is getting a bit scratchy here, but point being what company is come to us, whether its NASA or its commercial companies is our deep knowledge and experience and technology that we can bring to support new technology. So as I mentioned earlier, we are engaged a lot in hypersonic and directed energy. And now this is a follow-on to some low boom technology work that we have done with NASA to take it to the next level.","And our Skunk Works operation is working on it; as there are a lot of our advanced technology labs across the Corporation, working lot of fascinating and interesting advanced technology to help both on the commercial and the military side.","Greg Gardner","Thanks, John this is Greg, I think we have come up at the top of the hour here. So, I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.","Marillyn Hewson","Sure, I will make it brief since I\u2019m losing my voice here. However, just thank you all for [Technical Difficulty] and by highlighting that we have an outstanding quarter and we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term value to our customers and to our stockholders. So we look forward joining us on the next call and that concludes our call for the day John.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentleman that does conclude your conference.

And welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jerry Kircher","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ.","Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.","We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.","Marillyn Hewson","Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As we review our financial results and key accomplishments in the quarter, as well as provide a brief update on some of our strategic initiatives. As today\u2019s release detailed, we continue to drive towards achievement of our full year goal with another quarter of solid operational and financial results.","Although, we continue to face global economic challenges, these results reflect the execution across all of our businesses as the Corporation continues to operate a very strong level in returning value to stockholders, while providing critical solutions to our customers. The daily focus and efforts of our team are the foundation of our ability to deliver broad-base results across the Corporation and I thank them for their ongoing contributions.","Turning to our financials, while, Bruce, will cover the results in detail later, I want to particularly highlight our continued exceptional cash generation. This quarter we achieved approximately $1 billion in cash from operations, bringing our September year-to-date cash generation to over $4 billion.","Strong cash generation is a longstanding hallmark of our Corporation and continues to be a differentiator, as we return cash to stockholder through dividends and share repurchases, while also making appropriate investments in the business.","Our strong and growing cash generation enabled by our Board of directors, enabled them to approve two key cash actions this past quarter. First, we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share and $6 annually. This action represents the 12th consecutive year that our dividend rate has been increased by double-digit percentages.","Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $2 billion, bringing our total current share repurchase authority to almost $4 billion and providing additional flexibility to continue to make future share repurchases.","Beyond the Board actions, we recently completed our Annual Financial Planning process and projections of future financial metrics. I\u2019m excited about the robust cash generation that the plan projects going forward and our ability to implement strong actions to deploy cash back to stockholders.","In light of our future projected cash flows, we are implementing a new cash deployment initiative in which we anticipate reducing our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares over the next three years.","Share repurchases of this magnitude, coupled with our dividend payments would results in our returning vast majority of annual free cash to stockholders over the next three years and continue our longstanding strategy of disciplined cash deployment and value creation for stockholders.","Moving to operations, while numerous mission success events were achieved across the Corporation, I want to highlight two major events achieved by our Space Systems business.","In September, our team successfully inserted the Maven spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Space Systems constructed the spacecraft for NASA and also provides flight operations control of the vehicle as it surveys the upper atmosphere of Mars.","These surveys will provide vital data to scientist seeking to understand how the loss of atmospheric gas to space changed the Martian climate and potentially provide valuable insight into atmospherics dynamics here on earth.","Another area where key accomplishments were achieved by space is on the Orion program. This quarter the inaugural spacecraft was successfully fueled at the Kennedy Space Center and its progressing towards integration with the Delta IV launch vehicle in November. The program continues to progress and it\u2019s in the final stages of preparation for its initial unmanned test flight scheduled later this year in December.","Orion remains an essential national asset in returning capability of manned access to space to our nation in the coming years. We are proud to be serving as the prime contractor on this program and progressing on this critical capability for NASA and our country.","I\u2019d like to briefly switch to our international activities and provide an update on noteworthy achievements in this strategically important area. Progress this quarter was seen both in new strategic partnerships and new business awards.","In the area of new international partnerships, we opened a new Space Technology Office in the United Kingdom. This office will expand our in-country relationships with U.K. companies, government agencies and universities.","We are looking forward to applying our 50-year heritage of Space Systems expertise to develop opportunities in environmental monitoring, space exploration, global security and secure space communications.","And we also opened a new space object tracking site in Australia to construct a more detailed picture of space debris for both government and commercial customers. This site will use electro optical technologies and will compliment radar tracking systems such as the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Space Fence program that we were awarded last quarter.","Beyond our footprint expansion initiatives, new business awards from international customers this quarter included receipt of an $800 million contract from the Australian Department of Defense to develop a centralized information processing environment. This program will significantly improve the efficiency of data delivery by consolidating the department\u2019s 280 data centers into 14.","Additionally, we were very pleased that the Republic of Korea finalized its formal selection of the F-35 for their fighter replacement program and have announced their intent to sign a Letter of Offer and Acceptance between the United States and Korean governments for 40 F-35 aircraft. This program is valued at nearly $7 billion for aircraft and associated support activities.","These recent actions and awards are representative of the growing level of activity that our international strategic initiatives are generating. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are projecting achievement of 20% of international sales content by the end of this year, achieving a goal we outlined to you a few years ago.","Growth in international business content is an essential element in our ability to generate future sales for the Corporation. Projected international sales growth will help offset the impact of U.S. government budget pressures on domestic sales levels.","With growing international demand expected for our products, such as the F-35 fighter and missile defense systems, I\u2019m increasingly confident that our annual international sales content could increase to 25% or higher in the next few years.","Before turning the call over to Bruce, I wish to note that we are very proud to have recently been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and to two carbon disclosure project Climate Change Management Indices.","We are the only U.S. aerospace and defense company to earn a spot on the world index. And our CDP awards mark the fourth consecutive year our Corporation has been recognized for exceptional performance. These prestigious awards reflect our continuing pursuit of sustainable practices through innovation, transparency and sound governance. They also reflect the broad commitment of our workforce that help engineer a better tomorrow.","I\u2019ll now ask Bruce to go through the details of third quarter and full year financial performance and our 2015 financial trend preview. And then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions.","Bruce Tanner","Thank you, Marilyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included in our earnings release today.","Let's start with chart three, an overview of the quarter. As I\u2019m sure, you\u2019re aware, shortly after the second quarter earnings call, The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 or HATFA was enacted. And because this legislation extended the methodology for determining discount rates used for pension contributions established by the MAP-21 Legislation in 2012, it will have a significant impact on our results for the quarter, the year and longer term as well.","We\u2019ll describe the impact this had in the quarter below. I will also spend quite a bit of time in upcoming charts describing these future impacts to you.","Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion in line with our expectations, though down slightly from last year. Segment operating profit was also as expected at $1.3 billion with our segment operating margin remaining strong at 12.1%.","Our net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% to $888 million. And this is where we first see the impacts of the HATFA legislation. The effect of the legislation lowers our FAS\/CAS income for the year by slightly more than $70 million and requires a retroactive adjustment in the third quarter amounting to $55 million or $35 million in net earnings. Without this adjustment, net earnings would have increased by 10% to $923 million. We\u2019ll see the remainder of the $70 million adjustment in the fourth quarter.","Our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $2.76 in the quarter. And again these results were dampened by the impacts of the HATFA legislation in the quarter, which amounted to $0.11 of earnings per share. Without this retroactive adjustment, our EPS in the quarter would have been $2.87, up 12% in the quarter.","Our cash from operations continues to be very strong with just under $1 billion generated in the quarter stronger than we\u2019d expected. So I think we had another solid quarter results and we\u2019re well positioned to finish the year consistent with our guidance.","If you\u2019ll turn to chart four, we\u2019ll highlight just how strong our cash from operations has been this year. Our cash generated in the quarter was almost a $1 billion and this represents a 10% increase over our level from a year ago. And on a year-to-date basis, our results were even stronger with $4.1 billion generated in the first three quarters, up 13% over the comparable time period last year.","Chart five shows our cash deployment actions through the third quarter with dividends to-date of almost $1.3 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion. We\u2019ve returned nearly $3 billion to shareholders through the first three quarters, representing 82% of our free cash flow for the same timeframe.","And as Marillyn said in her remarks, we also increased our dividend in the quarter at 13%, the 12th consecutive year, we have increased our dividend level by 10% or greater. This payout level begins with our fourth quarter dividend.","On chart six, we\u2019ll explain the impacts of the HATFA legislation enactment in more detail. As I mentioned earlier, the legislation was enacted after the July earnings release and in simple terms, it impacts us by extending the methodology used to determine discount rates for ERISA contributions that was put in place with the MAP-21 legislation.","That methodology was an attempt to recognize the unprecedented low interest environment we were experiencing, which would have required making significant cash contributions to pension plans. The impact of the MAP-21 methodology decreases each year and would have phased out by 2016.","Under HATFA, this methodology will now be extended so that it will begin to decrease in 2018 and phase out by 2021. It has the effect of lowering CAS cost as well as ERISA contributions from what they otherwise would have been, had MAP-21 not been extended.","As you will see the impacts of these changes are somewhat mixed. They result in reduced pension funding requirements in the near term but also low recovery of pension contributions as it lowers our CAS cost in the near term. And while lowering near-term CAS cost improves our overall competitiveness and lowers the required level of customer funding, it also will lower our reported earnings per share in the near term.","I\u2019ll get into more specific detail of these impacts on the next page but overall we think these changes provide relatively neutral economic impact while having a negative impact on near-term GAAP earnings.","Chart seven provides more detail into how the HATFA changes will affect our pension recovery and funding requirements over the next three years. And these projections are based on the underlying assumptions for our pension plan as shown on chart 14 in our appendix web charts.","Focusing on the column labeled before HATFA, we were expecting to recover more than $7 billion through our CAS pricing between 2015 and 2017. We also would have had $3.5 billion in required contributions over that same period resulting in a net $3.8 billion in pre-tax pension cash recoveries.","As you can see in the column labeled after HATFA, we now expect to have CAS pension receipts of $5.8 billion while reducing our required pension contributions to $1 billion over this time period resulting in a net $4.8 billion in pre-tax pension recoveries. As you\u2019ll see in a couple of charts, we intend to make this required $1 billion contribution in the fourth quarter of 2014, creating a three-year pension funding holiday and allowing additional cash deployment opportunities to shareholders over the next three years.","The bottom two bullets on the chart describe what these changes mean relative to approximately $10 billion of pension pre-funding amount. By 2017, we will have recovered just under $5 billion of that amount and by 2020, we will have recovered a total of just over $8 billion. With this level of pension recoveries, we would expect our cash from operations to be greater than or equal to $15 billion over the 2015 to 2017 timeframe.","On chart eight, we provided our updated outlook for 2014. We\u2019re maintaining our orders outlook for the year while we\u2019re ahead of our orders planned for the first three quarters. We have the large C-130J multiyear order planned in the fourth quarter which could slip into 2015.","We\u2019re providing point estimates for those sales and segment operating profit as we\u2019re increasingly comfortable with our ability to achieve these levels. And both of these are above the midpoints of our prior guidance.","We also provided our usual sales and segment operating profit outlooks by business area in the appendix to our web charts today. Our FAS\/CAS pension income is lower by about $70 million as previously discussed. But we now expect our other unallocated expenses to be lower by similar amount resulting in $5.6 billion of operating profit.","We are now guiding our earnings per share to the high end of our previous guidance at $11.15 per share which includes the negative impact of $0.14 per HATFA. And with the additional $1 billion contribution to our pension trust this year, our cash from operations is now expected to be greater than or equal to $3.8 billion.","On chart nine, we provide our preliminary look at our 2015 financial trends. We expect our 2015 sales level will decline by a low single digit rate from our expected 2014 level, a little lower than we previously expected.","We had previously thought 2014 would represent the trough year of sequestration\u2019s effect on our topline. But that has now moved out a year as we continue to see downward pressure primarily in our services businesses.","We expect our segment operating margin will remain strong at between 11.5% and 12%. Our FAS\/CAS pension income rose to about $650 million in 2015, after the affects of the HATFA legislation. And assuming the discount rate remains at 4.25% at year-end 2014, our return on asset is 8% in 2014 and based on the additional $1 billion in incremental pension funding in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Again, that would allow for no required pension contributions from 2015 to 2017. Beyond 2015, with these same assumptions for our discount rate and return on assets, we would expect FAS\/CAS income to continue to grow to about a $1 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion by 2017. And because we are eliminating our previously plan $1 billion pension contribution in 2015, we anticipate increasing our share repurchases to at least $2 billion, about a $1 billion more than the level required to offset the amount of share creep expected during the year. This would be a good start reducing our share count level below 300 million share amount within the next three years that Marilyn mentioned earlier.","Finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance continues to be very solid. Our results leave us well-positioned to achieve the full year guidance we provided and we continue our long-standing commitment to returning cash to our shareholders.","With that, we are ready for your questions? Shannon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey. Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","A couple of quick ones. Just first on the sustainment weakness you called out in Aeronautics in the quarter. I wondered if you might give us some color about what that related to and whether that was tied to in-theater operations or something else.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. I will take that one, Carter. So the sustainment weakness in aero was really, I think of it is as predominantly F-16 or little bit in our Kelly business as well. The F-16, you should think of a couple of things going on there. We have a couple of large international F-16 month programs that are starting, but they started later than we had anticipated or they will start later in one case than we anticipated. And while we previously kind of expected to have some existing older mod programs, sort of feather end to these newer mod programs, we now have a bit of lowering point or a trough before we start to see the new programs pick up speed and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the numbers stand a little bit in F-16.","On the other hand for the F-22 program, this is a bit of good news, can also be bad news in some respects. We provide the sustainment of the F-22 aircraft in the field, and the aircraft are actually performing better than our expectation and I believe better than the customers\u2019 expectations. And so because of that because our readiness levels and the like are higher than we expected them to be at this point in time were actually seeing a diminished level of spares requirement, another sustainment activity to support the aircraft at that level. So while that\u2019s terrific news for our products, terrific news for our customers, does result in a little bit of lower sales for us in 2015 than we previously planned.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Hey Bruce, the question for you on the cash flow outlook over the next three years. You are going to do $3.8 billion this year which includes roughly $2 billion dollars in pension contributions that won't be there in the \u201815 through \u201917 period. That would suggest on average $5.8 billion and yet you are guiding on average $5 billion in cash flows, \u201915 through \u201918. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes that are going on with cash flow? Where might we really come on to or where we might we go over?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. Let me try to take a shot at that, Jason. So, I think you are -- the back of the envelope math you did would be exactly right. $3 billion with $2 billion pension contribution why wouldn\u2019t that equal $5.8 billion next year? So the short version answer to that is, think of that as primarily cash taxes. So the additional $1 billion that we are contributing in 2014 think about as about a $350 million swing that we won't get that tax deduction, if you will in 2015 and somewhat seems over at this point in time. But we also had a tax refund in the first quarter of this year about $250 million. So between the two of those, think of that as what $600 million-ish or so. I think we\u2019ve -- the one thing I would add that may help little bit in discussion also is while we are saying greater than or equal to $15 billion, we do expect 2015 cash flow to start with a $5 billion obviously at this point in time. But I would expect that year-over-year our cash from operations would actually increase over that number between \u201915, \u201916 and \u201917. So we are actually feeling good about the statement of greater than or equal to $15 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research. You may begin.","Rich Safran - Buckingham Research","Hi. Good morning.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Rich Safran - Buckingham Research","Let me ask you a different sort of question on cash flow here. Marillyn, I heard your opening remarks, may just want to get a little specific. Previously your stated goal was to return 50% of cash to shareholders. I recognized you\u2019ve been doing more than that but the $2 billion in share repurchases on the slide, plus the dividend indicates now you're looking closer towards 100%, assuming my math is correct here. So, I want to know if I\u2019m thinking about this right and does it represent a change in your cash deployment strategy? Should we be thinking now that you are going to return more like 100% of free cash flow to shareholders?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, you\u2019ve got the math exactly right, Rich. That is exactly how that totals up and so we are indicating to you that we are going to be returning more cash to the shareholders over the next few years. As Bruce just outlined, we are going to have good solid cash flow and so we intend to be -- as we look back, we have been providing more than 50% for the last few years but we intend to continue to do that. So we continue to expect, still expect to have strong dividends. We still -- as Bruce as outlined, we are progressing toward share level, outstanding shares of 300 million. Bruce, do you want to add anything to that?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah, Rich, maybe just a couple of moving pieces that may not be readily apparent there. So we have about -- we are probably in the year about 316 million shares or so outstanding. And so we also have, at the end of the year or as we sit here today about $6-ish million -- excuse me, 6 million options outstanding as well then we would expect to be exercised over the three year period. Plus as you know, we provide executive compensation, RSUs, plus matching our 401(k)s and the like that will probably add another 10 million shares or so.","So if you just think of it in terms of what the absolute number of shares would have to be there, it\u2019s probably the 16 million shares to get down to 300 plus, some of the creep we just talked about so. At least as we look at, we look at our operating cash flow over the next three years, I think your math is pretty much spot on. It does pretty much require us to do about a 100% of free cash flow over the next three years and that would be our intention.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Marillyn Hewson","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Bruce, if I assume every segment, except IS&GS, has the same topline rate of change in \u201915 versus \u201914, as it did in \u201914 versus \u201913. I would need IS&GS to be down about 10% just to get the total company down 1% and the low-single digit comment suggest, it could be more than 1%. Is that kind of the rate number for IS&GS next year? Or is there another segment that is incrementally worse than what you previously thought for \u201915? And if you could just give a little detail on why IS&GS is still dragging at that kind of decline?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So let me give -- maybe just go around try to touch on all five business areas at least at the topline, Noah, because I think you are not quite right in the way you did the math to come up with that number.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Bruce Tanner","So I think IS&GS, if we look at \u201915, it\u2019ll probably be down mid-single digits, maybe slightly more than that. And that\u2019s probably pretty evenly split between our civil and the defense and intelligence lines of business there. And what we\u2019re seeing there is, this is a portion of our portfolio that has always been -- I should start with that, but always has been and seemingly has gotten increasingly competitive in nature to the point where we\u2019re even seen sort of our follow-on contracts where we\u2019re the incumbent and we won the follow-on contract. Those are being awarded at lower levels than the prior contract were being awarded at.","We are also seeing the disaggregation of some contract opportunities and the sort of multiple elements of that contract that enable additional competition. So that\u2019s a little different environment than we had expected to be in, as we\u2019re trying to forecast what 2015 would look like a year ago, but that\u2019s the reality of where we are today. I think the piece that you\u2019re probably missing a little bit is, we are going to be down somewhat in Missiles and Fire Control, probably more than you\u2019re expecting.","So Missiles and Fire Control see in total is probably going to be down about a similar amount like, maybe a little bit less than IS&GS and most of that is because we do have a pretty good size services business within the Missiles and Fire Control or technical services business. And that is also experiencing the similar sort of hypercompetitive elements that we are seeing over an IS&GS and so that\u2019s going down. We are also down slightly or expect to be down slightly in 2015 in our air missile defense volume. This is both PAC-3 and THAAD. And that\u2019s just simply reflecting the lower quantities of missiles that were left a couple of years ago if you will kind of in the sequestration timeframe that are playing out in 2015.","I think Aeronautics is probably, and I think you got this right, Aeronautics is probably pretty comparable to where we will finish 2014, although that\u2019s probably a little lower than we had expected it to be primarily for the reasons that I described to Carter\u2019s question. I will point out that may not be clear. We are down. We always were expecting to be down in Aeronautics for F-16 deliveries from about 17 in 2014 to about 11 or so, so think of that is like one a month of F-16 deliveries next year. And that combined with the sustainment activity I mentioned the Carter is the reason that we are actually seeing a flat, I'll try to make this simpler before my voice quivers here, that we are making a flat year-to-year situation was what sort of lost and all that as we have a pretty significant reduction in SDD on the F-35 program, but the F-35 production program is drawing a faster than a 10% rate from 2014 to 2015.","Space is down slightly. Next year you should think about as sort of low-single digits, that\u2019s primarily because we had two launch vehicles that we recognized the sales for in 2014. We will have no such launch vehicles in 2015. We also had slightly lower government -- we actually have one launch vehicle, but we also have the Orion ETF, which is yet to take place that will take place in December of this year. So that\u2019s a higher volume for Orion as well compared to 2015.","We also have lower government satellite volume expected next year, and that\u2019s partially offset by the volume from our Zeta acquisition, but net, net Space is still down. And then lastly, the one kind of outlier in all that discussion is MST. And we are actually expecting MST to have potentially a little bit higher sales, maybe a low single digit to higher than last year and you should think of that is primarily because of the new start activity on some of our programs, such as the spacecraft program, the combat rescue helicopter and the presidential helicopter. So hope that gives you a little more added color there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","I would like to hone in on the F-35. It looks like your margin on the LRIP contracts in aggregate was down a little bit year-on-year for the second straight quarter. I was just wondering if you could highlight kind of what your expectations are there. Is there any risk reduction activity possible in Q4 and going into next year? And maybe just more qualitatively comment on what\u2019s happening? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Joe, I will take a shot at that. So I think the primary reason that F-35 looks that way is we actually had some risk retirements in the year before that were not replicated in 2014. And we are obviously booking those now at the higher rate that resulted from those step-ups in 2013, but we have no similar level of step-ups in 2014. Actually as we look at 2015, I think the F-35 production volume in part because we do expect to make some step-ups next year that we didn\u2019t have in 2014. We would expect to see the production volume or production return on sales actually increase next year as opposed to decrease.","So we are slowly getting there and it\u2019s a bit of a slog to kind of go, take a program as large as F-35 from a development to a low rate initial production to a full rate production program, but we\u2019re getting there. And those step-ups depend on risk retirement events and the phasing of those things changes practically with every single lot. I am happy that we just finished all the F-35 LRIP-5 deliveries and we are going to start delivering LRIP-6 aircraft this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","On Missiles and Fire Control, when you look at the next year and backlogs were down in this quarter. You talked about the service part of this, but if you look at the sort of the broader business, both not service, but both the US and international since that\u2019s a big part of it. Can you talk about how the backlogs look for those pieces? And if you\u2019re seeing the order flow come in and the timeframes that you would have expected to, are we going to see those parts of the business up some in 2015?","Bruce Tanner","Just to be clear Doug, are you talking Missiles and Fire Control by itself and sort of the international content there?","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Yes. Missiles and Fire Control, if you considered the services portion of it, the US equipment portion of it, and then the international part, how are those moving in terms of orders and when we should see the revenues from those orders?","Bruce Tanner","Yes. So Doug, as I said previously, the technical services piece is definitely going down and accordingly the backlog associated with business going down, that\u2019s almost all US dominated services, if you will. The international business is expecting to increase both backlog and sales going forward. We have already got. In fact, hopefully you saw there is -- today\u2019s announcement we had the turret contract for the UK Scout vehicle. This is a subcontract arrangement to actually our facility in the UK was awarded today, that\u2019s worth about a $1 billion, that will be recognized as an order in the fourth quarter.","We also had the PAC-3 order for the Government of Qatar that occurred in the quarter. It\u2019s already happened. And that\u2019s about a $0.5 billion. And as we look forward, there is slight a few international Air missile, defense activities. Those -- as you can well appreciate, those tend to be lumpy and little bit hard to predict, but we would expect backlog in Missiles and Fire Control to grow in \u201915 compared to \u201914 and we would continue to expect the international content both in terms of sales as well as backlog to grow from \u201914 to \u201915 as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. You may begin.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, I think if you could dive in a little bit about talking about the components of some of the margin erosion you\u2019re expecting to see next year at the segment level. Is this may be parse it out for us between how much of it is a sort of pricing issue with regard to sort of mix shift? Maybe the customers are renegotiating some fixed price contracts that are rolling off? Are you just going to take some more development work? Or is it more just sort of a volume driven through the efficiency issue?","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple deal to one of those, Hunter. So let me -- I probably should have done this but no one asked this question. But let me try to address that here with you. So we\u2019re guiding towards at least, the trend information that we provided, we said, we prior come between 11.5% and 12% next year. The biggest reason for that, the biggest single reason for that is we\u2019re expecting cost of about a $100 million of lower equity earnings from our United Launch Alliance joint venture.","And you should think of that as being probably about three or so fewer launch vehicles in 2015 compared to what was launched or what\u2019s expected to be launched in 2014. And it\u2019s also the mix of those vehicles, not every launch vehicle that gets launched by United Launch Alliance shares the same level of profitability. It depends on which vehicle and when that vehicle is actually contracted for.","So again, because of quantities of mix changes, think of that has been about $90 million lower. We\u2019re also seeing lower margin expectations back on the IS&GS from the competitive pressures that we talked about early on the sales discussion. So I would expect to see IS&GS margins down, probably 20, 30 basis point, somewhere in that range. About half a bit sort of due to competitive pressures that we see that are affecting the sales as well as the bottom line there.","And probably the other half is -- this is probably a little bit of good new story. The other half of margin pressure comes because we\u2019ve won quite a few large international multiyear contract. So think of this as programs like for the Australian Department of Defense we\u2019re providing the IT services for them. Think of it as a number of command-and-control programs for international customers.","And whereas, the vast majority of IS&GS business tends to be very short cycled in nature, these are a little bit more longer term contracts. And as you might expect, we\u2019ll start booking those contracts at lower profit rates in part because our new customers and they are longer duration contracts as well.","I\u2019ll also mention that we had about $50 million of higher expenses next year 2015 because of intangible amortization and transaction expenses associated with the deals that we\u2019re closing this year. And we also have within that $50 million, about $20 million or so of research and development expenses that are hitting the bottom line for Sun Catalytix R&D efforts. This is -- you may have read about this. This is sort of our energy storage pre-revenue kind of business that we acquired.","It does require some continuing R&D expenditures and this is non-far, non DOD business for the R&D hits the bottom line. So collectively again, between transaction expenses in Sun Catalytix about $50 million higher next year than last year. Despite that, I actually went back and looked at what we provided last year at this time. In last year for 2014, at this time we were guiding towards about 11.5%.","I\u2019ll say the same thing this year that I said last year, which as I look forward, I think we have similar levels of opportunity to do better as we did in 2014 as we said here looking at 2015. But we have to make those happen and that\u2019s the reason we have made those happen yet and we\u2019ll see how that progresses throughout the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Taking my question, Marillyn and Bruce. There is no doubt that Lockheed has a differentiated core competence in aerospace. And particularly if you assume that you win the Long-Range Strike Bomber like we do. But when you look out a few years, at certain point you have effectively tapped out of the organic growth opportunities that the air force so to speak has to offer.","And I wonder if you could talk a bit about how you see the shape of the company evolving in the longer term? Where do we find the growth from there? Do we start looking more closely at M&A, or do we evolve more into sort of a pure cash return vehicle? What\u2019s next?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, I think, as you talk about the outlook for aircraft and aerospace in general, it\u2019s still very positive for us. We\u2019re going to continue to see F-35 growth well into the future. I mean, we often talk about how it\u2019s very similar to the F-16 program. Today, we have a program of a record of over 3,000 aircraft and the F-16, we sold something like 4,600 of them and we still have continued demand for the F-16 and that\u2019s how we expect the F-35 to go.","So, well, there is a program of record with the U.S. government on the number of aircraft that they\u2019re going to buy. We have a lot of interested countries internationally that have yet to come online in that procurement process. A lot of partners as you know, eight partners around the world, now three SMSS customers with Israel, Japan and now South Korea and we expect additional customers. Plus some of those customers are early on and what their needs are and I expect that they will look at additional trenches of aircraft over time much that as they do with the F-16 program.","So we\u2019ll continue to be a strong aerospace company going forward into the future. They would be a major element of our business. Likewise, the missile defense arena is going to be a continued demand, that\u2019s a very important element of our business and there is strong demand internationally. Even as we look at our needs domestically, we expect there to be additional opportunities to use domestically but if you look at FAD, PAC-3, Aegis, Aegis Ashore, even MEADS we expect going forward.","Another area that we are moving into and have invested significantly and have a tremendous product for is the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, that\u2019s a big opportunity as we look forward. Littoral combat ship and the work that we\u2019re doing in that arena, there is interested international customers for that. In fact, we just launched the latest LCS at Marinette Marine this past week and we had international customers that attended that ceremony, so they\u2019re interested in our products.","We think there will be a demand for that as we go forward to C-130J. That aircraft continues to be in demand. We\u2019ve got a solid backlog of aircraft and we expect that they\u2019ll continue to be others. And now as we\u2019ve rolled out our commercial version, we expect those commercial customers that today are flying L-100s, to fly the LM-100J in the future. So that will -- we'll continue to look at variance of the C-130J, just as we have for many, many years going forward.","So, I kind of walk through on some of the top products in our portfolio. But as Bruce mentioned earlier, big opportunities in mission systems and components on various other platforms such as the combat rescue helicopter or the Presidential Helicopter, the MH-60 Romeo that we are selling around the world, that we do the mission systems for, out of our mission systems. Simulation and training continues to be a strong demand for that and overtime they will continue to be. And as you mentioned, our tuning with Boeing on the Long Range Strike-Bomber, we expect -- we are very well positioned to win that opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks so much. Marillyn, a question for you. There have been some comments out of DC that maybe the U.S defense industry is not investing enough its own money in R&D and perhaps returning too much money to shareholders. I\u2019m wondering if this is a comment that you have heard from your customer and how they might respond to your latest announcement today on the buyback.","Marillyn Hewson","Well. Yes, we have heard that from our customers that, a concern by our customer that we lose our technological superiority in this period of time when there are budget pesters and it\u2019s a down market. I would tell you from the Lockheed Martin standpoint, we have increased our R&D from last year to this year by 13%. We are going to increase another 5% this year or so and we will continue to. So we are at the highest percent of sales that we\u2019ve ever been in terms of our research and development and we will be hiring in 2015.","We will continue to invest. But I do think an open communication with our customer, especially in the Department of Defense is really important. And we are in constant dialog with them on what areas that we want to invest and how that aligns with what that they see as their priorities in the future. A lot of our products as you know require a lot of development on the front end such as F-35, or of course we look forward to JLTV that we talked about and a variety of them. So as we come out with products, we are constantly investing but we are investing in new technologies. We are looking at how do we help our customer get an advantage of our adversaries, we have things going on that we can\u2019t talk about on this call. But certainly there is a lot of investment in new materials and new capabilities that we think our customers will need.","So, yes, we are hearing it. And I think from the Department of Defense standpoint because they recognized that, I think they will in turn be looking at making sure that they invest in new technology and we expect to participate in that opportunity. We do cooperative research and development with universities and with other government labs as well. So when you look at our percent of IRAD, you have to add to that the things that we are doing there and collaborative CRAD type of things. We are -- we are major provider to DARPA. So the work that we do with DARPA is another example.","So when you total it all up, you can\u2019t just look at one number on the balance sheet. You have to take into account the type of work we do, the complexity of the products that we produce and how much research and development that takes on the front end in the development days as well as our independent research development and our work with DARPA and our CRAD.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping Bruce maybe you could touch on the profit adjustments, not related to volume and kind of what\u2019s baked into \u201815. It looks like maybe for this year, you will be running some where 32% to 33%. And then also if you can just clarify on the sustainability of unallocated expense being at this level? Thanks.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So, I think you are about right, Myles, I don\u2019t quite have the number on my head. But we were a little bit lower in the fourth quarter in terms of our profit adjustments. I would expect that we probably rebound a little bit at least as we look at the planning for the fourth quarter. I mean obviously those can move out if we don\u2019t sort of accomplish all the events that we hold to that result in those risk retirements. But as we look here today, we would expect to bounce back up a little bit and that was in the year at about the level you said I mean somewhere probably in the 33%, 34% of total profitability.","I would think next year is probably fairly comfortable. We kind of tossed out the 30% to 35% as sort of where we expect that we were a little bit higher than last year. But that\u2019s about what we expect to be going forward. And then as far as the other unallocated, I would not expect it to be quite at the level we are forecasting for this year in part because, I mean, there is a lot of moving pieces in that as you can well appreciate. Though we had some -- we had some question corporate costs that got resolved in our favor during the quarter. There was fairly the largest piece of those moving pieces and I would not expect that to replicate in future quarter so this is a bit of an outlier.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Ross Cowley - Credit Suisse","Good morning everybody. This is actually Ross on for Rob. I was just hoping to get a quick update on the expected timing for the signing of our patent F-35 and any other details you could provide regarding that contract?","Marillyn Hewson","Well, I\u2019ll update, we are progressing well in the negotiations. So I think that we expect to see a closure on that in the near term. It\u2019s for 43 aircraft is what, it\u2019s the number of aircraft in that lot. So we\u2019ll see larger number of aircraft in our update. We have -- its progressing very well and we had good discussion with the customer and we expect to conclude the negotiations in the near term.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. You may begin.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","","Yes. Thanks so much. So, Bruce if you could comment on aeronautical with respect to, I think you took a contract reserve in the third quarter and also may be update us on the C-130 deliveries this year and next year given there was a slip on the F-16 and the implications of that F-16 slip on profitability next year? Thanks so much.","Bruce Tanner","Yeah. So actually we had two. We said there are contract reserves that I probably better stated as sort of legal reserves. One was to resolve a legal matter and other was a sort of to create a provision for a legal matter. Two different -- two different items about the same quantity of each of them. So it totaled up $30 million in the quarter. I think we released that in the earnings release.","C-130 deliveries, we do expect to end the year about 24. We are going to run about 24 aircrafts build rates. And you could possibly have one slip here and there between years. But I don\u2019t expect that to happen in 2014. We are tracking well to that schedule. And I would 2015 would be a similar level at the 24 aircraft. And then I think your last question was on F-16 and most for the profitability of that because we are losing volume of aircraft quantities obviously the profit dollars associated with those aircraft quantities will go down. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a huge drop-off from margin perspective year-over-year because of that, I mean, the aircraft quantities that are being delivered, I still think we\u2019ll have comparable margins and the sustainment activity including the modern work that we do is also fairly comparable to the aircraft business that we have there. So it may not be as self evident as when the quantity drops, the profitability also drops or the profit and the margins also drops. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case there.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Hi, good morning.","Bruce Tanner","","Good morning.","George Shapiro - Shapiro","Little one\u2019s, I\u2019ll patch together, C-5 deliveries next year and do we get any chance of getting above the zero margin. And then on the F-35, if you could breakout revenues by the different LRIPs and if there is any international revenue starting to pick up next year?","Bruce Tanner","","Yes. George, I\u2019ll take that one. So C-5, we\u2019re expecting to increase the rate, you should -- I think we will do probably six, maybe seven C-5s this year. We\u2019re actually performing well in that program. I think we grow that number to about nine, expected deliveries next year, so we\u2019ll see some volume increases associated with them. I think there is a chance that we\u2019ll see some profitability increases, George, on that. We\u2019re performing much better as we performed throughout 2014 towards the end of the year than we were even at the start of the year. And assuming that trend sort of continues into 2015, I think that creates the possibility for that.","I think we talked on a pervious call about there is definitely some what we call over and above work that we think we\u2019ve entitlement to that we do believe we can get reimbursed at some point time, that is not yet played out. But we continue to believe we have that entitlement, which would allow more than what I\u2019m talking about just through I\u2019d say ordinary program performance improvements year-over-year. So I\u2019m feeling better about the program going into \u201815 than I was into 2014.","The international revenue on the F-35, it\u2019s -- the quantities are going and just roughly I think we kind of pulled out the number, it\u2019s a little bit out of off the top of my head, but we\u2019re probably somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in international revenue this year and we\u2019d probably expect to grow that number above $2 billion of the total F-35 revenue for next year. So it\u2019s growing at a fairly fast clip by itself. Again the program in total, the production program is growing more than 10% year-over-year from '14 to '15, so internationally we would expect to do that as well.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.","Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities","","Good morning, guys. It\u2019s Gary Liebowitz for Sam.","","Bruce Tanner","Hey, Gary","","Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities","","Couple of quick ones. Bruce, for your three-year cash flow outlook, how should we think of capital expenditures over that period?","Bruce Tanner","","Yeah. So you should think of those as being fairly similar to the level we had in 2014. Gary, we are right at around $1 billion between PP&E, capital expenditures and our capitalized software. And that\u2019s about the level we see in the future. It could be a little less than that, maybe a little more than that, but for planning purposes, think right at about $1 billion a year.","Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. And my second question and I apologize if you addressed it already. The sales outlook in Space that you took up to $7.9 billion this year, what was behind that increase?","Bruce Tanner","","Yeah. so we\u2019re getting -- again I think at the beginning of the year, we had probably little more conservatism for some of the later in the year delivery events that would have going to occur, including the Orion ETF launch which should be pretty spectacular by the way on December, in the early part of December this year.","So that now we feel highly confident that that\u2019s going to occur. That was one of the reasons we\u2019re probably little more conservative with our guidance early in the year. We had also made two acquisitions in the year, Zeta Associates which is the larger of two and Astrotech, which is little smaller, but we are getting additional revenue from both of those as well.","Jerry Kircher","Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we are coming up on the end, maybe one more question.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. You may begin.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel","","Hey, good morning.","Bruce Tanner","Hi, Joe.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel","Bruce, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about, given some of the budget uncertainty obviously we\u2019ve had over the past couple of years is, I think there is more confidence that that\u2019s bottoms out in '15. Does that change the way that you think from a cash deployment perspective kind of balancing the dividend, buyback and M&A, and clearly the M&A side hasn\u2019t been a big piece of it the past couple of years? Do you see that changing at all over the next few years?","Bruce Tanner","","Yeah. I sure help, Joe, that we do see the bottom out in 2015. We kind of teed up we thought that was going to occur in 2014 and we were at least a year off there. So as we look today, I think that we do expect that to sort of bottom out for us in 2015 and we get back to accretive growth in 2016. That\u2019s kind of what the budget would indicate. I\u2019m watching in particular the FY\u201916 budget request and whether or not they sort of stick within the sequestration levels or actually potentially based it more on the actual threats than the strategic direction that the DOD needs to go into. I think that\u2019s going to be an interesting one to watch.","As far how that plays relative to our cash deployment, I don\u2019t see that having any necessarily large impact on how we would think of cash deployment activities. I think we\u2019ve given a little more insight into that by what we talked about today with the higher share repurchases that we plan over the next three years at least. And as I always say with the dividends, I think our track record on dividends is the best indicator of what we\u2019ll do going forward. So I\u2019ll probably leave it at that and turn the call back over to Marillyn at this point.","Marillyn Hewson","","Thanks, Bruce. We will just wrap up now. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and just conclude by reiterating that the Corporation had another solid quarter. And we continue to be well-positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and shareholders, as we progress towards a successful closure of 2014. So thanks again for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call in January. Shannon, that concludes our call today.","","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect."]}}
