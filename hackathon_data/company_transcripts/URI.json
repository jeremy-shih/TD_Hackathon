","Speaking today for United Reynolds is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jessica Graziano, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.","Matthew Flannery","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Let's start with full year 2019. It was a solid year of profitable growth for United Rentals, both organically and through the impact of our acquisitions, and we expect to deliver more growth again this year. We're continuing to gain ground in a cycle that's not without its challenges, but one that we think has legs in 2020. And you saw that reflected in the guidance we released yesterday. ","In many ways, 2019 was a year of transition for us. Now we've lapped the large acquisitions, and we have a clean slate and a much greater platform for growth. To recap the full year highlights. Both our revenue and earnings were up year-over-year as reported and also pro forma. We delivered record EBITDA of $4.4 billion and a record free cash flow of $1.6 billion. ","On the flip side, there were some stubborn headwinds that impacted our numbers. When we look at the fourth quarter specifically, we had some rough spots. We knew rental revenue growth would moderate, but Q4 pro forma growth was lower than expected at around 1%. And some of our costs were higher. This created a drag on our margins. ","The single biggest constraint was a slowdown in upstream oil and gas. Within our rental operations, it impacted not just revenue, but also our operating costs. We spoke about this last quarter, and Jeff will discuss the impact in detail, including the expenses we had for repair, maintenance and repositioning of the fleet that we pulled back from the oilfield. We're sending that equipment to other markets where it can generate revenue down the road. We didn't have grand expectations for the upstream market. But frankly, the speed of the decline was a surprise. ","We expect the demand to stabilize early this year, although year-over-year, the comps will remain tough for a couple of quarters. If I had to point to 1 metric where we were most disappointed in overall is fleet productivity. Our biggest opportunity to repair productivity in 2020 is with fleet absorption. We have the assets in place and the team is focused on getting excess capacity out on rent in a disciplined manner as activity ramps up. ","Based on what we're hearing from our customers and the field organization, we're confident that the demand will be there. On the subject of fleet, I want to take a minute to comment on the CapEx ranges in our guidance. Our plan calls for $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion of gross CapEx this year. The low end of that range represents our expected maintenance CapEx and the top end accommodates growth as the year plays out. This would most likely be used for specialty fleet or equipment for specific projects. ","Broadly speaking, the last 3 months have helped confirm both the weakness and the strength we see in the cycle. We had a couple of regions hurt by oil and gas and a couple of others with strong increases in rental revenue, driven by large infrastructure projects and nonres activity. Aside from those, our regions were generally slightly up or slightly down. ","Our specialty segment had another strong quarter. Rental revenue from Trench Power and Fluid Solutions combined grew almost 9%, and about half of that was organic. The highest growth came from our Power & HVAC business. This year, we'll continue to invest in specialty with another 25 cold-starts planned across our service offering and that's following 34 we added in 2019. And this will bring our specialty network close to 400 locations by year-end. Our ongoing investments in specialty are part of our broader strategy to differentiate our service offering. ","Customers see us as a solutions provider, not just an equipment rental company. In 2019, we made strategic investments in growth initiatives that we believe can be highly accretive long term. And we'll continue to invest in the business this year, even though it may have a short-term impact on our margins. ","Now here's where we come out on the landscape looking forward. We believe that our construction markets will continue to grow through 2020, but not at the same rate as 2019. With industrial, our base case assumes more of the same sluggish activity. Our industrial revenue in 2019 was essentially flat with '18. If we exclude the impact of upstream oil and gas, industrial was up 3% for the year. ","I can sum up our expectations for this year in 4 words: Slowing but still growing. And this jives with a number of external data points including our most recent customer confidence index. It's at the highest point since August. Construction backlogs are stable. The December ABI came in above 50 again and the CEO confidence remains strong. ","The combination of these indicators help shape our outlook. But we're not taking anything for granted. If conditions change, we have a lot of flexibility built into our business model. Our job now is to unlock the value of this big engine we've built. I made that comment on the third quarter call, and it was a theme for our annual management meeting this month. ","We had more than 2,000 leaders in Minneapolis to kick off the year. They came away with concrete plans to achieve our goals and a powerful platform to do it with. Not just fleet and branches, but also digital capabilities specialized solutions and most importantly, our talent base. Our people are the #1 reason I can say with confidence. While no company can control the operating environment, we do have the ability to continuously improve our performance from the inside out. That's our mantra. Bigger doesn't really matter unless we're constantly driving for better. ","Also, I want to give a shout out to our team on safety performance. They delivered another year with a total recordable rate below 1, despite the noise of the multiple integrations. Finally, I want to speak to our stewardship of United Rentals on behalf of all stakeholders. The priority of our leadership team is to manage the business for the optimal balance of growth, margin, returns and free cash flow. ","In 2020, we're looking at another year of profitable growth and strong cash generation. We plan to use that cash in ways that will benefit our investors. First, we'll continue to invest in strategic initiatives that we believe have long-term accretive value. Second, we're planning to use about $1 billion to pay down debt. And yesterday, we announced a new share repurchase program that will return an estimated $500 million to our investors over the next 12 months. ","We have a lot of flexibility in the ways we can serve our stakeholders. The constant is that we're a disciplined, resilient company with a focus on driving returns in any environment. That's what our investors expect, and that's what we'll deliver. With that, I'll ask Jess to walk you through the quarter, and then we'll go to Q&A. So Jess, over to you.","Jessica Graziano","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. There's a lot to cover this morning, so let's jump right into the fourth quarter results, starting with rental revenue. On an as-reported basis, our rental revenue grew 3.7% or $73 million to just over $2.06 billion. Adjusting for BlueLine on a pro forma basis, rental revenue was up 0.8% for the quarter or about $14 million. ","Within rental revenue, as reported OER growth contributed $62 million of the $73 million increase. Ancillary revenue was up about $15 million and re-rent revenue decreased by 4. Here's a breakdown of the $62 million or 3.7% OER growth. We had growth in our fleet of 7.6%, which translates into $127 million of additional revenue. Fleet inflation cost us 1.5% or $25 million and fleet productivity on an as-reported basis was down 2.4% or a decrease of $40 million. I'll mention that year-over-year, fleet productivity on a pro forma basis was down 1.8%. Time utilization remained a headwind in the quarter, and the combined benefit we've had in rate and mix were not enough to offset the impact of lower time. That's rental revenue. Let's move to used sales. ","Used sales revenue was up 31% or $58 million year-over-year. That represents $154 million more fleet sold at OEC. The environment continues to be strong with overall proceeds as a percentage of OEC of about 52%. That number climbs to 56%, if I exclude the auction sales we had in Q4. Sales at retail made up over 2\/3 of sales in the quarter as we sold 40% more fleet through this healthy retail channel versus last year. ","Adjusted gross margin on used sales in the quarter was 43%, down from 51% in Q4 last year. That decline is mainly due to more auction sales of fleet with high operating hours, including units from the oil patch as well as a 4% decline in retail pricing we experienced, given the increased volume that we sold through that channel in Q4. ","Taking a look at EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just over $1.15 billion, an increase of $37 million or 3% year-over-year. And here's a breakdown of the as-reported changes. In rental, OER contributed $7 million. Ancillary benefited adjusted EBITDA by $2 million. Re-rent was a decrease of 7. Used sales added $11 million to EBITDA, and better performance in our other lines of business provided $3 million. SG&A helped adjusted EBITDA by $21 million year-over-year. And I'll note there, that includes the impact of debt, and we also recognized about $6 million in synergies year-over-year from the BlueLine stub period. ","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, which is down 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA flow-through was approximately 25%. Both margin and flow-through were impacted this quarter by a number of dynamics. First, and most importantly, was the slower rate of growth realized in the fourth quarter in large part due to the decline in the upstream end markets. As we've said before, our ability to reach our targeted levels of flow through requires a combination of positive fleet productivity in revenue and cost productivity gains. ","At 0.8% pro forma rental revenue growth, which includes negative fleet productivity, the margin and flow-through were challenged, given slow growth in the quarter and our maintaining a cost structure that supports the capacity we expect to need to service growth in 2020. We also continued to make investments in growth initiatives that will drive value in the future. ","Second, our cost base was stressed by repair and repositioning costs coming out of continued declines in the upstream markets. I mentioned in the third quarter call that some of those additional costs would play out through the fourth quarter, and they did at around $8 million. Line of business mix was another headwind in flow-through. The fourth quarter included a sizable increase in used equipment sales as well as growth in our nonrental lines of business, all of which are dilutive to margin and flow-through this period. ","A comment on adjusted EPS. We delivered a strong $5.60 in the quarter compared with $4.85 in Q4 of 2018. That's an increase of 15%, primarily from better operating performance, lower shares outstanding and tax benefits that we recognized in Q4. ","Let's move to CapEx and free cash flow. For the full year, we brought in $2.13 billion in gross CapEx, with $158 million of that having come in during the fourth quarter. Excluding $831 million in proceeds from used sales, net rental CapEx for 2019 was $1.3 billion. We generated robust free cash flow in 2019, about $1.6 billion for the year or an increase of $258 million from 2018. That's up over 19% and adds back about $26 million in merger and restructuring payments we made last year. ","Our tax adjusted ROIC remains strong, coming in at 10.4% for the fourth quarter. That continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital, which currently runs south of 8%. Year-over-year, tax adjusted ROIC was down 60 basis points, due in part to the decline in margin this quarter and, to a lesser extent, as a result of the expected drag from our acquisitions. ","Looking at the balance sheet. Net debt at December 31 was $11.4 billion, which is $300 million lower than last year. Leverage at the end of the year was 2.6x, that's down 10 basis points from the end of the third quarter and down 50 basis points for the full year. And a quick comment on liquidity, which at year-end was a very strong $2.14 billion, comprised mainly of ABL capacity. ","A few comments on capital allocation and our share repurchase programs. We completed our $1.25 billion repurchase program, purchasing $200 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Our 2019 purchases under that program reduced the total share count by about 7%. As Matt mentioned, we will prioritize the use of our excess free cash flow towards reducing leverage in 2020. We're targeting $1 billion towards debt reduction this year, and I'll speak to guidance in a minute. But based on the strength of the free cash flow we expect to generate this year, we also expect to return additional cash to shareholders through a new $500 million share repurchase program that will complete over the next 12 months. ","I'll wrap up with a few comments on guidance. Our 2020 outlook was included in our release last night. First, we expect 2020 will be another year of growth in this cycle, albeit slower growth. Our guidance for low single-digit growth in total revenue assumes continued support from our construction end markets as well as certain industrial verticals while working through tough comps from oil and gas in the first half of the year. ","We're focused on increasing fleet productivity and our plan sees positive fleet productivity for the full year. But to be clear, we'll likely continue to see some challenges in a seasonally slower Q1, closely managing our CapEx as we continue to reposition fleet in advance of the busier start of the season in Q2. ","We expect to sell more used equipment in 2020 as we leverage what is still a strong used market. And we'll keep our fleet refreshed with approximately $1.9 billion of inflation-adjusted replacement CapEx. That's at the bottom end of our growth CapEx range. We'll add growth capital in 2020, primarily in support of our specialty businesses, but we'll look to adjust CapEx accordingly as we monitor demand and look first to utilize the fleet we already have in the field. ","Our outlook includes low single-digit growth for adjusted EBITDA as well this year. Cost management remains a focus for us, and it's balanced with continued investment in areas we know will generate better customer service and shareholder value over the longer term, like in our specialty cold-starts, the build-out of our services businesses and our digital platforms. ","Finally, while we continue to invest in growth, we'll also generate higher free cash flow this year, the majority of it earmarked for debt reduction and the new share repurchase program. So with that, let's move on to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.","David Raso","I think the [indiscernible] is the fleet productivity for '20. The credibility of the guide that it can be positive. Jess, can you least take us through a little bit the thoughts on cadence. You mentioned at the early part of the year, it's still a struggle of productivity and it seems that the key metric really is the fleet utilization within that productivity number. Can you give us some sense, do you expect fleet productivity to be positive year-over-year as early as 2Q? Or is it more 3Q? Just some sense of what kind of ramp do we need to see. And then really, particularly in fleet utilization to give us confidence fleet productivity can be positive for the year.","Matthew Flannery","David, good question. This is Matt. I would say we're no better at predicting fleet productivity than we were late [indiscernible] time, to be frank. But when we do have a lot more, right, three levers combined in the two, in the one versus the two and then mix. So we think that we've been very explicit that fleet absorption is going to be the greatest opportunity. The only reason why we're talking about that it will take some time is because it's not going to be a light switch. But we think the combination of our rigorous management of it, some easier comps, quite frankly, as we get through the back half of the year is going to make it accelerate. But I wouldn't necessarily take that at Q1 or Q2 as positive or negative. Just that we feel it will improve throughout the year. We do feel -- I mean, if this guidance holds up, these end markets hold up, everything that we firmly believe in, it implies fleet productivity being positive. It almost have to. So we do we do feel firm on that.","David Raso","Would you say it'd be fair, Matt, to say that CapEx, especially the cadence, no less, if the fleet productivity is proving to be challenging as you get further into 1Q into the key spring selling season. You will look back -- look to -- sorry, pull back on the net CapEx because that's more of the focus this year is making sure that the utilization improves?","Matthew Flannery","Absolutely great. That's an absolutely accurate and great point, and that's why you see a broader range this year in CapEx guidance than we normally have because where we end up in that range. Obviously, demand will play a part in it. But this year, specifically, absorption will play a part and how well we do in absorbing the fleet. So that's why you see that broader range. So that's the right way to think about.","David Raso","And I guess my last question, I mean, what we can debate the credibility can get fleet productivity to be positive. But if you believe you can, the incremental EBITDA margins for the year seem very low. I mean, you basically have 38% incremental EBITDA margins and if fleet utilization is getting close to flat to allow fleet productivity to be positive? I'm struggling with so many costs in 2019, right, $12 million in the last quarter alone on oil and gas, $8 million now in the fourth quarter, oil and gas hit. I mean, that's $20 million of costs you would think wouldn't repeat. And if you pull that out of the guidance, I mean, you're talking about almost no EBITDA incremental on the revenue growth. So I'm just trying to square up, if you really believe you can get fleet productivity positive, why would the incrementals with all those costs not repeating be this week?","Matthew Flannery","So I'll -- Jess, I think, did a great job breaking down some of the issues in her prepared remarks, and I'd love Jess to comment in a minute, but I would -- the most obvious ones to slow growth, right? So it's just having to absorb both the natural inflation of the business when you're in a low single-digit environment, but also some of the choices we're making to continue to lean in to making sure we're building out capacity for some of our other initiatives. If we were managing for a quarter, maybe you wouldn't make those investments. We're certainly not or we don't think anybody want us to so it's just a little bit of headwind from those two, but slow growth is the main driver. Jess, I don't know if you want to add any more color.","Jessica Graziano","Yes. I think the only thing I'd add is that there's really two other dynamics that are playing through. One is those comps in the first half for upstream, right? We really -- we saw in 2019 that the rig count in the upstream business really started to decline in the third quarter of '19, right? So we need to comp that through the first half. The other thing is we're going to continue to make the investments that I mentioned, right, continue to build out some of our services business that frankly, come in with lower margins. They're not as asset intensive, so the returns are really good in those lines. But in building those up off of a low base, right, there's going to be some investment that we're going to continue to make in building those businesses out. The other is continuing to invest in cold-starts that also need time to build up and build out and some of the digital capabilities that we're going to continue to grow and lean into in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Two questions. I guess, can you just talk about what your assumptions are for disposing of used equipment in 2020. Do you expect to continue to use the auction channel as much as you did in 2019 -- here at the end '19? And then my follow-up question is just on these oil and gas markets, the energy markets, are you seeing any kind of knock-on effect as of this point in more traditional construction equipment?","Matthew Flannery","No problem, Seth. So first answer for the auctions. No, we think this year, with all this fleet that we're pulling out of the oil and gas and some of the excess capacity we had through the BlueLine acquisition. We had more than our usual by quite a bit of really tired old fleet, and it was just the appropriate decision. I probably did 4 or 5x more the options we have in any other year we have but we're not going to sell that type of fleet to our customers. It's just -- we're just not going to do that. I think the good news is that -- and Jess pointed to this in her prepared remarks, the end market for used equipment retail was really strong. And so we'll continue to push that lever. We think that's a unique strategy that separates us and our returns and our ability to get the high proceeds per CapEx dollar per OEC dollar. And we'll continue to focus on that. The only thing we'll send to auctions are stuff that we're just not going to sell to our customers. ","On the oil and gas, we're not really seeing a knock-on effect broadly, like you may have in 15 because all that infrastructure was already built around it. What we are seeing, though, is that 31% drop in Q4, brought us to a 16% drop in upstream oil and gas full year. That was significant. And you saw a little bit of that drag on midstream as well. Those are the 2 areas that frankly surprised us at the -- how fast they decelerated. Within our embedded guidance, we're thinking of maybe another 10% drop in the year. So we're not counting on oil and gas to recover and we don't feel there's going to be any broad knock-on effect as a result.","Seth Weber","And do you feel like you've finish the moves and the relocation of the fleet out of those markets at this point? Or is there still more equipment that needs to come out? I mean, do you -- can you just -- can you characterize your utilization levels in the energy markets relative to where you want them to be?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. So if you think about the cadence of $12 million in Q3, $8 million in Q4, I think that cadence will continue. We don't expect to see a big drag probably -- hopefully, one that we wouldn't even call out in Q1. Now to be fair, if it drops a lot more than 10%. I mean, it's only 3.7% of our business right now. So we think we're appropriately sized there. If you take 10% off of that, that's still not a big number. And then the repairs on that shouldn't need to be a call out. The only reason you hear me say caveat is because I didn't expect it in Q4. But we don't really expect to have a big number in 2020 for repair and repositioning in oil and gas.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wartheimer from Melius.","Robert Wertheimer","Can I just ask a similar question, a little bit bigger picture versus what has been asked already. I mean, if you look at our EBITDA margins over the past 4, 5 years, and they're higher than today and you've absorbed, obviously, a tremendous amount of growth. And some asset mix changes too, I guess, [indiscernible] and other things. So leaving aside the vagaries of this year, do you believe you're intrinsic EBITDA margin potential is higher than today? Or is this the right level and you grow by capital redeployment from here?","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Rob. I think it's a great point. It really depends on how fast some of our other businesses grow. Generally, we feel like this is a kind of EBITDA margin we can continue to drive longer-term and maybe even improve upon as we get some of these lower-margin businesses that we bought over the years to improve. I would say that the only thing that we're really focused on is as we build out these service businesses, there's not -- they're very asset light. So there's not a lot of -- it's not as high an EBITDA margin, but really good returns. I think it's too early for us to worry about that now, but I'm just -- as I'm projecting, to your point, a higher thinking longer-term question. EBITDA margin could dilute and returns could be higher, theoretically. This depends on how fast we grow some of these asset-light and service businesses, but we're going to be in this ballpark, we feel around this area for a while.","Robert Wertheimer","And then just -- we've chatted about this in the past, but how long does it take to get BlueLine fully up and operational at sort of your eye levels? Is it a year, two years, three or four years you're still seeing benefits? Like how do you think about that?","Matthew Flannery","So I think that all the sales challenges and repairs are pretty much done external facing. And that's what I meant when I say clean slate. So I think as we get through the seasonal build this year, get past some of the comps that Jess has been talking about for the first half of the year on oil and gas. I think we're in pretty good shape. As an organization, including the themes that came from blue one. When you're thinking about some of the legacy acquired shops. I'll point to -- I think we played a video a couple of years ago at Investor Day, where we had the branch manager from Boston. Did a real good job talking about year 1. They were just drinking from a fire hose and all the new tools. In year 2, they really started to comprehend how to utilize them. And then in that third year is where they ramp up. So if I take that -- I take the BlueLine maybe they're a little bigger company, maybe they're even faster than learners. But I think that when we really think about the full maturity of productivity out of those acquired stores. Sometime in the back half of this year, '21. I don't know when exactly. I think they're really catching on to the tools and being able to focus on utilizing them at scale, which is really the difference that we've done here in our legacy United stores. The scale is new to a lot of folks outside of our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.","Joseph O'Dea","First question is just on CapEx and implied growth range of flat to up $300 million. It seems like based on the specialty growth targets that you revised recently, you should be at least at the midpoint of that, if not higher. And so I don't know if it implies that the gen rent fleet, if anything could even shrink this year. And so just how you're thinking about that path of specialty growth and then maybe what's implied in terms of gen rent fleet thinking?","Matthew Flannery","Sure. So as I had answered -- I think it was David who asked the question first. We're going to -- where we end up in that range depends on how fast we absorb. And that absorption is really primarily in the gen rent business. So you're active -- we are going to fund our specialty growth. When I think about -- at the midpoint, that's probably in the range of between the cold-starts and the organic growth that we're driving through the specialty team will need to fund over and above the replacement CapEx. So we're not really guiding to that we will shrink generate. Unless all of the demand can be filled with the latent capacity. We're not betting on that. We're not even hoping for that, but it is a fair observation. So I don't think that, that 1 9 -- if we have to use some of that 1.9 because we're not absorbing as fast to buy some specialty assets, that is what we will do.","Joseph O'Dea","And then on the time side of things, just trying to understand a little bit better why that's surprised in the quarter. A lot of attention on oil and gas. I mean, was it all oil and gas? Or were there other things that you saw develop over the course of the quarter that wound up shaking out just a little bit differently from what you anticipated in, say, end of October?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. So oil and gas is certainly a big driver. But to your point, the back half of Q4, what we've called -- lovingly called the Turkey drop. For my 29 years, I never get used to how much we drop that Thanksgiving. A little bit steeper than we usually do. That was transient. We feel comfortable that repairs as we sit here and guide here as today. We obviously feel comfortable that, that will repair. And that was -- those were the 2 major contributors. What we're encouraged about is that you see that the OEMs backlog seems to be that the industry is responding to that little bit of a slower growth. So think about everybody's been building their fleets for this high single digit, double-digit growth. It's appropriate for people to take a pause and absorb. So that really shows me good discipline from the industry overall, and I think that's a big part of the confidence we have that we'll be able to repair the time utilization in 2020.","Joseph O'Dea","And that's -- just a question on the fleet productivity because my impression from your comments there is that it wasn't a matter of you might have been a little bit more disciplined on the rate side of things and suffered on the utilization side of things but the industry at large would probably be trending with the kind of rate experience that you had.","Matthew Flannery","I don't really know. I can't -- I don't want to say that because we don't know that answer what the industry is doing. What I can say and thanks for giving me the opportunity to reiterate. Our opportunity to drive time utilization is because we're going to drive it through 1 or 2 ways: More fleet on rent or better discipline on the inflow. It's not because we're, if any change in strategy that we're going to trade-off any kind of rate to get higher time utilization. That is not the goal at all. We think it's important to continue to have rigorous rate management to go forward as we absorb inflation. So I think this is just more about as the growth decelerates to lower single to mid-single digits. It's just appropriate that, that pace the industry paces. And I think that's what I was referring to the backlogs that you're seeing from the OEMs being down year-over-year is a good response.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if we could just expand on the specialty discussion. At the specialty day, I think we spoke about 32 cold-starts plant for '20, which if we look at the midpoint of the CapEx guidance range, the entirety of $300 million of growth CapEx would be accounted for by specialty. So I just want to make sure that we have those pieces right. And if there are any other moving pieces we should keep in mind relative to what we spoke about at the specialty day. Would love an update.","Matthew Flannery","Yes. So glad you viewed that. I heard that was very widely and broadly enjoyed from the investment community. And Paul and the team did a good job. I would say we've got that number right now, take, for $25 whether it's accelerates, we'll have a lot to do with -- actually, CapEx will be the last part of the decision we are we getting the facilities of people that we need to accelerate it to maybe a goal of above 30, as we did, frankly, in '19, we increased the amount from what we originally thought. So this is no change in the overall strategy. But just to be clear, the number that we're focused on right now is 25 cold-starts planned for '20, and that may lessen that CapEx need more to the $200 million range as the way we're thinking about it right now. That will be prioritized because, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is a differentiator for us. And solving more customers' problems, we think, is a real part of why people do business with United Rentals. So no change in strategy, just numerically might be a little bit less than what you may remember from the specialty day.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then as you folks have used more and more data analytics. A, can you just talk about the decision for CapEx for '19 to come in at the high end of the prior guidance range because if we have CapEx at the low end of the guidance range, time -- you would be 50, 60 basis points stronger and obviously, you folks made those decisions in the field on a case-by-case basis. But any comments that you can make and I appreciate the seasonality comment post Thanksgiving. But any additional context because given the time you pressure, I guess, we would have thought CapEx would be at the low end of the guide.","Matthew Flannery","Yes. So unfortunately, and we joke about this internally a little bit. I can't cut up a 60-foot boom and create generators and light towers. I will tell you that when we look at the fourth quarter CapEx, which we manage very tightly we had a significant amount, almost 25% of that was just our HVAC assets. So between leaders, temporary power, stuff like that. So that probably would be in the range of -- with the math that said $50 million, $100 million less, if it was just -- if we weren't bringing in assets that where we had some time utilization opportunity. It was more -- the mix of assets that we're bringing from -- for different businesses and to support. As to your question earlier, our specialty growth and some seasonal items as well.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, on the cadence, as we look at the time you in the second quarter of '19, it was, call it, 150 basis points lower than normal seasonality versus the first quarter. So it does look like you could potentially turn the corner for fleet productivity in the second quarter of '20. I just want to make sure we're not up over our skis with that thought process. Any comments that you can share on that?","Matthew Flannery","No. I think you're directionally correct, how the mix comes in, right? We talk a lot about time the mix will be a component of it as well. But as long as we do think that we have that opportunity and we think our guys kind of embeds that. But as I've talked about, I think it was a question that we had earlier on. We -- regardless of where the number is. We do believe that we expect it will accelerate throughout the year because of the tough comps you mentioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis.","Courtney Yakavonis","So do you just back on the comments about oil and gas being down another 10%. Just wanted to clarify that, that is for the full year 29th incremental 10 off of the fourth quarter. And secondly, when you're thinking about the guidance for next year, I know you've talked about kind of this slowing environment, but are there any other end markets, geographies so you are baking into your guidance to be down next year, either for the first half or for the full year?","Matthew Flannery","So first, on the oil and gas, probably flat from year-end. So that 10% would be the deceleration that's already continued. So think about that as a -- it's just the impact full year of that back half of the year declined, right? So not an additional. And then when we're thinking about other end markets. As you heard me say in the opening remarks, the industrial market is a lot of puts and takes, right? We talked a lot about upstream and then even midstream were down. Downstream was great. Downstream was a good guy. Chemical processing was down. Power was up. So there's a lot of puts and takes within it, which is why we're looking at industrial overall is flattish. And embedded in our guidance is that expectation. If something happens in industrial picks up, then that would help push us towards the higher end of the guidance. But we're really relying more on a continued strength, even if it's a little bit slower growth in our -- not in the construction verticals, right, non-res, specifically.","Courtney Yakavonis","Got you. And how would you characterize MRO activities this quarter? I think you've historically talked about close to half of the business in industrial being MRO. Have you seen any impact to that from some of those puts and takes that you mentioned?","Matthew Flannery","Nothing that we can quantify. We certainly have heard some delays from the field team about turnarounds here in Q4. So that could have impacted that sluggish Q4 result. And whether they pick those up in Q1, we're trying to stretch it to Q4 next year, who knows, those are usually time periods when they would do turnarounds. That would be the only MRO thing that was a little bit lagging. We don't think it was structural or continual? Just some push offs that we had seen, specifically in the Gulf Coast.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Great. And then just lastly, on the debt paydown. I think based on your guidance, that should begin you guys close to 2x exiting next year. Just curious how we should be thinking about your targets from there? And whether any of this when you talk about seeing construction markets up at least through 2021. Is any of this kind of planning that you could possibly see some EBITDA declines beyond 2020.","Jessica Graziano","So let me take the first part first. The debt reduction that we have targeted for 2020, that $1 billion, we feel comfortable is going to continue to get us call it, into the middle of the lower half of our range. Looking out to 2021, it's a little too early for that right now. I mean, we've talked about prioritizing, leverage reduction and working towards 2x at the peak. We're going to obviously continue that path in 2021. The quantum of it, I just don't know yet, Courtney. So I don't want to go too far on that. I mean, as far as EBITDA going forward, again, that's 2021 is just a little too far out at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup.","Timothy Thein","So first question, just on the latent capacity that you've highlighted and the focus on driving absorption how does that -- how should we expect that plays into our deliveries kind of move through the year. I'm just thinking from the standpoint of ending sequentially, I would assume you have a -- we should assume a bigger than normal seasonal decline from where you ended '19. Is that fair? I.e., if you sell more fleet when you bring in?","Matthew Flannery","So when you say deliveries, Tim, I'm assuming you mean CapEx in flow?","Timothy Thein","Yes. Yes.","Matthew Flannery","Yes. So I think you could expect us to see pretty close to a normal cadence. In Q1 will be a little big [ph], but it's a small number, right? So when you're talking about whether it's $50 million or $75 million smaller on a $15 billion base, not meaningful, but technically, a little bit softer in Q1. And then the rest of the cadence and really the meat of our CapEx spend is in that Q2 and the first -- in the beginning of Q3 range, where we really are in the peak build season of our fleet on rent. And that will flex directly correlated to how we end up doing with time utilization, fleet absorption, whatever term you want to utilize. So that's how we're thinking about it. And hopefully, that answers what you were looking for. ","Timothy Thein","Yes, yes. Okay. And then, Matt, just on the kind of the interplay between fleet age and operating costs and R&M costs. There's been a lot of discussion here in the last losing the second half about elevated R&M costs. And I get that a lot of that was moving stuff in and out of the oil and gas regions and reposition our fleet. But at almost 50 months, do you -- does that start to put some pressure on R&M? Or is that -- I mean, I know you sales are up. So presumably, that's someone a response to that. But can you just maybe speak to that just in terms of that interplay?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, on the margin, right? You could pick apart how much of its inflation, how much of it is just fleet age, but it's on the margin. The real opportunity and what you pointed to is that take advantage of a strong used market and a strong retail market to make sure we continue to manage that fleet age. Because when that market is not there, when [indiscernible] there becomes a downturn, we don't know how to predict that. But we're not predicting it certainly for 2020. We're going to need to [indiscernible] and then there may be some trade-off for R&M as you age it a year and you really turn off the inflow for a while. That's when you may see a little bit more of an impact on R&M, but the trade-off between that and having too much fleet and the positive free cash flow. Is the way we plan to think about it long term, which is why it's so important we drive new sales here. So we're not aging the fleet too quickly, while there's still growth to be had.","Timothy Thein","Okay. All right. And then maybe last one, Matt, just on the large project pipeline, what's the feedback in just in terms of the quoting levels and just size of the pipeline in terms of what you're hearing from the national account team, yes, still good. I mean, the team still feels really good, specifically about where we're aligned strongly with our national accounts and our large accounts and large projects, as you know, that's a specialty for us [indiscernible] strong. And probably more importantly, we're not hearing of any cancellations. So that's -- that would be a sign of something different. So we think overall, most of the macro indicators as well as our internal intelligence from our managers and our customers. This is that there's still growth in 2020. So big projects will continue to play a big part of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just maybe to follow-up on that last point there. Just curious how much visibility you feel like you have for the business. Matt, as you think about the second half and the growth you forecasted, I'm curious how it compares to that second half visibility that you've had at this point in the year, over the past few years?","Matthew Flannery","So I wouldn't say it's any better or worsen over the past few years. And it's not just from our customers but obviously, from the macro indicators. As we say all the time, we talked about our customer confidence index being higher than it was in August. We think it's turned a little more positive than maybe what it was full year, for our customers and really, for most industries outside of navy and industrial. So we think that's a general indication of 2020. Admittedly, we are skewed by large customers and large projects. So as I was answering Tim's question, I realize the local customers depart where maybe our visibility isn't as low as opposed to larger customers, larger projects, we're just pipeline and the supply chain of what it takes to build these launch projects give you inherently more visibility.","Steven Fisher","Okay. That's helpful. And then for Jess, what's the right way to think about SG&A over the course of 2020? Is it a dollar level? Is it a percent of sales? How much focus do you have on that number?","Jessica Graziano","Yes. The percentage -- that's a great question. The percent of sales is definitely the way I would recommend you think about it. The number might move a little here or there, but it's really -- we're managing it more so from a percent of sales perspective.","Steven Fisher","And what do you think that percent of sales, do you have a target for that? Have you kind of quantify that?","Jessica Graziano","Yes, there's no target per se. We -- as we've recognized the benefit of the synergies from the deals that we've done, right? We're pretty comfortable with the percent that we're running with right now. The biggest mover in that because it is total SG&A is what happens with stock comp. And that's really going to be dictated on whatever happens with the stock price, right? But in terms of the components of SG&A that we're managing, it's the pace that we've got right now is -- we're very comfortable with.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","In specialty, a nice trajectory in gross margin, certainly improving and talking about getting synergies there. As well. But just could, Matt, could you delve into cross-selling, how that's progressing, how you're integrating things like total control and fluid solutions. Perhaps? And can we see perhaps positive gross margins maybe in the back half of 2020 in the special?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, absolutely. And I think also the maturation of what's been a lot of cold-starts for the last few months as well as, as we continue to get the whole fluid solutions team continuing to get momentum from being 2 separate companies, right? Our pump business in Baker and how that continues. Much like I talked about the BlueLine integration, how that matures over time, is another opportunity to get margins up in the specialty business. So we absolutely feel good about that. ","And the cross-sell opportunities is, as I said earlier, something that we view as a real differentiator. It's something we spend a lot of time with all of our leaders in Minneapolis and workshops on selling that continued value because we're big believers in it. We expect that to contribute to margin expansion for specialty as well.","Jessica Graziano","So I'll just add one thing there. When you look at the specialty margins, right now, they are burdened by acquisition activity, right? So to the extent that we continue to absorb and leverage the scale and the opportunity in those acquisitions, that's going to help margins over the long-term as well.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. And then as a follow-up, and it's a follow-up to the prior question on SG&A, which you covered pretty well, but I want to delve into bad debt, which you called out in prepared remarks, that you got that $15 million lower. That was impressive, and I don't recall you calling out bad debt before. So A, kind of what was happening in the fourth quarter? And then, B, how does that play into the SG&A consideration in 2020?","Jessica Graziano","Sure. So that $15 million is actually, you can break that down, there's about 10 of that 15 is just better bad debt expense experience, right, doing better on collections, the DSO coming down, just the actual bad debt activity that we had this quarter versus last year. $5 million of the $15 million is actually a change. We had a change in the accounting standard for revenue that moved $5 million out of G&A and actually moved it up contra revenue, right? So that's actually a burden in OER.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Ramsey from Thompson Research.","Steven Ramsey","I wanted to talk on upstream, longer term, some of the stuff your control, I know, but if and when upstream picks up again, rigs are active would you move fleet back in to take advantage or doesn't the last set months change your perspective permanently on how you manage fleet in upstream areas.","Matthew Flannery","I think we were -- believe it or not, we were a little more cautious of how much we moved in this last up cycle from the 1 previously. If you remember, this used to be 10% of our business. We made -- I think we're almost 11%. We managed it down to about 5%. I think you'll see us come with that same caution again. And it's not that the business full cycle isn't profitable. It's just -- if we don't need to, it's just a little too variable. So it will depend on what's going on in the other markets if it's a place where we need to put latent demand, well then, that makes all sense in the world. But if you're talking about how you make your choices between each 1 of these cyclical challenges of upstream, and that volatility certainly informs how much bigger we're going in next time. But to be clear, also, it is still profitable business throughout the cycle. So it's not something we would eliminate altogether, but we would look to optimize existing capacity first and foremost. And even if we're pushing the limit a little bit there rather than growing new resources side.","Steven Ramsey","Great. And then just thinking about -- if I understand what you're saying, nonrental CapEx. Should we expect that to continue moving up based on cold starts, digital investments, et cetera, even though rental Capex, you're being more disciplined on that line.","Matthew Flannery","No, not really. When we're talking about investments, we're not just talking CapEx. We're talking about -- and that's why we really talk about. So maybe the word investment, it's not the -- not a balance sheet form of investment, but investing into the cost that -- with a fixed cost and the additional cost that we have to support more text for our service business or to build out the shops to do more work or trainers for safety training. Those are the service business we're talking about where we're investing more cost into. As far as the hard asset capital investments, yes, there will always be some incremental to cold-starts, you need to put new trucks in there. You need to do some of that stuff. But that's not anything extraordinary that we would call out.","Operator","This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Flannery for any further remarks. .","Matthew Flannery","Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. And just a reminder that our Q4 investor deck and 2020 guidance are available online. And as always, you can reach out to Ted with questions here in Stanford. So thanks, and we look forward to our next call. Operator, go ahead and end the call, please.","Operator","Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.","Matthew Flannery","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll start by commenting on the quarter and the state of the operating environment, and then Jess will cover the financial results. And after that, we'll take your questions. So as you saw in our release, we reported a solid third quarter, but not a perfect one. We're pleased that we delivered substantial growth while wrapping up the integrations, and that's an important achievement because it speaks to the long-term potential of leveraging our larger platform. ","Yesterday, we reported the best revenue numbers of any quarter in our history, $2.5 billion of total revenue and $2.2 billion of rental revenue. And to put that into perspective, our total revenue was up more than 5% pro forma. That took a lot of focus on the part of our field organization. Their efforts drove an improvement in our fleet productivity metric both sequentially and year-over-year. And Jess will talk more about that in a minute. ","Now here's what we could have done better. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record $1.2 billion, and that's good, but not as good as we expected. And it created some pressure on margin and flow-through. Now part of that relates to a more moderate build with the OEC on rent due to a slower growth in some of our industrial end markets. This, coupled with the acquisitions, resulted in some excess fleet, and we've been working through that. And when it makes sense, we service these assets and relocate them to markets of higher demand. This increases R&M and delivery costs in the near-term, but it drives capital-efficient growth over time. And we also sold some older assets with high operating hours, and this includes some equipment from the oil patch where upstream declined. Sales like this are generally dilutive to our used equipment margin. So the parts of the quarter that weren't perfect are largely tied to positioning, and that will continue to play out to a lesser degree in the fourth quarter. It will absorb the near-term impacts because the benefits will last well beyond that. And we're confident that we're making the right long-term decisions for the business. Our job now is to take this powerful engine that we've built and extract increasing value from it over time. ","As we discussed in July, in the first half of the year, we were focused internally on the structural phase of the BlueLine integration as well as some smaller deals. Now we've pivoted to an external focus. Our sales territories are finalized. We've added more sales talent in the field to expand our coverage. And we've enhanced our outreach program to reactivate dormant customers. ","We've also been making significant investments in our fleet mix, including continued investment in our specialty solutions. Having the right fleet in the right markets delivers on two fronts: It helps us solve more challenges for our customers, and it's also key to our strategy for improving return on capital.","And moving on to the operating environment, the construction landscape has remained strong across the board, and our customer survey suggests this trend should remain intact. All three construction sectors are showing good growth: nonresidential, infrastructure and residential. In fact, the rental revenue for nonres, our core market, was up almost 9% pro forma in the quarter. And our focus on infrastructure continues to pay dividends as it now accounts for double-digit percentage of our total rental revenue. This positive environment was partially offset by headwinds in some of the industrial verticals, as I mentioned earlier. The further deceleration in upstream oil and gas is reflected by the rig count data. By contrast, downstream grew in high single digits, and there were some other puts and takes in the industrial verticals. So in general, industrial was more of a mixed bag than it was in the first half of the year. ","So for the first time in a while, construction and industrial activity appeared to be on somewhat different paths, and we've taken this into account in making the updates to our 2019 guidance. Our new ranges assume a more modest rate of growth in the near-term impacts on flow-through that I mentioned earlier, as well as our expectation for higher free cash flow. And Jess will address these in more detail.","Now looking at it geographically. The majority of our regions were up in the quarter. Only a few were down and those were small single-digit declines. And our Specialty segment continues to deliver strong growth. Trench, power and fluids solutions combined generated a 21% increase in rental revenue as reported compared to a year ago. And organic revenue accounted for about half of that gain. And a shout out to our European team, fluid solutions. They delivered 17% pro forma growth in the quarter in local currency. In North America, we opened another 8 specialty cold-starts in the last 3 months, bringing that network total to 361 locations against our target of 363 by year-end.","Before I wrap it up, I want to give you a safety update, and it's a really good one. Heading into September, we challenged the team with an aggressive target for a recordable rate well below 1. And our team responded with an incredible performance. They did better than target, resulting in 12 of our regions and 99% of our branches reporting zero injuries. September was the safest month for United Rentals in our 22-year history. And I'm personally inspired by the way our 19,000 employees have come together as one and embraced our safety culture.","Now, the one final comment before I turn the call over to Jess. I want to reiterate our confidence in our position in going into 2020. We appreciate that economic and political uncertainty is a concern for a lot of people. And while we don't have a crystal ball, we do have a lot of experience in planning for different end market scenarios. We can shift gears quickly when we need to. Most important, we remain strongly committed to our strategy of driving profitable growth and to the capital discipline, cost management and execution required to do that. These are the attributes to drive returns in every area of our business under all types of operating conditions. ","So with that, I'll ask Jess to walk you through the quarter and then we'll go to Q&A. Jess, over to you.","Jessica Graziano","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As with past quarters, I'll walk you through our as reported results, but I'll pivot at times to speak to our performance on a pro forma basis. That includes BlueLine and also includes a month of Baker as we lapse the acquisition on July 31. Let's get into the Q3 results.","Rental revenue on an as-reported basis grew 15% or $286 million to $2.147 billion. That's a record for us. The increase is primarily related to the impact of both BlueLine and Baker. But on a pro forma basis, rental revenue was up a solid 4.2% for the quarter. ","Within rental revenue, as reported OER growth contributed approximately $242 million of the increase, ancillary added $44 million and re-rent was flat. Here's the breakdown of that $242 million or 15% OER growth. We had growth in our fleet of 18%. That's about $287 million of additional revenue. Fleet inflation cost us the usual 1.5% or $24 million. And fleet productivity on an as-reported basis was down 1.3% or $21 million. A more helpful way to consider fleet productivity is on a pro forma basis, which was up 1.7%. And within that number, rental rates and mix were positive for the quarter, partially offset by lower time utilization. ","That's rental revenue. Let's move on used sales. Used sales revenue was up 41% or $58 million year-over-year. The used sales environment continues to be healthy, and we sold $132 million more fleet at OEC than last year. This included a significant increase in sales through our retail channel, which made up 60% of our overall sales. The pricing on those retail sales was down slightly around 1.5%. ","Adjusted gross margin on used sales was 46%, down from 50%. That decline is due mainly to the mix of equipments sold and channel mix, which included some auction sales of some tired fleet from the oil patch. Taking a look at EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.207 billion, another record for us, and an increase of $148 million or 14% versus prior year. Here's a bridge on the as reported changes. ","The improvement in OER added approximately $140 million. Ancillary and re-rent together contributed $4 million. Used sales added $21 million to adjusted EBITDA. SG&A expenses were a headwind of $24 million, mostly due to adding the BlueLine and Baker cost basis. And that leaves $7 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit in the quarter, which is primarily coming from better performance in our other lines of business. ","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5%, which is down 150 basis points year-over-year due mainly to the impact of bringing in BlueLine and Baker. On a pro forma basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points. That is in part coming from a shift in revenue mix with higher used sales in the quarter. It's also due to higher operating costs, primarily in repair, maintenance and delivery. These costs were associated with getting excess fleet rent ready and into higher growth end markets. As reported adjusted EBITDA flow-through was approximately 40%. Now if I reconcile flow-through similar to what we've shared in the past, which is to adjust for the impact of our acquisitions, including synergies as well as the impact of new and used sales, adjusted EBITDA flow-through is still about 40%. The biggest drag on that adjusted flow-through this quarter comes from the higher operating cost I mentioned. However, that calculation is very sensitive. So I'll add that the GAAP this quarter from 40% to a flow-through of close to 60% is around $12 million, which on its own is the cost associated with the investment we've made in repairing and repositioning the fleet this quarter.","As for adjusted EPS, a robust $5.96 in the quarter compared with $4.74 in Q3 of '18. That's an increase of 26% primarily from better operating performance across the business and includes the impact of our acquisitions. Adjusted EPS was also helped this quarter from lower shares outstanding. ","Let's move to CapEx and free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've brought in $1.97 billion in gross CapEx with $845 million of that having come in during Q3. We're on pace to purchase between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion of CapEx for the year. And we've adjusted our view of net rental CapEx down for the year by $50 million as we anticipate selling more used equipment than originally expected. That will refresh more of our fleet in a strong used market and position us well going into 2020.","Free cash flow, very strong as we generated $1.1 billion through the end of September. We are on track to deliver our full year expectations, which we increased in our guidance update. Our tax-adjusted ROIC remains strong coming in at 10.6% for the third quarter, and that continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital. Year-over-year, tax adjusted ROIC was down 40 basis points primarily as a result of the expected drag from our acquisitions, and we believe that impact will moderate over time.","Taking a look at the balance sheet. Net debt at September 30 was $11.7 billion, which is up $1.6 billion from last year. The biggest driver there was the financing of the BlueLine deal, offset in part by our reducing debt through the year. Our total liquidity at September 30 was a very strong $2.16 billion that's comprised mainly of ABL capacity.","Leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. That's down 10 basis points versus where we were at the end of the second quarter. And as we've updated our forecast for the remainder of the year, we expect to finish 2019 at 2.6x, which is a 50 basis point decline from the end of last year. ","Here's a quick update on our share repurchase program. We purchased $210 million of stock in the third quarter on our current $1.25 billion program, which puts us at $1.05 billion purchased to date. We still expect to complete this program by year-end, and I'll also note that our total share count at the end of the third quarter was down about 7% year-over-year. ","I'll wrap up with a few comments on guidance. Our update was impacted primarily by our third quarter results and trends. Some of which we expect will continue through the end of the year. First, we still expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth in total revenue, but the revenue mix has shifted between slightly lower rental revenue and slightly higher used sales. That shift in revenue mix is reflected in our total revenue range and its impact on adjusted EBITDA. ","Second, cost management remains a focus for us. We are balancing that with the need to repair and reposition excess fleet, putting that fleet into strong end markets, which we believe is the right choice for the business. As a result, some of those higher repair, maintenance and delivery costs will play out through the fourth quarter. That change is reflected in our updated adjusted EBITDA range as well. ","Third, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate better free cash flow than originally expected. So we brought up the bottom of the free cash flow range such that we expect to generate between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion in free cash flow this year. That compares to a little over $1.3 billion last year. ","And with that, let's move on to your questions. So operator, would you open the line, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Given the way the rest of the year guidance played out where mix obviously was fairly significant as well as some of the cost obviously to repair and maintain and move some of the equipment out of the softer industrial markets, can you help us a bit -- we're trying to think about 2020 margin sensitivity to mix. Can you give us a little education on exactly how we should think about if the industrial markets start the year a little bit weaker, but construction a bit better? How to think about some of the geographic issues of equipment -- let's say equipments coming out of Texas and going to the Southeast? Can you just give us a little ladle in to how to think about the sensitivity to mix going into next year?","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Dave. This is Matt. So first off, I think one of our opportunities, especially if we know it ahead of time, right? So if we feel comfortable that the work we're going to do throughout this quarter and our planning process for 2020, and the field validation and customer information that we're going gives us a better view. The sooner we can reposition stuff appropriate to where the opportunities are, the better the outcome's going to be. There will be some nuance not just between oil and gas and other markets, some nuance as to markets that bring higher returns than other or a different mix than other. But I think in the balance of a full year planning area, the most important part is getting the fleet in the right area so we can maximize the usage of that fleet and therefore, our fleet efficiency. So that's how we view it. Acknowledging there can be some moves. All that work will be done in detail from the ground up, and then reviewed top-down to get us ready for 2020 guidance in January.","David Raso","Would you say the fleet movement that occurred in the third quarter is the bulk of the moves you expect to make through the end of the year? I mean I'm just trying to get a read on how you view some of the industrial markets in '20 by the actions you're taking in '19. Is there still more to do? Or do you feel you've made all the moves already.","Matthew Flannery","I think by really probably midway through this quarter, but certainly by the end of fourth quarter, that answer will be a yes. To be fair to the question, oil and gas accelerated -- the downside of oil and gas accelerated faster than we thought in Q3. It's only 4% of our business now. Rig counts are down at the end of the -- as we sit here today, 17%. And our revenue's down 20%. So does that get worse? I don't know how far you can fall from this low level, but that will be the only wild card. And to be fair, that is what created our challenge here in the back half on movement and extra investment we need to make to pull that fleet out because it is a unique market. Other than that, our movements are usually just part of our regular business because we have those very fungible assets in such a broad, broad network. So long -- short answer, yes, understanding that oil and gas part to be the only variable. And I don't pretend to know where oil and gas is going, but I got to imagine it's pretty close to the bottom.","David Raso","And lastly, the fleet productivity, be it pro forma or year-over-year, however you want to think about it, report it. Can you help us a bit with just some sense of movement from the third quarter to fourth quarter? What we should generally expect? Does the fleet productivity improve on a year-over-year basis pro forma reported? Just if you can help us with some framing it?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. As we've discussed before, as much as I'd love to be able to predict this, just like we would love to predict rate and time that precisely. Those are the 2 biggest variables along with mix in these numbers. We're not trying to predict that. It's an output that we are utilizing to discuss what happened. And really not getting into -- even for the fourth quarter, forget about 2020. The predictability of it or our ability to forecast it, we still peg 1.5 point overall throughout the year is what we want to do and what we want to achieve because we want to achieve our inflation. That will change in some years and maybe our inflation will change in some years depending on what the macro is. But we're really using it as postmortem on how to explain how our revenue acted than a predictive metric, to be fair. So it's a long no, but I'm just trying to give you color on why.","David Raso","Yes. Not to push you to an exact number, but just the idea of the fleet will be bigger year-over-year in the fourth quarter than the implied revenue growth. And especially given used equipment sales will be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, I'm just trying to make sure we don't get off the phone thinking that fleet productivity year-over-year degrades, deteriorates, from what we just saw, at least not materially, because it's sort of what's implied in the guide if we use the revenue midpoint. So I just wanted to give you the opportunity to address that.","Matthew Flannery","Yes. No, I understand the viewpoint and the position there. As always, we'll do the obligatory don't anchor of the midpoint. But to be fair, we give you -- we create the midpoint for you. It really is a number that's going to move compared to where we end up within that pretty tight range that we gave you. So -- and part of that range, you will be very pleased with it. And if we end up in a different part of that range, maybe less pleased. But I would just say it is a way that we talk about the output and not to be predicted. So I get your point though. So thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius.","Robert Wertheimer","So I just wanted to ask about outside of oil and gas, it seems -- I mean, you guys have a really good insight to what's happening, sort of a finger on the pulse of the construction and other economy. And it seems like it's pretty good still. So I wonder if you could talk just a bit about how much visibility you have into next year. Not your forecast, but just like how far your customers -- you can see -- you can see some starts, you can see some cancellations, et cetera. And then just as a management team, how are you thinking about -- philosophically, the market's obviously very worried about recession and different things, or as you're seeing strong trends. How do you sort of think about balancing those to go into guidance?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. Thanks, Rob. So as we're into the planning process, and we'll be doing reviews here and within the next 30 days, in detail at the field level, we'll -- a couple of data sets that we look at. In addition to everything that all of you have access to, our additional information, as we've said before, is our customer confidence index, which remains strong. I referred to that in my prepared remarks. Whereas we have still 60% of our customers survey believe next -- 2020 will be better than 2019. So admittedly, that subset is more large customers. So as we've said before, strategically why we focus on large customers is they're the ones that are going to do better in a slower growth environment. So yes, you could say if you want to jade that at all. But 97% of the customers say it will be flat to better. Only 3% of the customers are looking at their business as 2020 being down, so that's a good indicator for us. ","We then need to test that with our field representatives, whether it be sales folks or the managers, in what they're seeing in their business in the competitive landscape, in a volume landscape, in a jobs landscape. So all that work will be done throughout Q4, and we'll inform what we guide to for 2020. And the industrial part, I mean, the other part of it I'd say is I think some of the headwinds we have absorbed internally in the first half of the year won't be there next year. So I think we'll be better prepared to position the fleet more accurately. We'll be more externally focused. So I'm looking forward to that after the team did a lot of work internally in the first half of this year and is moving past that.","Robert Wertheimer","That's helpful. You've outgrown the market for a number of years via acquisition and just your own investments. And then obviously, you're skewed towards the bigger customers that ought to outgrow the construction market. So in a flatter market, you would continue to expect to continue that trend?","Matthew Flannery","It's always our goal to outperform the end market, right? I mean, that is always our goal. We've got a lot of resources. We got a lot of breadth and depth. And we serve a lot of end markets. So for this quarter, for example, if we are overly reliant on oil and gas or a flattish industrial sector, this would have been a different outcome for us, right? We wouldn't have record revenue, record EBITDA. The fungibility of the assets and the diversification of the portfolio gives us a lot of confidence that we have the opportunity to outperform the end market, and that is our goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","You guys are acknowledging that the demand in the industrial side is a little slower. I mean, you sold of some excess fleet. I'm just curious to hear. Why didn't you cut the gross CapEx guide again? And is it fair to say that you're more likely to trend towards the lower end of the gross CapEx guide as you finish out the year?","Matthew Flannery","No. Ross, I wouldn't say. I'll only answer the first part of your question, which is why. We had the opportunity to take some older assets that were at the end of their rental useful life, and sell them into a strong end market. And when we think about some of the stats that Jess reported in her prepared remarks, think about that used sales market still throwing up higher margin. We're still recovering $0.53 on the original OEC dollar per fleet that's over 86 months old. So over 7 years old. And we had the ability -- after cutting CapEx in July, we had the decision to make, do we cut further if we've got, let's say, a 100 million extra capacity. Or we take an opportunity to refresh the fleet. The other issue is we generate higher free cash flow. So there was no reason for us to cut the gross versus the net, and we think that positions our fleet better. As we've always said, we want to keep that fleet age at the appropriate time so when there is a downturn, we can age it, and that's part of our resiliency. So we view that as part of that strategy -- continuing that part of the strategy.","Ross Gilardi","And you went through this, a similar dynamic in the industrial recession a few years ago where you redeployed fleet out of the oil patch into some of these other markets, and you managed to pull it off. Can you give us a little more color as to where in terms of geography or end markets you are going to move that fleet? And what gives you confidence that you won't create an oversupply situation elsewhere in doing so?","Matthew Flannery","In the relative scale of our $15 billion of fleet, we're not going to move it. It's still a pretty small number, right? We're not going to move it to any end market that it's enough to overwhelm, right? I guess, we move all of it to one market. Technically, that could be. We're not doing that. We're moving it to the markets where nonres is strong. And to be fair, even close by, downstream's still strong. So just for clarity. We talked about industrial being choppy. They're not all down. Downstream is still a good part of our business. Upstream and midstream are negative. And the rest of them are just kind of a little bit up, a little bit down, leading to a flattish industrial overall end market. But that -- those in markets that we have and the customers that we can serve outside of those verticals is where we're moving that fleet. ","And it's not a single enough, large enough number to any one of those verticals or geographies that's just going to create a supply glut in our opinion. I'd say the other difference between -- because I know a lot of people will tie this dialogue of oil and gas to back what happened between '14 and '15, right? When oil and gas was at a peak then, it was a much bigger part of our business. But even for the industry overall, that knock on impact of what happened with oil and gas in '15, of the infrastructure to build -- to help serve the area around it of improved -- or additional hotels, retail, right? Shopping centers, even schools, all that's built out already. That was not part of this oil and gas run the past couple of years. So therefore, you won't have the knock-on effect that you had back then. And that's the way we're viewing this. We're viewing this as a temporary issue that we had to work through, but nowhere near the impact that we had back in '15.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. And just lastly, how much momentum do you feel like you have in the tank for specialty in the next year? I mean, it's got 20% of your business. Still growing 10% organically. Does it feel sustainable even if nonres does have sort of a notch lower. And what are the areas you're most excited about in the specialty portfolio?","Matthew Flannery","We absolutely feel good it, and that team continues to generate not only good returns, but good growth. And I think fluid solution, right. Sometimes, it gets lost in the conversation of the bigger integration. Fluid solutions is a new go-to-market strategy where we had to integrate the Baker and the old pump team. And so they've worked through that in the past 12 months. I think they've got great opportunity to get externally focused and run with the ball a little faster. So we like the prospects.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tin Thein from Citigroup.","Timothy Thein","Matt, you touched earlier on mix. And I wanted to see if you could give any sort of help in terms of, again, high-level of thoughts on rate for 2020. And specifically, if the remaining couple of months here played out with whatever normal sea patterns would suggest. What would that imply in terms of the rate carryover for '20?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, Tim, I wish I could help you. We're committed to not giving that level of detail. The way that we're going to talk about rate, time and mix in the future is exactly how we're talking about it this quarter. We're going to give it in arrears. We're going to give it all in year-over-year. And we're going to talk about in fleet productivity, and we'll give you that numerical value. And then what we're going to do qualitatively is say, \"As we did this quarter, rate's a good guy. Mix has been a good guy overcoming some headwinds that we've had in time utilization.\" As we look forward, I mean, the mix of those 3 will be impacted by the demand environment certainly, right, all 3 of them, and our decisions on where we invest our capital and what our customers rent. So that's how we look at it. So I want to stay true to that. We want to stay true to that, because we think isolating any one of them belies the interaction between the 3 of them in our business going forward. And that's really why we made the change. Our business has changed. If this was back 2006, it was very simple. We knew our fleet mix have changed much, and it was a direct correlation. The interplay of the 3 is much more relevant for today, which is why we made the pivot.","Timothy Thein","Okay. And I guess old habits die hard, I guess. But maybe just a second one was coming back to I think you said your nonres -- or just maybe it was construction in total, up almost 9% in a backdrop where depending on what statistics you're using, I mean, there's not much by way of overall construction spending growth. So just curious in terms of -- I mean, this whole notion of outgrowth and kind of the magnitude, is that -- basically what's contributing to that? Is it pretty big number, and I don't know if that's -- is there any tangible share -- or not share, but kind of penetration gains you think are contributing to that? Or maybe just touch on that in terms of if we are in an environment where nonres spending is flat to maybe up a little bit next year, just what sort of outgrowth could we potentially be looking at?","Matthew Flannery","Sure. So first of all, I think it's a little bit of share gain, right? And when we think about the bigs getting bigger, which is something we've talked about, I mean, it's why the consolidation plays work. We think the opportunity of that density and diversity gives you the opportunity to over-index in places that are growing, and therefore, dampen the impact or mitigate the impact to places that aren't. So that's the overarching reason why we think we can swim upstream so to speak in different end markets, and we continue to feel that way. I would say that every time we look in arrears or what some of the end market data says, it's maybe too self-serving to say we outperform it. So maybe sometimes, they're just wrong. But at the end of the day, the macro data is a good framing for us to look at. But that deep dive on what our customers are telling us and their backlogs are, and what our managers and sales teams are telling us of the work that they foresee needing to serve is our single largest barometer to how we're able to build the plan. I'm not saying we're going to over perform by 30% of what the end market forecast say because they're just not reliable enough to build business plan around that. So we're going to do all that hard work, as I said, throughout Q4, throughout our planning process, and I'll inform where we guide for 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about the demand cadence over the course of the quarter. Your fleet in the quarter grew about 3%, which is 1 point better than normal seasonality. So it looks like you're able to put more equipment to work this third quarter sequentially compared to normal seasonality. Can you comment on that? Is that what's playing out in the field? And it looks like by the improvement in fleet productivity, I would imagine utilization improved at least in line with normal seasonality in the quarter. Can you just comment on that, because in the prepared remarks, you spoke about oil and gas headwinds, et cetera. But you folks were able to pool a lot of the equipment work this quarter, and I'm just trying to square up those 2 points.","Matthew Flannery","I really just think it was that level of demand in our core end markets and with our key customers. And frankly, we would have liked than done a lot better. And had we not done some of that choppiness, that's why we pointed to it, we -- when you look at the year and break it in 2 halves, we talked in July about the internal focus maybe not getting that build that we wanted in the first half. When you look at the back half of the year, we're pretty dead on as to what our original thoughts for how much OEC on rent fleet you build in the back half. Our hope was that we backfill some of that hole. And as we got into some of the end markets not giving us that, specifically oil and gas, midstream; and maybe flattish, let's say, manufacturing down a little bit, we just didn't get that opportunity in some of those to offset what the team did do by backfilling the hole in a lot of the nonres markets. And that's the way to look at it. So I'd say the demand trend was, back-half, probably as expected originally. Would have -- the progress, I wish we'd done better. I wish we could have backfilled that hole a little bit more. And therefore, we would've drove a little bit more volume. We're talking on 1% area so we're talking on the margins here. When you look about year-over-year, what we reported in January versus what we did here. But I think demand allowed us to have that growth throughout Q3.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And Matt, earlier in the discussion, you spoke about how pricing played out in the oil and gas downturn and the fact it's a smaller equipment sized market today. Can you just expand on other differences you see in the market. So talk about the impact of data availability we're hearing from construction equipment dealers with rental fleets, that the supply demand data has been really helpful? Are you seeing that in your market in terms of better ability to match the supply with demand for the industry. Because the concern is, in the last cycle, utilization moved down, and then pricing moved down. And I just want to make sure we ask the question of what's playing out. They're pooling in mid cycles. So I'm wondering if you can expand on any other drivers there.","Matthew Flannery","Sure. First and foremost, I think the discipline at the industry -- and we've been talking about this for a few. I think the discipline in the industry is showing, in the last 10 years of my career compared to the first 18 years of my career, is night and day, right? So that's #1. And I think data has been a big help on that and I think history has been a teacher on that too, right, going through '09, and that's scar tissue. I think you can't underestimate the impact that may have had on folks being much more responsible for that. There will be times throughout any cycle where it will get ahead and pull back. And I think the industry overall is responding appropriately. But to be clear, I also don't think the end of demand is here.","So we have the opportunity to continue to complete the work. I think our actions of consolidating capacity to drive growth as opposed to just adding capacity to drive growth is a significant difference, right, when you think about last 10 years. I think some of our competitors are doing the same. I think that's good news. So I think when you think about all those issues, the availability, right, that those of us, which is about half the industry now, get from the Rouse information, is helpful. Technology in general, the professionalization of the industry, which consolidates and help bring having analytics, having data as a resource to think through investments and timing. All those are part of why I think we'll see a better -- why we've been seeing a better outcome in supply demand.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, on the cold-starts within specialty. Can you just talk about what the learning curve has been as you've ramped up the cold-starts over the course of this year? And as you look at the opportunity in terms of the potential new locations over the next couple of years, what that opportunity set for expanded cold-starts looks like on a multi-year basis based on everything we've learned with the rollout this year?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. Not terribly different than what we've been doing, right? So we don't really communicate it that way. The year 1, the year 2, the year 3 communication. That's not our -- that's not the way we do it. And mostly because many of our cold-starts are growing on the border of another one. So there's a lot of efficiency that's built-in when 1 store doesn't -- especially in our specialty network. As we build it out, that network doesn't have to travel out as far as to serve the market. We could be more responsive. We get growth out of that. But then we also get better value in the existing store that's no longer going there. So there's a couple of different calls to look at it. I think we're going to have a specialty day that maybe we could talk about that, and Paul will leaving that in more detail, that, that would be more helpful as opposed to trying to get to that level of specificity on this call. But you know what, we'll follow-up with Ted, make sure that we get that on your calendar. I think that would be a great opportunity to learn about how specialty cold-starts, especially growth, play out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just a follow-up on Ross' question. Just really, if you could characterize how tight are the markets from a supply\/demand basis in those construction areas where you see the better opportunities to move fleet. To what extent are you seeing others sending equipment into those same places at the moment?","Matthew Flannery","I wouldn't say less or more competitive than they've been, right? So I'd say -- we're not seeing an extra competitiveness, and we're not seeing any easy roads either, right? We have to earn our customer's business every day. I would say that there's only a few companies, and this is why I think the bigs are getting bigger. There's only a few companies that have that flexibility and fungibility to do that. So it's not the whole market. It's only a subset of the market that can make those pivots in a quarter-to-quarter or within an annual cycle because other companies that don't have stores, they aren't -- they're just not going to have the ability to go ramp-up and open up an x location because all of a sudden, there seems to be better opportunity there than where they reside. They may do it on the fringes, right? They may travel a little further. But that's a little bit different than the broader footprints that a couple of companies in the industry have. So I think that's a big differentiation and why you're not seeing a rush to any individual market, quite frankly. I hope that answers your question.","Steven Fisher","Yes. That's helpful. And then any change you can give us some color on how the fleet productivity metric trended over the course of the quarter. Did your upside to the 1.5% target, did that outcome more later in the quarter or kind of stay throughout?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, no. We're not pulling -- actually, we don't even calculate it that way. But we're not pulling that apart that way. This is a quarter and year-over-year result that we look out and prep for earnings to help communicate what happened in the quarter, but not sequentially or not trying to use it as a trend line or anything like that. So no, I don't have that color for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.","Joseph O'Dea","Can you quantify how much fleet you've taken out of the oil patch? And then Jess, I think you touched on this but just to confirm, what the related repositioning and repair costs are that are attached to that.","Jessica Graziano","So I'll start there, Joe. So we called out about $12 million of cost that we incurred this quarter. Going forward into Q4, we think it will be something less than that as we do have a little bit to work through, but something less. I don't have a number right now, but--","Matthew Flannery","Yes. And when you think about the fleet, it's a portion of, and it will be in Q4, say, 1% or 4% of your business, right? So somewhere in the $100 million range, let's say we moved about half of it out of there, we got another half to go, depending on how it turns. That could accelerate or decelerate if we get in different news there, but it's in that realm of impact from an OEC perspective.","Steven Fisher","And then just the related kind of EBITDA bridge sequentially, you're implying margin's up. Seasonally, they're typically down 3Q to 4Q. You're still going to have some of these carryover costs. Just any other factors to consider as we move from 3Q to 4Q EBITDA margins and see that improvement.","Jessica Graziano","So there will be the impact -- in addition to the acquisition impact, there will be the impact of the flow-through margin of -- as I mentioned, we'll have a little bit higher used sales, and so that's going to come in at a lower margin than the rental would. The other caution, and I know Matt mentioned it earlier, but I will caution against using the midpoint.","Joseph O'Dea","Yes. I think whether you use the low end, high end or midpoint, it's implying a 48.8% EBITDA margin in 4Q versus 48.5% in Q3. And so I was just curious about what some of the good guys are in terms of the sequential move.","Jessica Graziano","Yes. The two drivers are the ones that we mentioned. The BlueLine impact, which we'll anniversary that on November 1. And then the -- that shift, that mixed shift between used and rental.","Joseph O'Dea","Okay. And then Matt, just on replacement CapEx. As you do a little bit more this year, does that mean that you're positioned to do a little bit less next year? And then just bigger picture, as you think about the backdrop of the market, are you seeing anything that's leading you to think we're gonna pause a little bit on some of this replacement spend?","Matthew Flannery","No. I wouldn't -- definitely, we're not planning on doing any less, right? The used sales end market, as we've talked about, are still strong. We still want to keep that fleet age as fresh as we can as we're still in a growth cycle. So I wouldn't -- I would say if anything, we plan to be maybe 5%, even 10% more.","Jessica Graziano","For the replacement.","Matthew Flannery","For replacement in 2020. So that's the way we're thinking about it. If the market changes, if the outputs, right, change, which we're not seeing even as recently as the last month. The used sales channels are still good, and we're going to utilize them to keep the fleet freshened a little bit. And what we did here in Q3, it's a good way to re-profile, too, right? So as you try and continue to get your mix right, you could sell off some of the older assets and use those funds as a net -- in net CapEx to help re-profile your fleet versus only using growth, which is a much smaller number to re-profile.","Jessica Graziano","So Joe, to be a little bit helpful. One step further, we're still pulling the plan together so obviously, we're still landing on what we think the growth capital could be for next year. But as far as the replacement, as Matt mentioned, that will be up next year. And if you think about something in the neighborhood of selling kind of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion at OEC inflation-adjusted, that's going to look like something, call it, $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.","Courtney Yakavonis","Just wanted to go back just on the comment about the $12 million of cost incurred. Was that $12 million incremental? Or kind of what was that versus your baseline expectation for fleet repair and maintenance? And then I think you had called out in the press release increases of 27% and 19% for repair and maintenance versus delivery. So just wanted to understand if that was included in that number. And then if you could also just help us understand for the gen rent gross margin impact, how much was in gen rent versus specialty?","Jessica Graziano","Sure. So Courtney, it's Jess. So from the -- for that $12 million, that was incremental for the quarter in terms of isolating what we leaned into to repair and reposition the fleet. Some of that excess fleet that Matt talked about and getting that into strong end markets. As far as what you're seeing as the increase is R&M versus delivery, the mix impact of that is we saw a little bit more of the repair and maintenance and delivery cost in the -- together in the gen rent segment. There was a bit more on the repair and maintenance side on the Specialty segment, a little less delivery. So that's the dynamic there.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Got you. And then can you help us understand when you do the repair and maintenance for something like this, does it extend the fleet age? Do you consider it getting reset at all? But how do we think about how much this kind of extends the fleet age?","Jessica Graziano","Yes. There's no real extension of the fleet age per se. It's just making sure that it's in rent-ready mode to get into those markets. We did spend a little bit more on some of the repair of the fleet that came out of the oil patch because that's going to be kind of worn down a little bit more than across some of the other end markets. So there's a lean into the repair and maintenance as a result of that.","Matthew Flannery","Yes. And we don't account for it in any way if capitalizing or extending or anything like that either. So that's the difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital.","Seth Weber","Most of the questions have been asked. But just on the $50 million-or-so of fleet that was moved and the $100 million that may be in aggregate, is most of that -- is it fair to assume that most of that is gen rent versus specialty? And can you just talk about what you're seeing in the specialty side in some of these oil and gas markets?","Matthew Flannery","Sure. Certainly most, but there's some pump in gen sets that we have some work there, as you know, in the specialty. But I would say it's primarily gen rent, say 70 -- you want to just -- we don't have it. I don't have it broken down for you here. But we can maybe give you that data. But primarily gen rent. Think about our fleet overall, and it follows fleet profile.","Seth Weber","Yes, no. I mean, just some of this specialty is just harder to move, obviously, so I was just trying to get an understanding. I think in -- during the last downturn, you gave us a number that's something like 80% of the revenue from -- in Texas was from nonenergy stuff. Is that still kind of a good framework to use? So I know the energy business -- the upstream business is smaller today than it was back in 5 years ago. So is it -- maybe is it less than 20% of your business in Texas at this point?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. I actually don't have that answer for you. I think we've talked about it in whole. I actually don't recall. I've been here a while. I just can't remember. I was talking about it as far as what percentage of the Texas business as a whole. Somebody must have slipped that by me, because I would certainly stop that conversation just from a competitive perspective. But I actually don't recall that number.","Seth Weber","Okay. Fair enough. And then just given the potential for caution around the macro. Clearly, it's not manifesting yet, but just on the broader macro on the construction business, et cetera. Are you thinking about changing your cadence of discussions with the OEMs? This is kind of around the time of year you would start to plan for 2020. Your discussions with the OEMs. I mean, are you thinking about maybe going a little bit more slowly this year versus prior years?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, no. I think we'll keep the spend pretty successful for us. I think we'll keep that similar cadence. I think it helps them, right? And it helps us. So we make sure we understand what pipe -- once we build the plan, we understand what pipeline we think we need, with flexibility, right, which we always have, as you know. And we try to be reasonable. We don't overuse that flexibility for no value. And it gives them the opportunity to build in their plant. And we need good suppliers. So we need them to get their supply chain in order. So it's a partnership. And I think the way we've been doing it, we're comfortable with the outputs, and we're going to stay on cadence.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","A quick question back on the outgrowth piece. How much of that is -- well, when you look across the portfolio in international account profile, are you over-indexed, under-indexed to any verticals necessarily? Or is it pretty much consistent with the rest of the portfolio?","Matthew Flannery","From an asset cap perspective?","Stanley Elliott","Yes.","Matthew Flannery","I wouldn't say over-indexed. Is there a percentage points of movement in certain verticals that's more primarily -- and I would segregate it as key accounts not just National Accounts. As we've talked to you all before, our National Accounts use our national footprint. But we have strategic accounts and key accounts that are equally as important, just use maybe regional marketplaces, right? So I would say the combination of those is -- no, I wouldn't call them heavily more influenced by any specific vertical. I think that's a pretty broad portfolio as well.","Stanley Elliott","Yes. No, I appreciate that. I was just curious about the 9% construction growth, which is much better than what we're seeing. And then Jess, thanks for the slide on the free cash flow conversion. Anything or any reason out of the ordinary why those numbers shouldn't carry forward as we look into 2020 and beyond?","Jessica Graziano","So we're still planning 2020, which includes what we believe our view of free cash flow is going to be, not just from an operating perspective, but also taxes and interest and some of the other lines. So that's still to come, Stanley. What I will tell you is we are planning for another robust year of free cash flow. Exactly how much, I don't know yet. But it will be robust.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from our Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Matt, you covered in the beginning in the prepared remarks, a bid on the integration in BlueLine. But that was a bit of a hiccup last quarter. So just looking for a second, what were some of the actions that were taken this summer to enhance that integration process? And maybe some lessons learned since obviously URI is well experienced an acquisition integration. But what were some things that you took out at that process and would apply going forward?","Matthew Flannery","Great question, Scott. So we do have a robust playbook, and it's -- every deal makes it better. And that's one of, what I think the values of learning, that gives us. And I want to focus specifically on BlueLine, because the real thing that we learned is BlueLine was the third deal in many markets in 18 months. It was the first deal, and we've been talking about a different deal that had the challenges, and it would probably still be third deal. So that's the part of it. And if I had to do it all over again, I'd spend much more time making sure the external portion of it, that customer outreach, was -- which we haven't had to spend extra energy on in the past. So that's something in this deal. Whether it was just because it was the third, which I think plays a lot, or whether it was the largest of the 3. I don't even care which 1 of those of the two it is because I don't really know, but that's what I would change. ","We would learn -- we would have a much stronger external focus on the front-end of it versus what is a very aggressive internal focus as we get everybody on the same system in 9 days and try to get all the brands consolidations done. So we're working as 1 unit and people know what they're doing in the first 3 months. So we got to bounce that aggressiveness internally with equal aggressiveness externally. That would be my learning and I think what we'd integrate into the playbook. The good news is I don't think we're going to -- I don't think there's 3 big deals to get done in a row again in the near-term. So I don't think that, that's parts going to be an issue. But the external focus is a good learning.","Scott Schneeberger","Appreciate that. And here at the end of the call, I guess a question I can't help but ask. You are generating a lot of cash a lot of flexibility there. And there's been a lot of talk this year more than in years past of M&A in the specialty rental space. So as we head into next year and everything you've been working on to integrate will now be in the rearview mirror having anniversary-ed, just could you address the use of capital again. I know, Jess, you have the new lower leverage objective. But just please put that in perspective for us here at this part of the year.","Matthew Flannery","I think you hit on it. As we've been saying, that our lean, at a time where we're a little more focused on absorbing and leveraging, we still look at deals. We are still on a pipeline that we do work on. But the lean would be more on additional products and services customers versus our overlapping products and services. And the second would be filling out any gaps in distribution and footprint. So by definition, that leans towards specialty. And on top of that, they're good return business. The 3 criteria of cultural, strategic and then financial still needs to be met, and that's a high bar for us. So -- but there's deals out there, and we'll see. If any of them meet those 3 deals, we have a flexibility. Jess and the team have given us the balance sheet and the flexibility that we could still do stuff that's accretive to the business. But we certainly also have the opportunity to absorb and leverage what we bought. So it's that balance right now, with a lean towards specialty.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.","Matthew Flannery","Great. And thank you, operator. And everyone, thanks for joining us.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Well, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. I have some comments to share with you on the quarter. But first, I want to speak about the upcoming leadership transition. As you know, this is my last earnings call with you. And when we report our second quarter results, Matt will be standing here as CEO. And I'll be behind the scenes as Chairman.","It's an honor for me to take the range from Jenne Britell, who has been instrumental in our company's transformation. The changes take effect following our Annual Meeting on May 8th, and I look forward to collaborating with Matt on a different level in my new role. Matt and I have navigated our strategy together for years and he has been a terrific partner. We'll be continuing the productive relationship between the board and the executive team that have served our company so well for over a decade.","Now turning to the quarter. Overall, our performance was very positive. We know some of that our momentum to the operating environment our end markets are still growing, and demand is broad-based across our geographies and verticals. You saw us express our continued confidence in the cycle yesterday when we reaffirmed our guidance but it's more to an external. We're very different company today than we were a decade ago. We have former resilient business model. We're more agile and innovative with stronger differentiation and more ways to create value for our customers and shareholders. And you can see this in the growth that we've achieved the improvements we made in margins and returns, and the free cash flow we've generated throughout this cycle. And ultimately, you can see it in our return on capital. None of this happened by accident, it's the direct result of the strategy we adopted in 2008, and our focus on execution since that time.","And finally, I'd like to thank our employees for the incredible job they've done in helping us transform United Rentals. We had a vision for what this company could become, and our people made it a reality. And on a personal note, I want to thank you, the investment community, for your attention at United Rentals' during the years I've served as CEO. There has always been a lot of respect on both sides. And I'm pleased that I'll step down following a record year of growth and another year of growth well underway. Now, I hand the call over to Matt who will talk strategy and operations. And then Jessica will cover the numbers. After that we will take your questions.","So for the last time, Matt, over to you.","Matt Flannery","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. And before I begin, I want to take this opportunity on behalf of the Company to thank Mike for many years of tremendous leadership, hard work and selflessness and personally for his mentorship and the confidence he shown in me throughout my career. Mike has always been willing to challenge the status quo and to think in new directions, and always want new to push and pull those of us around them, quite frankly even when we didn\u2019t like it. The roles are changing Mike, but I'm counting on the continued collaboration and I'm very much looking forward to the next chapter of our lives together.","Now let's talk about quarter. As you know from the numbers, the year is off to a strong start. We delivered solid growth in good margins, as well as strong free cash flow. You've seen it in the results that we reported last night. For the quarter, total revenue was up 22% and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. And as a result, EPS improved by 15% from a year ago. This performance was underpinned by our focus on operational discipline. And it allowed the team to achieve solid flow through and a year-over-year improvement and fleet productivity was up 2.2% on a pro forma basis. And Jeff will go through the details. But bear in mind, we had multiple integrations to deal with, headwinds from the weather in Q1 and yet the team still became more efficient in capturing revenue.","And on the topic of integrations, let me take a moment to give you an update. The BlueLine integration is on track, and we'll be leveraging those additional resources in our busy season. The same is true on a smaller scale of WesternOne in Canada, and with Thompson Pump whose rental business we bought in January. Most of the structural integration work on these deals is behind us, and we're looking forward to the seasonal ramp up in Q2. We've entered 2019 not just as a larger solutions provider, but as a more diverse one as well, a quick to serve new types of customers and end markets. And this aligns well with our strategy and the outlook for the full year.","Our branches have the best view of market activity, and the teams are enthusiastic. And after some Q1 delays due to weather, projects are starting up at a good clip and most importantly, our customers are optimistic. And here's an overview of Q1. We saw meaningful growth in all three of our construction verticals of non-residential, infrastructure and residential. And in the industrial sector, all 12 of the verticals we track pointed to market strength with five of those verticals generating double-digit revenue growth for the quarter.","Geographically, we grew revenue in both the U.S. and Canada year-over-year with all of our regions showing strong demand. Our specialty operations continue to be a big part of our growth strategy. And in the first quarter, our Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions segment grew rental revenue by 44%. Now, this reflects our two acquisitions in Fluid Solutions, but also 12% -- 14% organic growth. When we bought BakerCorp back in July, we gained tank and filtration expertise. This strengthened our ability to provide Fluid Solutions to our customers. And with Thompson Pump, we gained a leading position in turnkey sewer bypass solutions and well point dewatering. In addition, we opened eight specialty cold starts in the first quarter against a planned 27 for the year. Our specialty footprint currently stands at a record 341 locations and growing.","Now, I want take a moment to talk about safety. It's our most important differentiator, because it protects our most important assets, our people and it matters to our customers. We just completed two years of acquisition activity with one integration after another. So it makes me particularly proud when I see a safety performance like the one we just achieved. For the first quarter, Team United had a total recordable rate of just 0.71. A year ago that rate was 0.98, which is a really good result for any industry. So we were good before and now we're even better. And to top it off, two of our regions ended the quarter with a recordable rate of zero. And someday, I hope to be telling you that the entire company came in at zero, because that's our goal.","But here is how I'll sum it up. The cycle's still in our favor and we're looking at another year of solid growth. Most important, our people, our processes and our strategy, are all aligned with the customer opportunity. You've heard us talk about balancing growth, margins, returns and free cash flow, that's our mantra. But before we do any of those things, we have to first perform for our customers. And we have to do it well enough to earn their next revenue opportunity each and every day.","This unrelenting focus on the customer is at the heart of Mike's legacy as CEO. His understanding of what it takes to build an enduring company set a high bar for us and our industry. Back in '09, he had us taking the lead with innovation and rental specialization. And we were engaging our employees in good citizenship and encouraging them to have an ownership mentality. And I know I speak for the entire team, when I say we're excited to build on Mike's legacy for all of our stakeholders. We're eager to take on the opportunities 2019 and the years ahead.","And now, I'll ask Jess to go over the numbers and then we'll take your questions. So Jess, over to you.","Jessica Graziano","Thanks Matt and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the numbers, on a high level, let me reiterate what Matt said. We've delivered a solid quarter and we're positioned well moving into the busy season. Our team did a great job remaining focused on safety and on our customers as we continue to work through multiple integrations. As a result of all that acquisition activity, the majority of the year-over-year variances in the as reported numbers will be from adding these businesses.","So while I walk you through as reported results, I'll pivot at times to speak to our performance on a pro forma basis, which includes BlueLine and Baker, since that's a better reflection of how we're managing the business. I'll begin with rental revenue where I'll also pivot to discuss the quarter in the context of fleet productivity. Last quarter, you'll recall that we said we will be providing rate, time view and mix detail consistent with our previous methodology for a couple of quarters to provide transition to fleet productivity. You can see all that detail, as well as calculations supporting fleet productivity on pages 36 through 40 of our investor presentation that\u2019s posted on our Web site.","So let's get started. Rental revenue on an as reported basis grew 23%, or $336 million to just shy of $1.8 billion. The increase is primarily related to the impact of both BlueLine and Baker, but I'll note here that the growth in rental revenue on a pro forma basis was a strong 7.2% for the quarter. As reported OER growth contributed about 21% or $265 million. From a fleet productivity perspective, the change is comprised of growth in our fleet of 23.7% or about $300 million of additional revenue. We have the usual headwind of fleet inflation at 1.5% or $19 million and fleet productivity on an as reported basis was also an expected headwind, down 1.3% or $16 million with lower time utilization and mix formatting BlueLine and Baker being partially offset by positive rate.","As you consider the quarter's revenue results, I think it's more helpful to consider fleet productivity on a pro forma basis, which was up 2.2% year-over-year. That came from both strong rate and mix, offset partially by softer time view. We focused on profitable growth while balancing these metrics for the quarter. And when you add the expected integration dynamics with some unexpected weather impacts, we're pleased with the productivity we generated.","Rounding rental revenue was a combined 2.1% increase on an as reported basis from ancillary and re-rent, with ancillary adding $61 million and re-rent adding $10 million. Again, both were better, primarily as a result of that BlueLine and Baker, but also due to better volume across the core business.","Taking a look at used sales, used sales revenue was up just over 6% or $11 million year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin on used sales was 49%, that's down from 54%, and reflects the tough comp of having sold older fully depreciated NES equipment in the first quarter of '18. As we look closer at the used sales environment, it remains strong. Our sales as a percentage of OEC was 54%, which was 140 basis points higher than last year with our used pricing at retail up about 5% versus Q1 '18. Used sales also benefited from the blend of equipment that we sold in the quarter.","Moving to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $921 million, an increase of $141 million or 18% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.5%, a 150 basis point decline year-over-year due largely to the impact of bringing in BlueLine and Baker. Importantly, on a pro forma basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 30 basis points.","I'll walk you through the bridge on the as reported changes in EBITDA. The improvement in OER added $167 million, ancillary contributed $19 million and re-rent provided about $1 million. Used sales were a headwind of about $3 million and SG&A expenses also a headwind of about $52 million. $40 million of that SG&A change comes from the BlueLine and Baker cost base net of synergies. The remaining $12 million includes volume and inflationary increases, such as higher commissions, merit and professional fees. And that leaves about $9 million of benefits in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, primarily coming from better performance across our other lines of business.","Adjusted EBITDA flow through for the quarter was approximately 37%. That's as reported and largely impacted by the acquisitions. So I'll isolate where the core business came in for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for BlueLine and Baker, flow through was about 48%. Add to that the impact of Western One and Thomson Pump, which together added about $35 million in revenue and $10 million in EBITDA for the quarter, and you get the 57% flow through.","Now, when we adjust for the impact of new and used sales and reflect the benefit of synergies from the acquisitions that leaves you with a flow through of about 52% for the core business. That was as expected for the quarter and points to a really good start to the year on cost performance. As for adjusted EPS, $3.31 in the quarter compared with $2.87 in Q1 of '18, an increase of 15%. And that's primarily from better operating performance across the business, including the contributions of the recent acquisitions.","Let's move to CapEx and free cash flow. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $257 million, that's about 12% of our full-year guidance at midpoint and in line with our 2019 plan, free cash flow in the quarter very strong, up 11% to $583 million. And just to be clear, that number excludes about $8 million in merger and restructuring payments.","Our ROIC for the quarter also strong 10.9%, which meaningfully exceeded our estimated weighted average cost to capital. Year-over-year our tax adjusted ROIC was down slightly 10 basis points. And that slight decline is primarily impacted by the expected timing drag from the acquisitions. And that's going to moderate as we get their operations more fully integrated and synergies from the deals fully realized.","Let's take a look at the balance sheet. Net debt at March 31st was $11.6 billion. That's an increase of about $2.7 billion year-over-year related to the financing of the BlueLine and Baker deals. Net debt was down about $150 million quarter-over-quarter. Our total liquidity at March 31st was a robust $2.25 billion, and that's comprised mainly of ABL capacity. Leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times on an as reported basis. And as a reminder, you've heard us say that we expect our leverage by the end of the year to be about 2.5 times, or the low end of our range.","Finally, here is a quick update on the share repurchase program. We purchased $210 million of stock in the first quarter on our currently $1.25 billion program, which puts us at $630 million purchase to-date. We still expect to complete this program by year-end. And I'll note that our diluted share count at the end of the first quarter was down about 6% year-over-year.","So as you've heard us say this morning, we delivered solid growth and good margins, as well as robust free cash flow. The operating environment is healthy and our customer confidence measures remain positive. Our end markets are still growing and demand is broad based across our geographies and verticals. This strong start to the year positions us well as we move into the busier part of the year. We're tracking to plan and remain confident about 2019 as we reaffirmed out guidance.","Now, let's move on to your questions. So operator, would you please open the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","One operational question and one more about the balance sheet. In light of having absorbed that much fleet from the acquisitions, you got hit with weather a little bit during the quarter. If you think about the way the rates played out for the quarter with that fleet utilization as challenged as it was. How is that coloring how are you looking for the rest of the year? I'm just curious if you had known the fleet utilization was coming in at down 18 for the quarter as reported. How is that versus your expectations and how do you respond on rate? And how is that coloring your thought looking at the rest of the year on rate and fleet productivity? I'm just curious if you get an update three months later how the first quarter is coloring your view on the rest of the year operationally?","Matt Flannery","So I think you bring up a great point. And it's -- and I'm not talking about 1.5%, the 150 bps pro forma, because that's now we think about the business. So when I think about either one of those, the time utilization performance was much more -- first of all, most of it was expected as we brought the BlueLine Fleet in November. Normally, we wouldn't bring in that much capacity in November as we're getting into the down season. So we expected most of that. But then the weather did amplified a little bit. If it was all just -- if it was demand based or if it was a concern that way then I think that rate performance would've been even tougher. But I look at it as the team did a very good job of not letting the temporary time utilization drag from the acquisition impact or influence losing any discipline on rate.","So we're very pleased with that outcome. We think we're not -- as you know, we don't forecast rate times externally, but we internally have goals and markers. And I think the team did a good job of offsetting that extra time that was created by the weather drag with great discipline from a rate perspective. So we're very pleased with that.","David Raso","I mean, we're all trying to figure out we have to still assume some kind of rate, some kind of view to get the fleet productivity number. And as the comps get a little harder on rate for the rest of the year and specialty double stack the comps. Just trying to understand if we will make our own assumptions about rate, obviously, the time you sound like something as you absorb the fleet, we get into the seasonally stronger periods. You'd think that the utilizations drag year-over-year diminishes. Can you help us a little bit trying to think through fleet productivity when it comes to mix? Can you at least maybe start with trend and how you talk about the business? Can you help us a bit when we think about mix the rest of the year and how it could influence fleet productivity in the overall numbers? Can you just give some examples or how the business is playing out? How you can best position a better mix?","Matt Flannery","So, obviously, two of the big drivers in mix are rate and time. But I mean, I am sorry not just the mix in fleet productivity. But when you think about that mix component, sometimes it's just additive but there are other times where it's actually influencing the other metrics. For example, if we grow specialty products more than we expected, that's going to be a drag on the time but we will get a positive offset to it on mix. So it's just hard of us to forecast that's why we don't. These are all outputs. I would say that as Jess said in her opening comments, we're off to a strong start of the year. We're on target and for everything that's embedded within our guidance.","And if you want to go on the margins of time a little bit whereas rate a little bit better, that's fair. But how that plays out into mix is really going to depend on what assets we end up growing with, with the remainder of our capital guide for the rest of the year and what the customers need and how that changes. So I'm not trying to be avoided just truly, those are all outputs from what we expect. The good news is we expect labor productivity to be strong, because the demand is strong. And that's the correlation I draw. When we look at the data that not necessarily everybody sees anymore, we've seen 31 consecutive months of positive balance of supply and demand. That\u2019s with the overall market expectations that we have of strong end markets, we think will result in strong performance as we've guided.","David Raso","That's part of the question I'm just trying to figure if something's changed in the last three months that's maybe changing your capital allocation, be it where you're looking at putting more capital to work, even shifting fleet around the country geographically. Just trying to get a feel for how things could change a little bit from three months ago. But it seem like there's a notable change in how you think about mix and how that influences fleet productivity the rest of the year, that's all, more specialty versus gen ren or vice versa.","Matt Flannery","No, there's no change. And to be frank, Q1 we said this many times. Q1's way too early and too small a sample set to have any change on a full year to positive or negative. And we feel that way today. We're happy to be on track but absolutely no change to the way we're looking at it and what we've got embedded in our guidance in all of our metrics that we get.","David Raso","And I've a question on the balance sheet, I mean the way you're targeting the end of the year at 2.5 turns. We can debate macro 2020 or not. But if we just assume for a second, it was still a decent year, it does appear one of the challenging if you applied most the cash flow next year to deleveraging, and you grow the EBITDA a little bit. I mean, it's pretty easy to see how you can get down to it to turn leverage. Given your midpoint of the target still 3. Can you give us some milestones to think about as a year plays out in discussions with the board, coming to a conclusion, if that's still the appropriate target? Is it at that phase? I mean, you're going to be a bigger company. I mean, one turn in leverage is almost going to be like a $5 billion number. And I'm not even sure the acquisition can abate that, out there you could add up to any on your $5 billion. So just kind of get some understanding of how do we think about milestones discussing this with the board, things that we should be on a lookout for?","Jessica Graziano","It's a great question, and a conversation that's very topical for us as a management team and also with our board. We also -- let me say here that just in all the conversations that we also have with investors, we appreciate and we consider the feedback that we get from investors as well. As you noted, we expect we're going to finish 2019 at 2.5 times and we feel really good about that, considering the focus this year is going to include absorbing all that acquisition activity. And as we look beyond that 2020 and to your point, we can debate the macro. But as we look beyond that right now, it's really premature for us to make a call on how that could change our capital allocation strategy specifically.","Between now and then though, we will have a formal conversation with our Board as part of our annual review of capital allocation. And while there's no news to share right now, of course, obviously, if something happens, we'll share it. What I will say even though it's not new news it's good news. The balance sheet right now is in a really good place. Our debt maturity schedule pushed out significantly. We're generating meaningful cash flow. So the focus is going to continue to think about our capital allocation strategy that's going to be both balanced and dynamic for us going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","I just wanted to ask about now your comment that industry demand growth has exceeded supply growth for 31 consecutive months. If you could just give us a little bit of flavor as to whether or not that GAAP has been widening or narrowing over, say relative to the last six months. I mean I realized it's probably volatile month-to-month but maybe on some type of take on like a trailing average versus where we were say mid-year last year?","Matt Flannery","Yes, it's been really consistent really for the past four to six quarters, I'd say. So what I like -- that give you knowledge in a month you may have 10 bps here, 10 bps there up and down. But when you plot it across the last year plus, it's been really consistent and strong. So it's at a good level. And I think you're seeing that in the results. And I think it says a lot just not about us but about the industry discipline, which we're very pleased with.","Ross Gilardi","And just further on that, on that demand versus supply comparison, can you give us some directional view on where industry supply growth is running right now on a run rate basis?","Matt Flannery","I don\u2019t have the granularity of that data. But once again, I would just say on the amount of equipment that's been observed versus the amount equipment that's been purchased is in really good balance right now. So, the spread is healthy, I think that's why you are seeing us in our peers report the results we are reporting and I think, it's really a positive sign all underpinned by the demand environment, which has really been very broad as we've discussed over multiple quarters.","Ross Gilardi","And then just -- so maybe just a follow-up on the comments that you were just making before on capital allocation. Clearly, the Company is going through a lot of discussion and you're talking to the board and you've got the AGM coming up and so forth. Do you expect to give us any type sense of timing as to when you might get back to the market on any potential changes, if there are any?","Michael Kneeland","Hi, this is Michael. Obviously, leveraging capital allocation is critically important for both the management team and the board of directors, something that we actually spend a lot of time on thinking about, including getting investor input is as Jessica mentioned, about how to maximize our potential into benefit of our shareholders. Obviously, it's something that we are going through at the moment and before coming -- in our upcoming board meetings. But obviously, when there is nothing to announce today, but be assured that it's something where we would be definitely proactive and coming forward in making announcements. So, it's very much on our radar and we're going to be something that will tackle as the board with the management.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your question please.","Rob Wertheimer","I had a question just on specialty and it is, I guess, using Baker as a platform, can you talk a bit about how your operational improvement, your toolkits, all the things you do to make businesses better have you have gone at Baker? Are they working just as well or given that's a little bit on extension? Is there less real improvements that you've bought and then maybe if you could talk about cross-selling as well in that context?","Matt Flannery","Sure, Rob. This is Matt. So, in the scheme of things, it's still early. But I will say in the past 7 to 8 months, there has been a lot of work done and it's really not just Baker that the fluid solutions team is dealing, they're dealing with Thompson as well. So, what they're really working on is the consolidation of offering, not necessarily even in stores, but the consolidation of offering to become a true fluid solutions provider. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Thompson's added to that with some expertise in sewer bypass and wellpoint dewatering.","So, there I'd say the biggest change that we are seeing is the ability to enhance the go-to-market strategy. So, we think that's going to be received very well by the end markets. As far as the tactical integration pieces, the team has been ahead of that and as I've said most of that's underway. Now, it's the go-to-market strategy. How do we get to customers to understand this new? And in many ways, unique provider in that space is really the strategic reason of why we did these deals and the opportunity ahead. So, we feel good about it. It's on target, but we think there's a lot more room in the customer facing side to change the game.","Rob Wertheimer","And if you look at kind of what you can bring to acquisitions obviously in the core general ones you're exceptionally good at it. Do you feel like the value that you can bring in, in different fields within specialty where as you expand out in specialty. Is it just as large? Or is it -- the end market has been more attractive to sort of make the math work out evenly between the two options?","Matt Flannery","So, we think the opportunity is large, right. So, one of our core competencies is to take the relationships, the right of way that the goodwill that we have as a strong provider for our customers and expand out. That's really how has been a big part of the growth of our specialty business. And then as far as where and what is both opportunistic, and then strategically, we have to make that build versus buy decisions every time that we look at a deal. But I think it's safe to say whether traditional products or services in specialty or in other adjacencies of the business, there's a lot of growth opportunity for us and something strategically that we continue to evaluate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please.","Joe O'Dea","First question just for CapEx, I think, you've touched the amount that you've spent in the first quarter. It was a little bit lighter than what you normally do. I think if we go back overtime, you've normally spent at least 50% of the full year CapEx usually closer to 60% in the first half of the year, which would suggest something like a $1 billion in 2Q. And so, I wanted to get a sense of whether or not that's kind of a reasonable target or, or whether the spend plans for the year might shape toward the lower half of guidance?","Matt Flannery","Sure, Joe. So to be clear, the Q1 CapEx was a shade lighter than what you see standard, but that was really planned and it was because of the BlueLine acquisition. So as you can imagine, with working that extra capacity, which was very heavily aerial waited, we didn't buy as much aerial in Q1 as we may have in past years because we have the extra capacity. So, that's just smart fleet management. You're numbering Q2 is not far off the pace and whether we go above or below that number, it will be directly correlated to how fast we move that extra fleet through the network.","But overall, we have no changes to the full year CapEx guidance. And within that range that we've given in CapEx this year, you could think about the faster we move the BlueLine fleet through, right. Then we'll be on the higher end of the range, and the slower we move it through it and be on the lower end of the range. So, it's really going to be responsive. We think that's how we always look at CapEx and no change to the full year plan.","Joe O\u2019Dea","And so, the toggle there is really more around replacement spend and growth spend than presumably is still kind of in line with initial expectations?","Matt Flannery","Yes, that's fair. We're definitely in line with initial expectation. Nothing's changed from that perspective. The end markets are still there for the opportunities that. And frankly, as specialty continues to show really strong growth, if there is extra capacity, that doesn't mean that they won't try to take more of the new CapEx because they have been very effective at turning into growth and profitability.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Perfect. And then just moving on to BlueLine and Baker, two quick questions. One, if you could just talk about the cost synergy kind of target for 2019, and how much of that was achieved in the first quarter? And two, if you could talk about BlueLine rate harmonization, obviously the timing of acquiring that maybe shifts a little bit of the opportunity set more into kind of 2Q 3Q'19 for some of that harmonization, but just to understand, kind of what that looks like?","Jessica Graziano","It's Jess. So, what we have realized in synergies in the first quarter is about $16 million, total, between BlueLine and Baker together, and when we look at it on sort of full year '19 we're looking at something like $45 million incremental total.","Joe O'Dea","That's helpful. And then on the\u2026","Matt Flannery","As far as -- Yes -- so as far as the rates, I mean, as I said about really much of the integration, and as you saw in the numbers Jess just gave you as far as the synergies. Most of the structural work done, meaning territory realignment, customer harmonization, at this point, whether it's a Baker or United legacy or BlueLine legacy customer, we've got them all in our rate zones, we've got them all through our methodology, how we move suggested rates and opportunities in rate management through our sales teams, they're all one right now.","So it's probably structurally under way. And as far as where the opportunity is, I think you've seen a little bit of it. You look at the pro forma versus the as reported rate improvement, it was a little bit higher than the pro forma, that's a tip to the half with teams already started, and we think we'll see that kind of pace continue through the back half of the year when you look at pro forma versus as reported.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Seth Weber","So, Matt, I think you commented that you're starting to see, there were some projects that may have gotten pushed due to weather here in the first quarter that are you don't know were kind of restarting in the second quarter. I'm trying to kind of just tie your confidence -- the confidence that you're talking to, in the end markets against like the ABI that came out yesterday that showed some softness, the first softness in a while. So maybe can you just give us what's -- any more detail on kind of how much visibility you feel like you have and what's really supporting your confidence through the full year, frankly? Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Sure. Well, first and foremost, what gives us that confidence is the 1,200 touch points we have in our branch network with a couple of thousand reps that talk to customers every day. So that is always going to be primary. But then most every macro data point supports that feeling and even within the ABIs that was released I think it was even noted in the report that they believe that it was due to weather. I mean February was a tough weather month for us and for the industry and for job starts.","So we're not surprised by that, but also what came out this morning is the ABC's construction backlog indicator, which was up 8% month-over-month. So in balance we say all the macro indicators are positive even in spite of the ABI number that just came out. So we feel really good about it. Our customers feel good about it. And as we've said before, we think we have good strong visibility 12 months out and that's because of our connection to the end markets and to our customers.","And I don't see anything that points to a concern within that visibility that we feel we already have. So I get the point about ABI that one dataset, we'll see where that ends up in the oncoming months, when the February weather hangover goes away, but we still feel good about the end market.","Seth Weber","And then maybe just going back to the mix discussion, is there anything you'd call out there from an energy market perspective, that's disproportionately helping the mix, either from a rate or utilization perspective, or how would you kind of characterize energy markets at this point, I know you mentioned Canada overall -- anything else you could add? Thanks.","Matt Flannery","I call the energy markets steady and certainly they didn't have any impact on mix, as far as the way we categorize mix. When we think broadly, the interesting thing about this last couple of years is that whether you look at geography, vertical, product lines, the growth has been very broad. There's no hot pocket we're relying on and and we feel good about that and and we're forecasting that to continue throughout the year and most of the backlog information and the customer information fortifies that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","Steven Fisher","Just on the flow-through, curious what the expectation is that you have for the balance of the year. Should we assume that 60% is achievable on a quarterly basis or will that drag from some of those acquisitions linger on for a little while?","Jessica Graziano","Hi, Steve, it's Jess. Yes, I mean, when we look at the flow-through that we generated in the first quarter, it was actually a hair better than what we expected. So if I go back to the conversation we had at Investor Day when we talked through full-year guidance, we still feel really comfortable that we'll be able to do something kind of give or take 60% on the core, if I adjust for the acquisitions and for the synergies. So Yes, we feel really good about 60%.","Steven Fisher","And then, if you could just talk about your bid pipeline a little bit, particularly in terms of large projects, it seems like maybe following up on Seth's question there, there should be some larger industrial projects that are taking shape at the moment and I know in the past you've also had some chunky CapEx put out there for specific airport projects. I'm just curious what your bid pipeline looks like for some of the larger projects at this point that you see coming over the next year.","Matt Flannery","Sure, Steve. It looks robust, our national account team and our strategic account teams, which are really the large or half of our account profile, backlogs are strong, and they're the ones that are going to be working on the major projects. LNG is still strong. There's still a lot of infrastructure work, major capital projects remain robust and and it's coast to coast.","I mean there is strength throughout our network and then when you even think about some of the midstream work that needs to get done to help move some of the energy, is really an opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with the contractors that are going to be doing that large work through our scale and through our broad foot print.","Steven Fisher","Is there any particular timing that you see for some of those projects coming through?","Matt Flannery","That's probably a little too precise for us right now, but I would say the pace of how our our teams are building their revenue and what our expectations are for the year which obviously informed our guidance, is on track as far as where that moves, does Q2 get a little hotter or as as expected, it's probably too early for us to say.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citi. Your question please.","Tim Thein","So, the first question is just on operating costs and how that is impacting the margins here for 2019. This point last year, it was more of a challenging backdrop in terms of your pickup and delivery and some of the other operating buckets, as you've highlighted in the flow-through bridge, so just curious how much of the improvement that you have seen, how much of it is just that maybe some loosening of the LTL capacity versus some of the things that maybe you've done internally to recover some of that inflation that you've faced?","Jessica Graziano","So, I don't have that number isolated. But what I can tell you is, as we looked at cost performance through the first quarter, we were very pleased. The performance came in pretty much as expected across those big categories of cost that gave us a little bit of heartburn first quarter last year like delivery was one and we had also talked about some higher overtime than we expected. So, the team has done a great job in managing through that and managing through some of the integration work that we've had through the first quarter to stay really focused on a disciplining cost when it -- as it related to again these big categories delivery repair labor cost like that. So, there is nothing that we're seeing that that we would isolate as being a concern for us as we're going into the busy season.","Tim Thein","Okay. I mean, there was -- it's also just in the context of some fairly sizable percentage growth and not a huge driver for URI on the whole, but the ancillary was up quite a bit as in percentage terms. So, I guess I was just curious if there is -- if there were things that have been done there and that may be helping you recover some of the inflation?","Jessica Graziano","So a big chunk of that increase comes from better delivery recovery through ancillary and that is really the recovery of the cost that you would see within cost of rentals. There's two things going on there. One is that with the acquisitions, we've now modified processes, we've updated technologies, in bringing those businesses in, they're now using that same discipline that we've developed around delivery recovery being obviously an important part of our overall revenues. So that's part of it. The other part of it is that the team broadly continues to be really focused on making sure to have delivery recovery as appropriate across our sales. So it's -- it's good discipline and it's bringing in those two businesses that's driving growth in that line.","Tim Thein","Got it. Just following back up on rates just in the quarter, was there or were there any regions or geographies that stood out in terms of it being stronger versus softer, that just curious about anymore, whether it's by geography or vertical, any more color in terms of just rate performance and how that just in -- likely informs you about the rest of the year?","Matt Flannery","Tim, as you could imagine -- this is Matt, as you could imagine, the rate follows the demand, right. And it was equally as broad, every operating region had positive rates in the quarter year-over-year, so it should and did follow the demand environment, as that's really the driver for the opportunity and the team did a good job capturing that opportunity broadly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you can talk about -- I'm wondering if you can talk about the Total Control rollout on the acquired businesses and BlueLine, what's the timing, as we look at Total Control now, it's a quarter of your business, 5, 6 years ago was half that, as we continue the new migration toward more customers using Total Control. I guess, what are the implications for the margin profile for your business? Can you just step us through that opportunity set please?","Matt Flannery","Sure. Jerry. This is Matt. I'd say that the -- most importantly the team responded quickly to those customers that Baker was doing business with that were already on Total Control. So the first step was to make sure that we got those assets integrated in and that's some work and I want to get into the details, a part of that work actually has to happen on the customers' end as well, because they build processes through to their vendors, so they had the more fad over.","And then in BlueLine deal, you had a little bit of as well more influenced by Baker than BlueLine, but certainly an opportunity for us to continue to be a full provider to those Total Control customers and I wouldn't say there were any material changes especially when you look at the pro forma growth.","But what I would say is broadly regardless of integrations and acquisitions, we continue to get further adoption and usage of Total Control as a tool to help our customers solve productivity issues and that's always what it's been built on and as we put it along our footprint and get more and more of our employees and therefore customers educated on the opportunity, that's how we've driven that growth in Total Control.","Jerry Revich","And Matt, could you comment on part of the question related to the margin opportunity sets where obviously you're getting benefits of digital transactions and also better customer stickiness as the Total Control part of your business grows. Can you just address that part of the question in terms of opportunity set if we're sitting here in five years and it's 40% of your business, can you just help us understand what that means from a margin standpoint?","Matt Flannery","Yes, neither one of the digital channels or any kind of automation is really done as from a cost to margin perspective, it's really done for meeting the customer where they are, the customers that want to interact with us in that way, we're going to support that and that's why we're building the digital platforms that we are, so we don't see this as huge margin accretion opportunity as much as the other half of your point which is accurate is the stickiness, right.","And we've got to -- we've got to transact with customers in the way they will process this and comfort in transacting and that's more of why you'll see this us do that. What it does give us the opportunity to do is maybe reach some broader customers that we weren't reaching before. This technology gives you a wider net to cast. So I'd say it's more from that perspective than a cost to margin translation.","Jerry Revich","And then your used pricing, you mentioned that retail was up 5% in the quarter, which is really good performance compared to what we are seeing for the industry overall in that auction results. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the used market is the soft spot really just Tier 4 equipment that you're now not transacting because all of your sales are to Tier 3, can you just talk about your views of the used market and how you folks were able to deliver such better retail sales performance compared to what we're seeing in the channel?","Matt Flannery","Sure, this is something that we've been very proud of and we've worked hard on to build over multiple years. So this isn't a new thing for us. It's that our sales folks were involved in retailing equipment. We have a firm belief that we want to solve all of our customers' problems and just because we're rental company the customer wants to buy a piece of equipment, we've got good quality, well-maintained used equipment to sell to them and we use the retail channel to do that and I think that is the single-digit biggest differentiation between our margins and those that don't do that, but even within the auction results, you see, that it was a little bit of a drag. When you look at the aerial products reaches, they were still pretty strong. So I don't see Tier 4 as the big mover here. I see this is strictly as our channel and the products we sell giving us a good opportunity to keep margins strong and pricing strong.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Chad Dillard","So I just want to tie a couple data points together from the call, so I mean it sounds like you guys are seeing -- you saw some push out of activity from 1Q in 2Q, that impacted your utilization and also it sounds like that you may be able to catch up CapEx kind of -- like your seasonally normal CapEx schedule. So like against that backdrop, how should we think about the cadence of fleet productivity as it goes in the balance of the year?","Matt Flannery","Chad, this is Matt. I just want to correct one thing in case we misspoke or you misheard. The slower time utilization in Q1 was primarily due to -- we did the second biggest acquisition in our history in November, which was going into the seasonal down curve, right, of demand. Not macro activity, not anything like that, just working that fleet through and all the other integration processes that are normal for us, and if we could have bought that fleet in April, we wouldn't be -- you wouldn't even see it, but the truth, we had the opportunity to buy in November, by the way, we do that all over again.","We're very pleased with the BlueLine deal, that's what we did -- the two things that you referred to, dampen time utilization, which we expected in Q1 and we'll see that play out through the first half of the year and a tick down, maybe $20 million, $25 million less capital spend than we would have had we not done that deal. I just don't want anybody misunderstand and think that we were -- we are blaming that activity, we think the demand is robust and we'll just work that through the system.","So I just wanted to correct that. And then as we think about fleet productivity, as I said in the earlier point, I think it was Ross who might have asked the question earlier, or David, the fleet productivity metrics and output. So not anymore than we could forecast rate or time which are the two biggest inputs to fleet productivity will we be able to have the ability to forward forecast that metric, but we do think that demand environment's and what's embedded within our guidance will net us positive operating metrics and we'll report them accurately as we get through the quarters.","Chad Dillard","And also can you give us your updated thoughts on your philosophy and current decision on whether to potentially implement a dividend, by the end of the year, I mean you will be at the lower end of your leverage target and sounds like M&A or probably more tuck-in rather than large transformational, so just kind of help me think through where could the balance of excess cash go between maybe dividend or more buyback?","Jessica Graziano","Hey, Chad. I'll actually come back to the question that David asked and my answer around, there's really no new news for us right now as far as changes to our capital allocation strategy and as we continue to have conversations internally and with our board about that and we consider dividends as just one part of an overall strategy, we will obviously update everyone accordingly.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.","A - Matt Flannery","Actually operator, this is Matt, and I just want to thank everyone for joining the call and remind you all that our Q2 investor deck is available for download and it had some really good information on much of the stuff you asked about today, fleet productivity, that's worth a look. So, please reach out to Ted Grace, our Head of HR, if you have any questions. And I look forward to sharing more of our progress with you in July.","So with that, operator, please go ahead and end the call.","Operator","Thank you.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m always proud to represent United Rentals on these calls, but today as a special significance for me. Our company will turn 20 years old this year and it\u2019s been quite a journey so far and our best years are still ahead of us. So it\u2019s fitting that we start the next 20 years with a major announcement to acquire NES Rentals, one of the ten largest equipment rental companies in North America. I\u2019m not going to reiterate everything you saw in the release, because I want to leave time for your questions, but I want to emphasize how favorably we view this deal.","Both as an attractive use of capital and also as an investment that\u2019s in lockstep with our strategy for profitable growth, our core business, our culture and our people. With NES, we\u2019re gaining a great group of people who share our intense focus on customer service. And when we\u2019re working side by side throughout the integration to capitalize on the best in class expertise from both sides. And we look forward to giving our new employees even more opportunities as part of our larger organization. I also want to mention that we\u2019re in a \u2013 where is our own toughest customer when it comes to M&A. We look at a lot of proposals and pursue very few of them and acquisition has to make sense at every level. In this case, we\u2019re buying NES and an attractive multiple using available cash and borrowing capacity and gaining broad based accretion to earnings, revenue, EBITDA in free cash flow.","In addition, the strategic rationale is compelling. While NES serves the same construction in industrial markets that we do, their footprint customer base in fleet a commentary to what in many respects. For an example NES has extensive relationships with local and strategic accounts. This will help diversify our customer base and this nicely with our go to market strategy. It should also accelerate the cross selling of our services including our specialty fleet. And the timing is ideal to take advantage of an expanding marketplace. We\u2019ve also identified meaningful synergies that will be pursuing to integration. Some of this with the natural outcome of combination, of others like purchasing efficiencies that will come to scale. So this investment can be characterized as the right assets, right timing, right people, right place and the right price.","In the middle, I\u2019ll talk more about our operating environment, but I first want to summarize 2016 and the performance of our current operations. Our financial results and our view of the cycle are both important narratives today. The NES acquisition while important for other reasons to be seen as the latest execution of our ongoing strategy for value creation. So starting with the fourth quarter, we were very pleased with the way our business performed. Rental revenue, OEC on rent, and time utilization, all increased versus year-ago. And while rates continue to lag that are well within our projected range. On a monthly sequential basis, we gain momentum going to 2017, and our OEC on rent was particularly strong through December.","Turning to the full year, we delivered solid results in the year that has share of headwinds, starting with the global economic concerns in the first quarter and then ongoing drags from upstream oil and gas or weak Canadian economy and industry over fleeting.","Despite these constraints, we exceeded the upper band of our guidance on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. In fact, the $1.18 billion of free cash flow we generated was a record for us. Our results in 2016 were driven by a combination of positive internal and external dynamics.","The internal push came in a large part from our strategic approach the business development. For example, we signed new customers and targeted verticals. We grew our specialty operations and employed a surgical use of CapEx to expand our fleet, all while maintaining cost discipline. The external pool came from broad-based demand across geographies and project types led by commercial construction.","And we are pleased to see our confidence in the cycle reflected in the market behavior. And we believe the cycle remains intact and that demand will continue to trend up in 2017. In the U.S., there\u2019s obvious from industry optimism about the focus of the new administration. In our opinion, it\u2019s too early to call. It\u2019s a government spending stimulates construction it will be incremental to a cycle that we already see as positive for our business.","I want to give you a quick rundown of the four additional factors we considered and formulating our view. First, there are number of favorable U.S. indicators of 2017, including the Dodge construction outlook, contractor backlogs, national surveys by key trade groups, and importantly CEO confidence surveys. These are the people making spending decisions to create jobs for our customers.","IHS market, our industry\u2019s primary forecasting firm, projects 3% to 4% growth for the U.S. rental industry this year. Second, there \u2013 appears to be on more of a balance between supply and demand. If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx spending, the absorption rate for excess fleet should accelerate. Until then, we expect to see more of our growth come from volume other than rate.","Third, customer surveys in the quarter showed a positive trend. More than half of the respondents cited an improving outlook for 2017, while only 5% pointed to a declining outlook. And at the same time, U.S. consumers\u2019, home builders, and small businesses reported higher confidence levels in December. So there\u2019s no disconnect here.","And fourth, we have the benefit of almost 900 branches with connections to hundreds of local markets. This gives us an ongoing access that industries largest volume of empirical data, operating information and customer touch points. More immediately, our fourth quarter results reflected a healthy level of demand. We increased our average daily OEC on rate year-over-year in a majority of the states and provinces where we operate.","In the U.S., the coastal states continue to outpace the country as a whole. This is particularly true in the Southeast. Our double-digit revenue growth was driven by commercial construction of warehousing, data centers, and mixed use facilities. Further up the coast we\u2019re on a casino project, power plants, as well as the major airport expansion.","Out west, we saw nearly $7 billion of large multi-year projects start up in California last quarter, with Washington, Oregon, and Arizona expected to follow suit by March. These range from stadiums and transit projects to healthcare, solar, automotive, and corporate campuses. And we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that Canada has turned the corner. The fourth quarter marked a first uptick in oil and gas activity in Canada since 2014.","And GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 2% this year aided in part by the rebalanced commodity prices. Our specialty segment continued to outperform in the quarter, rental revenue for Trench, Power and Pump increased by approximately 5%, 17% and 10% respectively from the prior year. We opened a total of 14 specialty branches in 2016 and plan to open another 17 this year. As we said in our Investor Day, our long-term goal remains to grow our specialty business to $2 billion of revenue.","Now in 2016, the bulk of specialties top line growth came from same-store performance. This was driven by standalone demand for the services and by cross-selling our specialty fleet to our general rental customers. Cross-selling remains an important part of our company wide plan to cement customer loyalty and boost return on assets. In 2016, we generated 13% more revenue from cross-selling our fleet to national accounts versus the prior year. And with NES on board, well thousands of new customers that can use our services.","So to circle back what I said earlier, we believe that this is a critical year in terms of timing. In addition to expanding to M&A and our specialty cold starts will be funding a series of exciting initiatives to enhance the long-term earning power of the business. We announced this on Investor Day in December under the name Project XL. Executing this plan now, we believe, we can capitalize more fully on the cycle and realize attractive dividends for years to come.","One area of investment is technology, we\u2019ll be expanding our digital strategy and our total control fleet management software to create more of a competitive mode. And we\u2019ll continue to explore new verticals that offer potential synergies with our existing customer base. This year we\u2019ll spend about $200 million more of CapEx versus 2016 based on current operations in part to serve different types of customers and markets associated with these initiatives.","And we\u2019re focusing on aspects of the business that are within our control with the potential to permanently enhance our industry position and future profitability. These growth investments are baked into our guidance, we issued for 2017 and once we complete the purchase of NES we\u2019ll issue new guidance for the combined operation.","So this is where we start to narrative for 2017 at the threshold of our next 20 years. Poised to capitalize on a healthy marketplace with an exciting acquisition on our doorstep and laser focus on opportunities. The agility to adjust to sudden changes and the experience to act not just as stewards of United Rentals but as catalyst for growth.","So with that, I\u2019ll ask Bill to cover the quarter and recap the year. And then we\u2019ll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. My comments this morning, I\u2019ll skinny down a little bit the commentary on Q4 and the year, so that we have a little time to talk about the NES transaction as well as our outlook for the year.","So let me start as always with the rental revenue in the quarter. Rental revenue was up 1.6% over the prior year or about $20 million of total change. Within that re-rent and ancillary, we\u2019re basically flat with last year. So the change was really in owned equipment revenue, volume was the major positive there, OEC on rent was up nicely in the quarter 4.3% that accounted for about $47 million of year-over-year rental revenue change.","Rate was the big headwind there, down 1.8% year-over-year for the quarter accounted for about $20 million of reduction versus last year. On the CapEx inflation front usual 1.5% or so, of a headwind there, that\u2019s about $17 billion of reduction versus last year. And then mix in other accumulates all the other impacts within that a number of different cross currents. One is the fact that the holidays fell on maybe a little bit of a fortunate part of the week, with Christmas and New Year\u2019s on Sunday\u2019s this year as oppose to Friday\u2019s the year before they hit us less than the last year in terms of what we see on rent during the work week.","So put it all together, that mix and another number was about $11 million positive versus last year. And that adds up the $20 million year-over-year change in rental revenue. There was no real currency impact in rental revenue for the quarter. The Canadian dollar was not significantly different this year than it was last year.","As speaking of Canada, it still remains somewhat of a headwind on a year-over-year basis. Rental revenue in Canada was down double digits, if you excluded that the U.S. only portion of our rental revenue was up 2.9% that compares to the 1.6% that we reported for the whole company. And that, that impact in Canada is basically the carryover from the decline that we\u2019ve been talking to in Canada for the last year plus.","This real briefly on used equipment sales down $22 million in proceeds from U.S sales year-over-year down to $135 million and that primarily flex. The smaller amount of OEC on rent that we sold this year compared to last year. The margin and price performance of our used sales were nice improvements over last year. Margin at \u2013 adjusted margin at 49.6%, 3.1 percentage points higher reflects nice price performance.","In fact, if you look at our proceeds as a percent of OEC, we realized 53.4% of the original cost back through used equipment proceeds that 60 basis points better than it was last year and reflects a pricing environment, which has turned more positive over the last number of months. So we\u2019re encouraged by not only what that sales were used sales proceeds, but also what it might say about the direction of demand in the marketplace.","On adjusted EBITDA going through the bridge there $749 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. That\u2019s $5 million better than last year and 49.2% margin, which is 30 basis points better. Volume accounted for $32 million of improvement over last year and then rental rates went against that for about $19 million of declined reflecting the volume and rate environment that we talked about previously.","Fleet inflation was also a headwind down $12 million year-over-year and used sales, the $5 million declined in used sales profit was a contributor of headwind. A merit impact was the usual roughly $5 million this year and the bonus accrual was also a headwind in the quarter kind of for about $10 million of decline versus last year. When you look at the rest the remaining $24 million is a combination of other cost improvements across the wide variety of cost items and they reflect the impact primarily of our focus on cost through our lean initiatives and other areas. So lumping the cost improvements together including bad debt improvements the little bit of an assurance reserve adjustment and other cost saves the total to about $16 million of improvement versus last year and then that leaves $8 million or so of mix and other.","Regarding our lean savings and other EBITDA improvement initiatives, we had been targeting as you all know the $100 million run rate of improvement by the end of 2016, pleased to say that we actually ended the year with a run rate of $110 million on that program. So it continues to reflect the effort of a lot of people really focusing on all of our processes across the company to drive improvement. And needless to say that focus will continue. We\u2019ve got a new energized set of initiatives that are part of the Project XL projects that Mike mentioned and we\u2019ll continue to report on progress on those initiatives as we go forward.","One of the standout measures for our quarter this year was free cash flow $1.182 as Mike said is a record, that $260 million improvement year-over-year roughly really reflects the impact of a couple of key items obviously it was benefited by the reduction in CapEx, but there were benefits in a number of different areas. So it was a very robust free cash flow result and helped us drive a significant reduction in our net debt. Net debt at the end of the year was down $500 million versus the prior year about 6% and it\u2019s very importantly reflected the impact of our free cash flow. That in fact includes the impact of our share repurchase on the year, which was a total of $517 million in the year.","Speaking of the share repurchase we are in the quarter spend about $40 million to bring that year-to-date program up to 517. And if you look at the program to date number its $627 million, so little over $370 million remains on the program as you all saw during the earnings release. We paused purchases under the program that $40 of purchases happened in the month of October, and obviously we paused as we were considering actually several acquisitions in addition to the NES acquisition that we\u2019ve announced.","As we complete the NES acquisition, as we start down and get deep into the integration. Our plan is to we evaluate where we are and how we want to approach the share repurchase program. Our intend is to continue to complete the program, but we feel it\u2019s prudent to re-evaluate where we are, see how the cash flow is shaping up as we get later in the year. And then make a separate decision about, when and how quickly we go back at the share repurchase program. So stay tuned on that front.","We did finish with significant liquidity as we always do at the end of the quarter, $1.2 billion in total liquidity and that includes just little over $800 million of ABL capacity and a little over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Just real quickly on the capital structure, you\u2019ve all seen the redemptions and new issuance that we\u2019ve done throughout the course of the year in service of the capital structure, just to call out one specific number of the impact of that going forward. We expect that along with the redemptions and restructuring and the reduction in debt that it will have a significant positive impact on our cash interest expense for next year. So we are expecting a reduction in cash interest of about $65 million in 2017 compared to 2016.","Last two points, the outlook and the NES transactions and then we will get to Q&A. On the outlook, you saw the numbers, I don\u2019t feel compelled to repeat them just a couple of points. First, we have said this before but just to reiterate the outlook removes this time rate and time utilization guidance and that\u2019s consistent with the philosophy that we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of quarters.","I will note that the EBITDA range that we gave, just to highlight does include some operating expense investments in support of some of the Project XL initiatives that we\u2019ve touched on in other areas, as well as other focused areas like our improvement in digital and marketing efforts and so forth.","On free cash flow the $650 million to $750 million range there reflects an increase in cash taxes that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time now. We expect 2017 cash tax is to be higher by about $260 million versus 2016, and when you combine that increase with the outflow for roughly $200 million more of CapEx. Those are the two significant drivers of our outlook for free cash flow coming down from the $1.182 billion this year to the $650 million to $750 million range for 2017.","We also will benefit from the cash interest reduction that I just pointed out, but working against that are the net operating profitability and working capital adjustment. So when you add all that up, you get to our outlook of $650 million to $750 million on free cash flow. The one other point I\u2019ll make on the outlook is that, again, I think we said this in the releases, but none of those numbers include the impact of NES, our plan is to provide combined company guidance for the remainder of the year at the point where we close NES. So stay tuned for that.","Further on NES, Mike hit the key points, but just to reiterate we think that the impact of NES with the customers that they bring the additional scale that it means for us. The improvement in the density of our network in certain key markets, the cross sell opportunities all are very key parts of the strategic rationale for doing this deal.","And then you set those alongside the cost synergies and the tax benefits and it makes we\u2019re very powerful financial view of the deal as well. But the cost synergies we are calling out is about $40 million, roughly $30 million of that number is from good old fashioned straight ahead corporate overhead and other sort of obvious operating efficiencies. The remainder is due to operational efficiencies that require a little bit more change in process and analysis before we can call out it specifically where they will come from. But based on our experience with RSC and other acquisitions we\u2019re very confident that the $40 million total of operating cost is very achievable synergy result.","When you synergies their EBITDA, there are $155 million of EBITDA from last year by the $40 million just to get a measure of the overall value of this deal. That $965 million purchase price divided by that synergised EBITDA comes down to a 4.9 times multiple that\u2019s pretty attractive by almost any standard, especially when you consider the multiple that we are trading at today.","When you further add in the effect of that tax benefit, which we calculate as a present value of about $125 million that brings the adjusted purchase price multiple down to 4.3 times. That\u2019s very attractive and that shows in the return profile of this acquisition. We expect that from an ROIC perspective it\u2019s going to be ROIC above our cost of capital very quickly in fact within 18 months. And that return perspective is also very powerful if you look at the internal rates of return as another way of thinking about returns.","So the financial characteristics of this deal are very attractive alongside the strategic rationale that we touched on before. Just regarding our financing plan the $965 million purchase price will be paid in all cash. And our intention is to draw a portion of that purchase price from our ABL and the remainder will go into a new underwritten debt issue. We haven\u2019t yet decided exactly how we might approach either, either the amount of the ABL draw, or whether we\u2019ll issue a new debt issue or reopen an existing issue. So more to come as we get a little bit more in-depth and get closer to close on that transaction.","Regarding timing, our expectation is that the deal will close in the early part of the second quarter. And obviously that will be driven by getting through certain key milestones like Hart-Scott-Rodino approval. But we don\u2019t see any issue with HSR it\u2019s just a matter of when the timing will come. So for modelling purpose as we\u2019ve been thinking about it as an April, 1 close obviously if we get to the point of closing earlier, we will do that. But for modelling purposes that\u2019s a reasonable place to start.","So that\u2019s enough of you guys listening to me. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. And hopefully we\u2019ll be able to address any questions that you have, so operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research. Your question please?","Neil Frohnapple","Hi, guys.","William Plummer","Hi, Neil.","Neil Frohnapple","I believe the implied incremental margin on the midpoint to the sales and EBITDA guidance is around 18% for 2017. And I think you mentioned operating expenses higher to support Project XL. But are there any other notable headwinds on 2017 EBITDA such as incentive comp or \u2013 should I not read too much than the calculations since this based on a fairly small revenue change.","William Plummer","Yes, I think it\u2019s an important point that you\u2019ve made right at the end there, it is a small revenue change and so the exact percent that you calculate, you can\u2019t go too far with. But that said, you do have to remember that we do have incremental expenses like normalizing our bonus payout that\u2019s a $27 million impact year-over-year. If we end up paying out 100% in 2017 compared to where we paid out in 2016.","So pretty significant headwind and you certainly need to keep that in mind, of course, on a year-over-year basis we always have our usual suspect like merit increases, merit accounts or something like $23 million to $25 million of headwind year-over-year as well. So you got to keep that in mind. And then we\u2019ve got the usual inflation on the other lines of cost that we will run hard to offset with the savings and the initiatives from Project XL beyond going mean initiatives and so forth. So those are couple of key things that I would throughout Neil.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then what\u2019s your first blush on NES rentals fleet mix composition including class, age et cetera. I mean we will require a period of higher CapEx to improve their fleet mix. And it does look like their more crane exposure to some larger type cranes like rough train. So this is an opportunity longer-term for United to expand more into yours, more or likely that you guys would deemphasize our products over time. Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Thanks, Neil. This is Matt. So the fleet age is a good question and we\u2019re going to find out whether that\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to the point saying that, that\u2019s going to require CapEx. They as a competitor NES is very good customer service and very good customer retention. So we\u2019re going to learn how they have wage that fleet while keeping R&M at a reasonable cost and maybe we\u2019ll learn something there. It is primarily an aerial fleet and we\u2019ve always known if you can [indiscernible] aerial when you need to, but there may be some other trick that\u2019s the great part of all of our acquisitions as we always learn something new from the new team members that we bring on board. As far as the cranes, the cranes is a mix of some cranes that we\u2019re very familiar with like some of the industrial cranes with Broderson Cranes that we use a lot in steel mills and car plant. And they do have some cranes that are not as compatible with our fleet.","They\u2019re isolated in a few markets and with a couple of customers who are very familiar with. I won\u2019t go as for yet is to say we may grow that in our \u2013 in further in our footprint. But we certainly once again have the opportunity to learn. I think it\u2019s important to note that just about all their cranes are bare rentals, which place pretty well for us. So we probably have a little bit of a concern if they were all mean to rentals. So I think it\u2019s an opportunity once again for us to learn about potential new offerings","Neil Frohnapple","Great. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hey George.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good morning. You are targeting costs synergies of about $40 million associated with the NES transaction, a big part of that is coming from operations and operational efficiency, based on your due diligence can you elaborate on the sources of savings, potential savings from operations at NES and also how much potential rental CapEx savings you can generate.","William Plummer","Yes. Hey George, it\u2019s Bill. So what I would say is the operational efficiencies are going to come out of just really diving deeper into their processes as well as our processes and looking for ways to improve those processes based on what either side has learned over time. The way I think about it sort of accrued way, they\u2019re operating at about a 42% EBITDA margin, we\u2019re operating at about 48% EBITDA margin. So that GAAP says that we\u2019re doing something that that they are not. Now whether they can do what we can do or not, we\u2019ll find out more detail, but I think as we look deeper into how they do things and how we do things, we\u2019re going to find ways to close that GAAP somewhat.","And it\u2019s just going to take some time to get to. Regarding other savings, purchasing savings certainly are an opportunity for us I think you saw in the investor deck for the deal that we think that we can find some procurement savings just right off the back just given the greater scale that we have for fleet purchases compared to where we see them. So that\u2019s going to be cash save and we\u2019ll show up immediately release then in operating expenses, but cash save that adds to the value of this deal. So we\u2019ll be looking for other opportunities in addition to the fleet purchases to leverage that aspect as well.","George Tong","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly the year-over-year improvement in time utilization stepped up pretty meaningfully in December, time it was up and 1.7% in December compared to up 28% October and 0.9% in November. The holidays falling on a weekend was a factor, but can you elaborate on how the strength in rental demand changed as you moved through the quarter?","William Plummer","Yes. It really that it \u2013 so you got the profile. I\u2019d say the utilization profile probably mirrors the OEC on rent profile right. So it step-up and you\u2019re right, December was helped by Christmas on a weekend, but that wasn\u2019t the entire story for the month of December. And I\u2019ll let Matt talk about specific areas of demand that we saw, but there was a general move higher as we saw little bit more activity just kind of build as we went through the quarter.","George Tong","Anything you want add?","Matt Flannery","No. I think Bill covered it, but to reiterate the demand was a bigger driver than just the holiday on weekend and that has been encouraging for us. We didn\u2019t have the drop that we haven\u2019t Thanksgiving as large as we\u2019ve had past years that was encouraging for us. So there are a lot of good things for us and I think, you hear that and see that in our guidance going into 2017.","George Tong","Very helpful, thank you.","William Plummer","Thanks, George. I think I told a couple of folks that December was 180 basis points year-over-year as 170 is the right number. Thanks for remind me that George.","George Tong","Of course, thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes in of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please.","Brendon","Hi, this is Brendon on for Seth. Touching on the oil and gas markets, I was wondering if there was any kind of additional color on metrics that you could provide for a performance in the quarter. And then if you are seeing any kind of revamp in activity and if you are aware?","William Plummer","Sure, Brendon. We\u2019ve seen some incremental improvement that would be similar to what you see in the rig count, maybe a little bit less, but I think the important point to know is that this point, the upstream is only a little over 2% of our overall revenue. So if we see a 14%, 15% improvement will \u2013 they\u2019ll have some impact on how much of improvement you are going to see and is it meaningful in the overall organization.","That being said, if you add in the Canadian part of the business, which gets categorized a little bit in the non-drilling in the midstream, that\u2019s another percent of our business brings the total up to three and some improvement up there would really help the team up in Western Canada. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, most of the improvements in the second part of your question has been out in the Permian and mostly in the drills in the U.S., but not so much in Western Canada yet and we are positioned for when we get tail.","Brendon","Okay, great. And then your guidance from the 1.4% to 1.5% growth CapEx, how are you thinking that between \u2013 splitting that between specialty and gen rent and then does the new deal do anything to slow specialty branch openings.","Michael Kneeland","On the latter part of your question absolutely not, we are still targeting 14 cold starts and specialty and actually this new customer base that we are gaining from the NES acquisition, we think and enhance our opportunity to cross sell and I think you saw that in the notes that we had. Additionally, I\u2019m sorry, I think I said 14 \u2013 we had 14 this year and 17 planned for 2017. Additionally, when we think about how we are going to spend the CapEx, specialty is still a top priority.","That seems not only is a very accretive when we grow that business, but they continue to show the ability to grow that business. So that will be a primary source of funding and then Bill touched earlier on the investments we want to make in Project XL and I think that a lot of the rest part CapEx will be to support getting into new verticals, such as continuing to grow our infrastructure business. That might take some unique product, some new product that we think have some great opportunity or the entertainment vertical and while the list could go on, but we do see an opportunity to broaden even our gen rent fleet or non-specialty fleet.","Brendon","Okay thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Steven Ramsey","Hi guys, this is Steven Ramsey on for Nick.","Michael Kneeland","Hi.","Steven Ramsey","Can you talk about NES time utilization and rate trajectory in the past couple of years and how they would compare to you guys?","William Plummer","So I think if you \u2013 we put some revenue NES revenue information in the Investor Day, I don\u2019t remember if we put fleet. I\u2019m just trying to give you some external data that maybe can point you in the right direction. It\u2019s clear that what I\u2019d say on rate is that \u2013 we know that United Rentals is a premium rate company relative to the marketplace. We\u2019ve seen that through a lot of different data sources.","And so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that our rate performance if you measured by dollar utilization for example is higher than NES. I think that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019d go on that front. On time utilization they are a aerial, a heavy fleet and so it\u2019s hard to compare directly their time utilization experience with ours. They\u2019ve done a nice job in getting their fleet on rent and keeping utilizations attractive. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re pleased to see. And we want to make sure that we can support that if not enhance that going forward. So those are the comments that I offer. Matt or Mike, I don\u2019t know, if you guys would want to add anything else.","Matt Flannery","No, I think\u2026","Michael Kneeland","No, I think you covered.","Steven Ramsey","Excellent. And then on the regional color, you provided which was helpful. Is there a much of a discrepancy and this is for core United. Is there a much of a discrepancy in rates by region of the United States?","Matt Flannery","We haven\u2019t gone into that before Steven. I mean there is some discrepancy I would say that the band has tightened over the years. That there\u2019s the big outlier used to be Western Canada. That\u2019s no long, you\u2019ve seen the Canadian rate experience. So that\u2019s tightened up, I think the oil and gas high rate market as we\u2019ve discussed before as part of our headwind. That\u2019s tightening the band overall. And as there is not larger variances there used to be we haven\u2019t discussed in detail but you can imagine the balance of rate and time is what everybody runs in the rental industry. So that is your \u2013 if you\u2019re in severe cold weather markets, you\u2019re going to need to end up in a little bit more rate because your time opportunity is lower, but not anything that I\u2019d call out on the call.","Steven Ramsey","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","William Plummer","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Good morning. Thanks guys.","Michael Kneeland","Hey.","William Plummer","Hey, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Hey, I\u2019m sorry if I missed some of this because we\u2019re just jumping between calls. I mean you say that in upfront but clearly\u2026","Michael Kneeland","Yes, we do hearing\u2026","Ross Gilardi","Yes, think I guess. I think it\u2019s a good time. It\u2019s a hard time to have a conference call. But look clearly you guys are very excited about your business right now, lots of optimism on the future. But I guess when I look at it you\u2019re still guiding the flattish EBITDA at the midpoint. So like are you seeing any genuine acceleration in your business yet or we still kind of at this plateau. I\u2019m trying to understand, what the offsetting factors are here, because you guys saw clearly plenty of growth opportunities that you\u2019re excited about?","William Plummer","I think we can say, we\u2019ve seen genuine acceleration as we talked about in fourth quarter in the overall demand. And if you dig a little deeper into that demand growth, you can point to new projects that have kicked off or that are ramping up. That we expect will continue into 2017. So that gives us encouragement that\u2019s one of the reasons why we put more CapEx into the plan for this year. For example, so on that regard. Yes, we think that there\u2019s genuine acceleration going out there from a demand perspective. How quickly that translates into top line growth and profitability growth is part of the question that we wrestle with at this time in the year.","But we think we captured that wrestling in the ranges that we\u2019ve given in our guidance. So I would say don\u2019t just fixate on the midpoint. Think about the full range that we gave you because we think the full range is reflective of that momentum and how it could play out as we go forward.","Michael Kneeland","And this is Mike. The only thing I would add to that is \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you attended our conference in December, Investor Day. But we laid out a very detailed strategy. And that is what we\u2019re following. We understand the industry. We understand the demand factors as Bill mentioned. You know the easiest thing we can do is add capital. But we have a very, very rigorous plan of how we think about things and how we\u2019re going to execute it.","And that\u2019s where the capital is going to go. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to apply it. We tried to point out the discipline that we\u2019ve put in play are in CapEx last year by increasing the contribution margin, by changing what we\u2019re investing in. And that\u2019s the message I would say as we go forward. Bill is exactly right. We gave a range and that range \u2013 is one that we think is comparison to where the market is and how we see the world.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thanks guys. And then just question on incremental margins going forward. I mean obviously I can see what you\u2019ve laid out there for 2017 and it\u2019s a pretty type range. But how should we think more broadly about incremental. I mean in the good old days when you guys were raising prices like 3%, 4% a year you had this steady incremental EBITDA flow through like 60% plus. I guess and just like more broadly in an environment where demands up a little bit, your growing fleet 4%, 5% in pricings kind of moving sideways. What kind of incremental margin with that sort of translate into on your view?","Michael Kneeland","It makes a little bit more challenging to hit that 60%. I think the wildcard question is how much can some of the Project XL initiatives and sort of the building momentum on our Lean and other cost focus initiatives. How much do those support the flow through that we might otherwise experience. So a hard question, I answer without getting into too many specifics, but what I\u2019d say is if we got to a level of revenue growth that was sort of larger right to get away from the calculation challenge of small levels of revenue growth.","Ross Gilardi","Right.","Michael Kneeland","I\u2019d like to feel that the initiatives that we\u2019ve got going in the business would keep us around that 60% flow through kind of area. So keep asking that question as we go forward and get a little bit more revenue growth going, but if I remodeling flow through I just start there at least and then build some sensitivities around it.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","William Plummer","Yes, thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Pfeffer from Avondale Partners. Your question please.","Larry Pfeffer","Good morning, gentlemen.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, good morning.","William Plummer","Good morning.","Larry Pfeffer","So into your point on, you wish went through on kind of the acceleration is some of the increased CapEx in gen rent going to opportunities that maybe you weren\u2019t able to serve last year.","William Plummer","Yes. I think that\u2019s fair, right. I think we climb down pretty hard on CapEx in 2016. And there were certainly numerous cases. I know because every time I went out in the field people accosted me about capital. Numerous cases we\u2019re focused on that, it would be a good idea to invest more capital to go after some of the business that we just couldn\u2019t when we were constraining capital. So if you read that constrain a little bit then you can get that business and you can support the initiatives under Project XL and some of the verticals that we\u2019re going after as Matt mentioned. And so that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish with a little bit more capital in 2017.","Larry Pfeffer","Got you. And then just on the acquisition front obviously large deal here with NES. How does that change your thinking if it all on kind of the pipeline as we move through 2017?","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike. We always have a pipeline. I think that as Bill went through his opening comments, he talked about how our trend \u2013 in the transaction, how we think about our M&A strategy. First start strategically, I mean look at the financial aspects, and then cultural is also another one. It\u2019s very important to learn. This one here happens ahead all of them. And there are numerous deals that we have looked at and we just continue on, they will make the card. And that\u2019s how we \u2013 that\u2019s the discipline in rigor that we put in play. We have a pretty high bar and that\u2019s not going to change. So if they hit all three of those buckets then we are very interested, but much beyond that we have the disciplined at to walk from.","William Plummer","And the capacity if we do find one that lines up right, this deal will only take us to little under three times leverage right at the close, by the end of the year that leverage is going to come down, depending on what we end up doing with the share repurchase for example to nicely below three times. So we\u2019ll be in a position where of another deal lines up and it\u2019s available later this year. We\u2019re ready to go.","Larry Pfeffer","Got you. Thanks for taking my questions guys.","Michael Kneeland","Yes.","William Plummer","Right. Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.","Joe Box","Hey guys.","Michael Kneeland","Hey Joe.","William Plummer","Hey Joe.","Joe Box","So Mike over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve talked about steering the company toward higher returning items like specialty. I know you\u2019ve left the door open for really any deal, but maybe if you could just highlight the top one or two things that really made you comfortable with going with a big gen rent deal.","Michael Kneeland","Well. Joe I think I just outlined transaction with NES I think is a way of looking at it strategically. And as you think about it, when I will just check \u2013 go through the check list. It accesses to new customers. It supports growth in attractive markets. And enhances that cross selling that specialty side of the business. And we give market density. From our financial, as Bill outlined, we get growth returns free cash flow without significantly impacting our leverage to getting a cost synergies.","And then the cultural aspect of when [indiscernible] going back strategically as Matt mentioned, and here\u2019s a company that as older assets, but their churncustomer was relatively low, which is peaks volume about how they focus on the customer. That along with safety is something that both of those items are a part of the United Rentals\u2019 culture.","So those are things that we look at and those are the things, how we would look at all every one of these. From a timing perspective, you talk about large one. We have to look at leverage. And those are all the components that now we look at and again I can only tell you that we have the courage not to new deals.","Matt Flannery","Yes, just from the finance section of this room the tax benefit is no small thing as well. That\u2019s very important value for us as we move into being a pull cash tax payer to be able to realize that $125 million present value, with a pretty high certainty is pretty attractive. So just one more piece of that puzzle that Mike just step through the said a lot of things lined up to make this deal attractive.","Joe Box","Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe switching gears, can you guys just give us a feel for maybe how the OEC on rent or the rental rate trajectory seems to be looking into January? I guess I just want to be cognizant of the favorable weather that we saw in 4Q and the timing in the holiday relative to what seems like could be a ramp in overall activity.","William Plummer","Yes, Joe. So to be consistent with our approach have not giving guidance or going into too much debt about rate and time utilization, I won\u2019t answer that question directly, all update is that we\u2019ve giving you the guidance for the full year, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would cause us to change that guidance, obviously, because we just gave the last night. So that as far as would ready to go and comment about January.","Joe Box","Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.","William Plummer","Thank Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jerry Revich. I know that you won\u2019t comment on pricing and better than in your guidance. But can you way on in your view that is broader pricing cycle, we\u2019ve had a positive about past years. But with your CapEx announcement should that be an indication that you expect for market to return to pricing growths.","William Plummer","I won\u2019t directly address pricing other than to say that I do believe \u2013 we do believe that there is a very good argument that the overall cycle is in good shape. And will continue on and upward path for some time to come, whether that manifest itself in rates going back up and sort of the 4%, 5%, 6% a year kind of frame that they did. Earlier in this recovery I leave it to you to put your own estimate on that. But the cycle has legs to go is our view. And so that will support demand and depending on, how the market dynamics respond to that demand, it will have an impact on where rates go.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, and then as you evaluate the NES business model. Can you talk about what you see as the drivers for there, lower dollar utilization and EBITDA to OEC. And then like how much of that GAAP is operational verse requiring equipment refresh to read this might spending?","Matt Flannery","So I would this is Matt, I would say that it\u2019s probably when you compare it to our overall dollar utilization. The first of significant driver is the fleet next. So they are primarily an aerial company at doesn\u2019t bring even for us as high dollar utilization as our average, but also doesn\u2019t bring the cost associated with it. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us that help bolster their dollar utilization through our processes and by serving additional products to their customers. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we think we\u2019re a good owner for that business.","As far as their fleet age, I don\u2019t think that really plays too much into the dollar utilization it may add some incremental cost. But we feel when we put these two companies together in some of these markets we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to get a better net return than we get today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And one more if I can. On RSC you reduced cost by 16% of the acquired company sales. Here you\u2019re implying that 11% of EMEA sales, what\u2019s driving that difference and is that maybe something just being a little conservative.","Matt Flannery","Other than the fact that we\u2019re buying both companies they don\u2019t have that many similarities. RSC was a public company had a lot more overhead costs that we could \u2013 that we\u2019re duplicative immediately. So that was a big driver. At the time of the RSC acquisition a lot of the savings were driven by branch closures, because we both had extra capacity in existing facilities. As a result to the RSC facility \u2013 acquisition, we don\u2019t have a lot of excess capacity in our facilities right now. So store consolidation is not the opportunity it was. We actually see the footprint and the employees and the talent in this acquisition as a potential growth platform. So this is not strictly a cost play here and those would be the significant drivers to why that number is different.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","William Plummer","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning guys and congratulation.","William Plummer","Hey, thank you.","Scott Schneeberger","In Canada, let\u2019s speak there, its sounds like you had really nice rental revenue growth in the U.S. with Canada dragging and if you could just touch on that. And then going a little deeper, what\u2019s underlying in the guidance for Canada for the upcoming year. It seems like you are optimistic in the industrial area in Canada and the U.S. So if you could just elaborate there please? Thanks.","Matt Flannery","Sure. I would say that overall, we\u2019re looking at Canada to be flat to slightly up and that varies greatly by provinces, even our experience in Q4. Six of the 10 provinces did have growth \u2013 did have volume growth and there are some robust markets that are doing well. It\u2019s all dragged down by the big rock in Alberta for us with such great penetration and market share in Alberta and that\u2019s where the country has taken its biggest hit. So it\u2019s a little bit of a balancing act. I will say that we\u2019re positioned well enough in all 10 provinces that whatever opportunity it comes.","We can exceed what we have planned right now and some of that growth capital could shift up there, should they get any tailwind like what you\u2019re referring to is almost 5% industrial growth forecasted. Those forecast always exchange throughout the year, but if it holds true I would imagine that we\u2019d end up putting some of that growth capital into Canada. We\u2019re also continuing some cold start growth in our specialty business in Canada, so there\u2019s more penetration there as an opportunity. So I would say flat is maybe the implied guide, but if that shifts in the opportunity shifts will accordingly shift fleet up there.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks Matt. Bill just a quick follow-up on the CapEx. You address the buckets before, thanks for that and if you want to go maybe to re-magnitude those that will be appreciated. But this question is really more about cadence and what type of pattern we should see through the year as we enter. Thanks.","William Plummer","Thanks, Scott. I won\u2019t go any further on the buckets but regards cadence, you recall the last year, we clamp down pretty hard in the first quarter. So we won\u2019t be that aggressive in the first quarter relative to the rest of the year. This year, if I remember the number from last year was about $100 million in Q1 with the overall increase and with a little bit of a shift in timing. You could see a spin in the neighbourhood of twice that in Q1 this year.","The second and third quarters will be up dollar wise. But not dramatically so maybe a little bit more of an increase in the third quarter than the second. And then the fourth quarter will be up just a little bit over fourth quarter of 2016. So that some broad guidelines for you to get started and if that doesn\u2019t help ask again in April on the next call.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, great. Thanks guys.","William Plummer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session in today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for closing comments.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thank you. In closing, I want to remind everyone that there\u2019s a new Investor Presentation on our website. That contains more details about the acquisition, if you haven\u2019t seen it already. You will also find seven decks and a webcast from our Investor Day, including more about Project XL. So there\u2019s a lot going on. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next 90 days. In the meantime feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, who is in-charge of our IR. And if you have any questions, follow-up and\/or would like to see a facility. We welcome that. So thank you very much and look forward to our next quarterly call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"21064":["United Rentals (NYSE:URI) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 17, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Michael J.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is indicated in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release.","For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year-end December 31, 2012, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.ur.com.","Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations. You should also note that the company's earnings release, investor presentation and today's call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.","Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome. As the operator said, with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior management team.","I'll start off with some of the numbers you saw last night, and then I'll talk about our operating environment, including the status of the recovery. And then after that, Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail, and then we'll go over to Q&A.","Our first quarter results made a strong statement about commitment to profitable growth. In our slowest seasonal quarter, we generated $451 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 41% margin. That's 420 basis points higher than last year, and it's also a first quarter record for us. And we intend to deliver over $2.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA on approximately $5 billion of revenue this year. And we hit our mark with total revenue in the quarter despite a harsh winter in the Northeast and Central U.S.","Three key metrics met or exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Our rates, time utilization and used equipment margin were all up year-over-year. Now the combination of these metrics tells us that our customers are truly in a recovery, and our CORE business overall is very strong. An important part of our strategy is to submit our relationships with key accounts, and we did exactly that in the quarter, with our key account rental revenue up more than 11% year-over-year.","Now on the cost side, we continue to make progress with synergies from the merger. And as you saw last night, we realized another $53 million of cost savings in the quarter, and our target of $230 million to $250 million remains realistic as a fully developed run rate.","Now before I continue, I should remind everyone that our year-over-year comparisons are still on a pro forma basis. That is we're measuring the quarter against the combined results of RSC and United Rentals in the first quarter of 2012. And we closed the RSC transaction at the end April last year, so we have one more quarter of pro forma comparisons to go.","So let's turn to the external environment. I'm pleased to say that we feel just as bullish about the recovery as we did in our last call. The national indicators for construction and industrial are still positive. And more important, they're trending upward. In fact, I was in Dallas a few weeks ago to meet with our regional leaders, and it was brought up several times about the environment. Their confidence level is high, and there's far less uncertainty than a year ago.","In early 2012, we were still debating whether the recovery was real. Now it's more a question of pace. And there's also a layer of secular penetration that I've spoken about in the past. Much of the penetration is coming from customers who are very savvy about fleet and are now renting some of the fleet they used to own, so they know about the equipment applications. Now these customers are very focused on reducing costs and improving and increasing their productivity, and our value proposition provides that.","Currently, we have $7.2 billion of rental fleet based on original equipment cost, and that includes $166 million of net rental CapEx we spent through March. Last year, if you recall, we front-loaded our fleet and spent about 36% of our annual CapEx in the first quarter. We did that to take advantage of an attractive Tier 3 pricing that was available to us. Now this year, we spent about 19% of our CapEx in the first quarter, which reflects a return to more normalized levels. And we plan to spend over $600 million on fleet in the second quarter, which will put us about 50% of CapEx deployed by the end of June. And we could spend more in the quarter if we feel that it's warranted. But in any case, we expect our full year gross investment in fleet to be close to our outlook, which is about $1.5 billion.","Now as we add fleet, we're also taking the necessary steps to get that fleet into the hands of our customers, and I'm talking about sales presence. Now last year, when we merged the 2 companies, we went to a complete review of our sales training, compensation, territory structure and sales management. And it's a big part of our integration. And we got everybody on the same page. Now we have a cohesive sales environment, and we're going to add more feet on the street as part of our plan. We currently have about 1,200 outside sales reps in the field, and we expect to increase that number by at least 10% over the next 12 months.","Our salespeople are the frontline of our strategy. Their primary job is to develop relationships with our customers. Which is the bedrock of our growth, and has our full attention. They're also an important part of our plan to reduce volatility in our business mix.","This year, we see an additional opportunity to revitalize a group, what we call unassigned accounts. Unassigned accounts are typically local commercial contractors, and they currently represent about 38% of our base. Our revenue on the unassigned accounts grew in the first quarter year-over-year, but it could have been more robust. Now there are still some lingering effects of the integration and the branch consolidation, but our reps are increasing their touches with unassigned accounts to tap more strongly into this space.","So as you can see, there's a lot going on, and our branch teams are energized by the activities that surrounds them. Our employees know that we're selling the best value proposition in the industry, leading with safety first. We've given them the tools and technology to hone in on market opportunities and capture share.","Every one of our regions is driving hard to be a top performer this year. Now to give you a snapshot of our regions in the first quarter, 10 of our 14 regions had year-over-year growth in rental revenue, and the headwinds from the remaining 4 regions were mostly related to weather. And if you recall, we almost had no winter last year, so some of the projects got off to a slower start this year. But it doesn't qualify as a market trend. Western Canada, on the other hand, was booming, up more than 19% due to the energy sector. And our specialty rentals segment generated increase of more than 28% year-over-year. Now within specialty, power HVAC was up more than 41%, including same-store increase of 31%. And we plan to continue to expand our specialty footprint this year and cross-sell these services even more vigorously with our customers.","Matt will be here on the call, and he'll be available during Q&A to answer any questions you may have about our field operations and the integration.","So in summary, there are many positive undercurrents for our company, both internally and externally. And we're going to grow our business at every level, from our top line to our shareholder value. And that growth is going to be robust. In fact, we think it will outpace the market, which is a forecast to increase about 6% this year, with close to 10% growth in 2014.","Now I want to emphasize that we're being very targeted about opportunities in this environment. We know that some transactions will be more profitable than others as we enter -- as our end markets begin to recover, and we will not be chasing every deal. We're not interested in escalating our revenues if it hurts our margins in the process. We want to serve our customers, and we want to do it in a way that drives exceptional returns. And then we want to retain those profitable customers and expand our base. That's what our strategy is designed to do. And clearly, we're succeeding.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.","William B. Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll provide a little bit more detail on the quarter. But maybe I'll do it a little differently this quarter than in many quarters past. We've gotten some very specific questions in reaction to our release last night, and I thought I'd take the time to walk through a couple of items that I think will help people understand the quarter better and help flesh out the discussions. Along the way, I'll try to throw in some of the key performance measures for the quarter. But if I miss anything, please do raise it in Q&A.","And I think it'd be useful to structure the discussion around a bridge of EBITDA from last year to this year. Last year, we delivered $392 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and that goes to the $451 million that we delivered in the first quarter of this year. And again, everything in this discussion, except where I might note it, will be a pro forma discussion.","So how did we go from $392 million to $451 million? We told you about our synergy results in the quarter. We realized $53 million of synergies in the quarter, so that has a direct add-on to last year's adjusted EBITDA. If you dive a little deeper into our revenue performance in the quarter, we told you that we delivered 5.4% rental rate increases year-over-year. That 5.4%, if you apply it to the prior year's owned equipment rental revenue and you have the use OER rather than the total rental revenue in order to get the right measure, right, the rental rate only applies to the owned equipment revenue. It doesn't apply to re-rent. It doesn't apply to the ancillary items within rental revenue. And that's one of the reasons why we call those pieces out in our press release this year because it's a significant item in the quarter.","So if you applied 5.4% rental rate to last year's OER, which was about 86% of last year's total rental revenue, you get about $40 million of rate impact on a year-over-year basis. And since that's rate, it's almost 100% flow-through. So call it $40 million of increased EBITDA from rental rate alone.","On volume, we called volume OEC-on-Rent growth year-over-year at 5.8% in the quarter. That's what we realized this year. So if you used that 5.8% and apply it to the prior year OER, you get a volume impact at revenue, which you then need to reduce the EBITDA by using a flow-through. We used about 70% flow-through on the volume impact. And if you use 5.8% volume, 70% flow-through, you get an EBITDA impact from volume of about $30 million. So that's an add-on to last year. We also had a better used equipment sale gross profit result this year of about $5 million better than last year, so that's an add-on. So those are all the add-ons that take you from last year to this year, and that increases last year's EBITDA by $128 million.","So let me walk now through the deductions that get you down to the $451 million that we reported this year. Within the quarter this year compared to last year, we had one less working day in 2012 -- excuse me, in the 2013 quarter. And one of the working days that we had in 2013 was Good Friday. Good Friday and Easter fell into the second quarter last year. They were in the first quarter this year. So when you look at that impact, our revenue per working day is in the area of $10 million per working day, and the flow-through on those working days is pretty high. So the net effect of having one less working day, plus one of the working days being a semi-holiday, was about $12 million at EBITDA in the year-over-year comparison. So there's a $12 million deduct.","The other lines of business, including our contractor supplies business and our service and other line, was down year-over-year in the quarter. That reflected the strategy we've been focusing more on rental and, therefore, allowing the revenue items to find their own level while increasing the margins in those lines of business. But it also reflected the fact that we sold wind [ph] systems during the course of last year, and the year-over-year impact there was a decline in the gross profit.","So when you look at those other lines of business, and I lump in along with those other lines of business, the year-over-year change in non-rental equipment sales, the sales of delivery trucks, trailers, things like that, those all add up to a deduct of somewhere in the $10 million to -- roughly, $10 million area, let's call it.","Period mix. You've heard us talk about this a lot. Our mix on a day, week and month basis has been shifting toward monthly. That's been pretty consistent over the last several years. In the first quarter, our period mix shifted to 77.1% monthly. That's 170 basis points greater monthly share this year compared to last year. We have a methodology internally that we use to estimate that period mix impact, and that gives us about a $10 million EBITDA impact year-over-year in the first quarter. So there's a $10 million deduct there.","And then I mentioned previously ancillary revenues and re-rent revenues. Those are part of our rental revenue, our total rental revenues. They were down year-over-year. Both were, we believe, responding to our strategy with re-rents, in particular. Since the merger, we've been very focused on displacing re-rented items with items that are in our own portfolio, and you saw the impact there. Our re-rent in the quarter was down about $22.6 million -- excuse me, 22.6% compared to last year, the dollar amounts appreciably smaller. But that represents a drag as does the ancillary items, items like pickup and delivery charges, our loss damage waiver program and so on. Those were down a combined 2.3% in the quarter. So when you look at the EBITDA impact of those revenue declines, we get about a $5 million deduct for ancillary and re-rent. So those are sort of the normal routine things that represent a deduct in the year-over-year EBITDA.","In addition, there were several items that we would categorize as one-timers in the quarter. So for example, we were implementing a focus on reducing our OEC not available across the business in the first quarter. We had some success there. We were able to reduce that OEC not available to the lowest level that we've seen in a couple of years at one point during the quarter. We will continue that focus. But as you do it, it incurs incremental expense in labor, parts purchases and other supplies associated with getting the equipment up and ready for the busy season. That incremental effort cost us, we estimate, about $5 million in the quarter. Again, it's a one-timer. It'll certainly be -- there'll certainly be some over effect of that effort in the second quarter, but it will be reduced versus what we experienced in the first quarter.","During the quarter, we also were very heavily investing in implementing a lean management technique called 5S, many of you have heard us talk about it, across our branches. That effort requires us to rearrange our maintenance shops and do things like repainting the floors, repainting lines, adding new signage, adding new tools and racking and so on. We estimate that, that effort in the first quarter cost us an incremental $5 million as well in overall costs.","And then finally, we had what is a more normal effect but one that we felt we should call out, the impact of our merit increases on a year-over-year basis, which was again about $5 million. 5s are wild here today. But those 3 impacts we wanted to call out because they represent significant incremental costs in the first quarter. If you deduct those 5 by 3, you get another $15 reduction -- $15 million reduction, and that leaves about $15 million of the year-over-year EBITDA change unexplained. We attribute that remaining $15 million or so to weather and other unexplainable items.","On the weather front, you've heard us talk about it. We had a real winter this year, and that compares to last year, where winter was very mild across most of the continent. That weather impact hits us both in the top line, reduces your productivity and your ability to get the fleet ready and out on rent, reduces the demand from projects that are slow. But it also hits you on the cost lines as it costs you more to just prepare your equipment for delivery. And so we estimate that impact, along with -- and there are host of other puts and takes that are all aggregate as being somewhere around $15 million or so.","So that gets you from last year's EBITDA to the $451 million that we reported this year. Hopefully, that's helpful and addresses questions that we've had. But if not, then please do ask further questions during Q&A.","One other discussion that we have with folks following the report last night revolved around our flow-through in the quarter. Flow-through in total for the quarter was $164 million -- excuse me, 164% when you include the impact of the synergies. But when you exclude the synergies, it drops appreciably. And the question was your flow-through x synergies in prior quarters have been much higher. You told us that you're going to get to the 60% to 70% range flow-through x synergies for the full year. What's going on? How are you going to get there? Well, I called out of those specific items in the quarter, the 3 $5 million hits for a 5S, OEC not available and our merit increases. Those were direct drags to our flow-through when you exclude the impact of the synergies this year. So when you add that $15 million -- you add back that $15 million drag to the year-over-year revenue change x synergies, you get a flow-through that's right at 58%. And for the first quarter, 58% x synergies is in the zone where we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to deliver the flow-through x synergies for the full year in that normal range of 60% to 70%. So hopefully, that addresses that question that some of you may have had about our flow-through performance in the quarter.","Before I wrap-up, I just want to spend a couple of minutes updating our outlook. It'll be very quick because we haven't changed any component of our outlook. We still expect the full year rental rate increase to come in at 4.5%, and we still are very focused on delivering the time utilization and revenue and EBITDA guidance that we gave earlier in the year. So revenue will be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, and time utilization within rental revenue will be about 68% for the full year. That's up 50 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year will be between $2.250 billion and $2.350 billion. And we continue to expect, as Mike said, to spend $1.5 billion gross rental CapEx, which will net down to about $1,050,000,000 after the impact of used sales proceeds.","Finally, free cash flow will continue to be robust. We had a good free cash result in the first quarter, $234 million, and it puts us well on the path to deliver the $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow that we expect for the full year this year. And I might emphasize it continues us on the path to deliver the kind of free cash flow over the next several years that we've talked about, most specifically back in our Investor Day in December. Over the next few years, we expect to deliver almost $2 billion of free cash flow, and we feel that, that will be a very, very robust cash flow environment for the company even while we're continuing to grow the fleet, continuing to grow top line and continuing to deliver the kind of profitability and margin and return that we're targeting to deliver.","So with that, I'll end my comments and ask the operator to open the call up for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","How should we think about the mix and the ancillary revenue headwinds going forward? Should that start to abate? Or is that going to continue to be negative $10 million, $15 million a quarter going forward?","William B. Plummer","Seth, I guess, maybe what I can usefully say is a comment about the full year rather than the quarter-by-quarter. I think you remember we said back in January, that we expected the full year mix impact to be something like 1.5% on the full year. I think it's fair to say now that the mix will be a little bit more than that, more of a headwind than that during the course of the year. It'll be less than it was last year. I think it was 5.1% last year so somewhere between 5.1% and 1.5% is where we'll end up over the course of the year. And I'll leave it to your own imagination as to how you parse that out across the quarters. But that's the overall mix, by the way. That's including all of the effects. The $10 million that I gave here was just the day, week and month component of mix. And you got to make sure that you make that distinction. But overall, we think it'll be something a little bit more negative than 1.5% but less negative than 5.1%.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then with the pull forward of the CapEx in the second quarter, the $600 million, how should we think about -- I assume free cash flow would be negative in the quarter. What -- can you frame the order of magnitude we should be thinking about for free cash flow use in the second quarter?","William B. Plummer","I'd rather not. We get that granular on the timing of free cash flow through the quarter. The $600 million, if we deliver that and if you assume that we have a payables, payable terms with our vendors, that they're somewhere in the 60-day area, that can give you a rough idea of the impact that we will see in the second quarter. So I'll stop there, Seth.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Could I ask -- slide another one in then? It sounds like you're suggesting that there could be some specialty -- you're talking about expanding your specialty footprint. I mean, is that going to be organic or do you think that'll be acquisition? And is that -- does your guidance include some acquisitions for this year in the specialty rental business?","Michael J. Kneeland","This is Mike. And that is -- it's organic. What we've got in there is baked into our plan. We are going to be opening up some locations in all 3 segments: Trench, Power, HVAC; and also in our tools, which is all organic. We haven't baked in any assumptions for acquisitions at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","With regard to the additional sales force, could you take us a level deeper there? You mentioned unassigned accounts. Is it -- is that predominantly where it's going to be? Is there going to be some in national strategic as well and just kind of the productivity curve you expect from these salespeople being added?","Matthew J. Flannery","So this is Matt, Scott. Primarily, this will be local reps. We feel very comfortable with the output from our strategic account managers and that part of our sales team. We just want to -- and this has been built into our plan. We just want to pivot from the integration period where we were stabilizing and really focused on harmonizing contracts and all the things that went with our sales efforts last year and pivot to growth mode. There's a portion of these sales reps that's more R&D. But as we continue to grow in 2014 and beyond, we think it's appropriate to add to our sales force to help facilitate that growth.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then one more, if I could. On the 10 of the 14 regions that were positive, could you -- I guess, specifically on the 4 that were not in the quarter, were those Northern regions? Could you kind of address where the weakness was and what you expect from those regions and overall progression over the year?","Matthew J. Flannery","Yes, I don't want to point to a specific region. But I will say, we all know where the weather-related markets are in the Northeastern half of the continent, in the Midwest as well. So that's where our issues were. To be clear, none of the -- some of them were only down by less than half a point. But nonetheless, for transparency, they were negative. We don't expect any of those regions to not show positive year-over-year growth by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So Bill, I understand why you're adding back the 3 $5 million headwinds to kind of get you to that 58% flow-through x synergy. But why wouldn't you add back the $12 million EBITDA headwind from workdays since that should theoretically reverse in 2Q?","William B. Plummer","The workday impact is in revenue as well, and so we just think it's a more fair representation the way that I described it.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. But we should see that somewhat reverse then in 2Q though, right?","William B. Plummer","You should. 2Q workdays are flat year-over-year, so I don't expect that there'll be much of an impact from working days certainly in the second quarter.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect.","William B. Plummer","We don't recall what the full year comparison of workdays is. You can count your calendar as well as I can.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to follow-up on Seth's specialty question, can you guys give us a sense of what the breakout would be by volume of equipment on rent versus pricing so we can essentially see the difference between specialty and the general rents business?","William B. Plummer","So -- go ahead, Mike.","Michael J. Kneeland","Go ahead, Bill.","William B. Plummer","No, I was just going to ask for clarification. You're asking for a breakout by specialty versus gen rent of volume rate?","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct. Yes, exactly.","William B. Plummer","Yes, that's not something that we've done historically, Joe, so let's not break new precedents right now. We'll give some thought about whether we should say more about that as the specialty business grows in scale.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's fair. Maybe let me ask it this way then. Can you give us a sense of how much of the growth that you're seeing within specialty as a function of you pulling out the re-rent from RSC?","William B. Plummer","It's a nontrivial contributor to growth. But we are also very, very keenly focused on growing just in and of itself. So we've had close starts that we've opened that really weren't driven by displacing re-rents. We have had investment in the fleet that's above and beyond what was needed to displace re-rents in a very significant way. So I don't know what the percentage mix would be, but I would say most of the growth is coming from our focus on driving the business more so than displacing re-rents.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yes, Joe, this is Mike. I would say that's exactly right. I mean, we went to the harmonization of contracts. And keep in mind, with RSC, it wasn't something they promoted because they didn't have it. We do. We're cross-selling it, and we are pursuing it across a broader footprint. For an example, like the tools that they -- that RSC had, we're now replicating that across our broad footprint, and we've seen significant growth. And we're going to continue to support that growth as we go forward. So to me, it was the best of both worlds and where we can capture a lot of the synergies down the road. And again, it's profitable and it's part of our strategy to help untangle our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So the first thing I was hoping to circle back on was the commentary around the key accounts and the unsigned accounts, and you've consistently laid out on in the slide deck kind of what those numbers look like on a relative basis. The unassigned accounts certainly have been growing at a substantially slower than the key accounts. And I think we all understand that the focus has been on more profitable business, higher skew towards industrial. But I think we've also seen kind of across the competitive landscape relative growth rates among all the competitors. Do you think part of the reason -- do you think that the unsigned accounts are on an underlying basis growing at a faster rate than the key accounts?","Michael J. Kneeland","I would say that is growing. Certainly, it's growing on a year-over-year basis. As you know that the residential market is starting to heal. That's going to add to the to that mix and something we don't participate in. But inside of that, what we're trying to articulate is that the localized customers takes a lot more touches. And we -- and it's feeder based. There are very attractive customers inside of that group that we'd like to hold on to. And as we went through the integration, we wanted to make sure that we stabilized and captured our most profitable customers and get everyone on the same page. And as Matt stated earlier, we're now pivoting and going after what we believe inside of that group is profitable. And typically, small-end projects are going to ramp up quicker, and you're going to see higher results sooner. It takes a while to plan for a convention center or a sports stadium or a hotel or a power plant. It doesn't happen overnight. Whereas if you want to do spot remodeling or do some landscaping, that's real time and doesn't take a lot of effort to get that up and running. So some of it may be phased in over time. But we think our end market, given what we're seeing in the ABI Index, is going to provide very nice growth in the future.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I just wanted to get a little more clarity on, on the synergy side of things, could you walk through what portion would be attributable to cost of rent, what might be other aspects of COGS that are non-rental related and what was SG&A?","William B. Plummer","Sure thing, Ted. If you take the $53 million, $24 million of that was cost of rent saves and the remainder $29 million was SG&A saves.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It was. And so I guess what I'm trying to square up is, if I were to say the underlying SG&A rate was, I think, 160 reported, plus 29. You get to 189. Can you just bridge this year-on-year, where those incremental costs came from on a pro forma basis?","William B. Plummer","So, Ted, I don't have the detail and you don't have the patience for me to go through every department line. But we do break down our synergies by functional department at corporate and by the SG&A roles in the field. And it's really too much detail to go through. And quite honestly, I don't know that it adds a lot of value for discussion. If there are specific areas that you're interested in, I guess we can talk about them broadly. But we don't have a sort of a useful digestible summary to talk about right here and now.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. I can take it offline.","William B. Plummer","Yes, that's probably best.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Manish Somaiya from Citi. A couple of questions. One is on market share. We have had a couple of regional issuers come to the high-yield market, and they've all kind of said that they've gained customers from your transition. And I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts, was this clever pruning on your part or is there something more?","Michael J. Kneeland","Well, I think that there was some pruning on our part. Clearly, as we went through and consolidated our locations, there was a component of walk-in business that we knew we weren't going to retain. So that's something that we willing to sacrifice as we went forward. As you know, part of our strategy is that longer-term customer to benefit from our broad footprint and more of the regional and national account. 11.5% growth in the key account, I would tell you we think that we're outperforming the market. So could they in certain markets? Yes, absolutely. At the results of our closures, that could be had. There again, on rental rates, we want to make sure that we're getting the right return for our business. And that's an area that -- everyone's raising their rates. But we believe our rates, according to the Rouse data, is primarily one of the highest, if not the highest, according to their market survey. So in those areas, yes, you're going to expect some leakage.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then just clearly, I mean, the transaction with RSC was a game changer. We're seeing all the synergies flow-through. But can you just help us understand the synergies that someone like a URI would have acquiring a small regional player?","Michael J. Kneeland","Again, I go back to my fundamentals of why you would do an acquisition. One would be, strategically, does it make sense? So strategically, is it in a market we don't serve? Is it a product we don't serve? Do they have a heavier component and, say, earthmoving than we don't have today? Is it something more industrial? Is it more related to the power HVAC tools or the trench business, so that we can broaden our footprint quicker and get a higher return? That would be one. So strategically, that -- it has to fit that bucket. The other bucket would be is, economically, does it make sense? Is there enough synergies? Can we buy it in a point where it makes sense to our shareholders? And then the last one is going to be culture. There are companies that answer the first 2 but the cultures are so different. It's very hard to blend cultures that are miles apart, and it's fraught with risk. So we tend to look at all 3 of those as we think about acquisitions.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just finally, clearly, there's some long runway on the domestic front for you. How do you think about potentially analyzing entering certain international markets?","Michael J. Kneeland","I always get that question, and I answer it by saying that North America's still the largest market. We're still in the teens when it comes to market share. We still have ways to go to fully integrate the acquisition. And as I mentioned, there are segments like the power HVAC tools and trench that we can integrate with our current customer portfolio. That being said, we do have customers who have been knocking on our door, asking us to go because of our value proposition. When we think that we've exhausted our opportunities here and our customers, the valuation to our customers is so great. I think that we'll have to look at it. But right here and now, North America's still the largest opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Have you seen any disparity in rental revenue performance between industrial and construction end markets in the quarter?","Michael J. Kneeland","Well, Matt can talk specifically. But typically, the industrial is a -- has -- there's 2 ways of looking at it. There's shutdowns, which are planned, and then there's new construction. We do know there's a lot of new construction that is planned. We're seeing an insurgence of chemical companies. We're seeing automotive expansion not only in the big 3, but also in foreign investment. We're seeing expansion in other areas. It takes time to get them up and running. It's good -- we're happy to say that the book of business that we see is relatively strong in that segment, but there is a phase-in effect. The way I look at it is you see residential grow. You're going to see smaller construction grow. And then you start seeing commercial, which requires engineering and drawings and a process for bidding, grow. And then you see the industrial grow as well.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, question on the cost side. I guess, one more focus on reducing OEC not available this year than in the past. And then, I guess, the second part of that, what kind of benefits do you expect to see from the greater focus?","Michael J. Kneeland","Well, I will tell you that one of the things that we learn in the best-in-class with RSC was they were very good at not available for rent. They did a system called Spin. We have workbench. We're a combination of 2. We're rolling that out. What does it benefit or how does it benefit us with $7.2 billion of fleet? If we can take that down and get 2 points of fleet that's available for rent and put it out on rent, that's a sizable amount of cash. And so it helps our returns. And so again, it's part of that best-in-class practice that we learned. We're implementing it, and we're rolling it out throughout the organization.","Matthew J. Flannery","Yes, I agree with Mike. It also gives us an opportunity to maybe push limits of our peak time utilization during peak periods. Because if we're able to turn fleet quicker, we can say yes to more customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on mix. Could you give us additional details on what specific items will help reduce the negative mix impact on rental revenues in 2013 versus 2012?","William B. Plummer","So we touched a little bit on re-rent and ancillary, and the year-over-year comparisons in re-rent and ancillary could be a little bit of a help as we go through the year. Re-rent, right, once we close the deal in the early part of the second quarter last year is when we started that effort to displace re-rents. And so that effect was starting to play out in the second, third, fourth quarter last year. And so when compared to that, this year, it may not be as much of a drag as it was in the first quarter. I think as we come into the seasonally more active time of the year, the impact of some of the day, week and month mix or the shift to monthly on a year-over-year basis might go down as you have a little bit more of the seasonal work that starts to pop up. So that could be a positive. What else? Anything else, Matt, that you can think of that we can throw out there?","Matthew J. Flannery","No, I think you covered it.","William B. Plummer","Yes. So I mean, I think it's items like that we look at and we say, \"Okay, a lot of headwind in the first quarter.\" But as we see the quarters play out, that will reduce as we go through the year.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And as you're adding to the sales force, how should we think about the impact to margin growth?","Matthew J. Flannery","So as far as from a cost prospective, that employee base is 80%, plus variable, so -- and we have it built into our plan. I think we had 130 additional reps built into our plan, and we may peak out at 150. So that variance of 20 reps is not going to be material. And as far as revenue, we're really expecting to hope to see that in the back half the year and more importantly, in 2014 and beyond. Part of adding these new reps is an R&D project. We went to home-grow a lot of these reps. And we think that by bringing in new talent not just to the company, but to the industry, we could really get some long-term positive effects from that.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, could tell us what your progress is in achieving revenue synergies this year and where the opportunity is coming from?","Michael J. Kneeland","So George, we haven't published a number. But as we think about the revenue synergies drivers, we've made some good progress in areas like displacing re-rents. That's been an important revenue synergy driver, and we do track it. We've made some important progress in the harmonization of contracts between the legacy RSC contracts and the legacy United Rentals, where that work is essentially done. A few lingering contracts are out there yet to be finalized but essentially done. And we can track the changes in rate and other terms from the old contracts to the new and identify revenue synergies from those changes. And there are several others that we track. The challenge we have in putting a number out there is that the revenue dis-synergies that occur are hard to quantify. Really hard to say what did I lose as a result of the integration of our 2 companies. So one concrete example is we closed a lot of branches as part of the consolidation work. Exactly how much walk-in business did I lose that hasn't come back yet? That's very hard to put a number on. And so we're spending a lot of time thinking about how we should think about that dis-synergy offset to the revenue synergies that are reasonably straightforward to calculate before we start talking about a concrete number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wondering, just broadly, I mean, do you think there's a lot of pent-up demand in the second quarter based on the weather impact from the first quarter?","Matthew J. Flannery","I think that the demand that we're seeing early here in the second quarter, I would characterize as strong. I would feel that we've had a great first 2 weeks to the quarter, right on plan. But this is the normal seasonal build that we expect in the strong environment, and I do feel we're in that strong environment. I wouldn't really call it pent-up. I think the major projects that would create that demand, as Mike had stated earlier, really need a lot more planning than to get too far thrown off tilt by 2 or 3 weeks of bad weather. We -- I hope to see that maybe in that unassigned, and that's why we want to make sure we're touching those customers, more of the small projects that we didn't see kick off in Q1. It'd be nice to see that pick up and that would be a surprise. But other than that, I wouldn't see a pent-up demand effect.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just on rental, clearly, it's been a bright spot in the broader machinery industry overall. I mean, imagine there've got to be other folks that are clawing to squeeze a little bit more into rental business. Now are you seeing any signs of increased competition? And what are your expectations on the size of the fleet and just overall fleet growth in any of your key categories in 2013?","Matthew J. Flannery","So as we depicted about our $1.5 billion gross capital spend and what does that add, almost $500 million to our fleet, we feel that, that's a consistent growth pattern for us over the next couple of years. We're not seeing anybody work above that pattern that concerns us, specifically in the local markets. We're seeing some fleet replacement, which is great to see. A lot of people have been conserving capital over the last couple of years. But we're not seeing any ultra-aggressive growth in any of our individual markets that shows new players coming in.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yes, the only thing I would say is where we're spending capital, as you can imagine, is in the power HVAC and in the tools section and also trench as we continue to feed the growth that we're seeing in those markets. But beyond that, I think it's going to be pretty much the same of what you've seen in the past.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on power and HVAC. Can you just talk a little bit more about specifically what have been the drivers more recently in the growth you're seeing? And where is rental penetration now for things like small generators relative your overall business?","Michael J. Kneeland","Well, the power HVAC is different than the small generators. It's really a larger-sized generator. It's more of a system than just a generator. So what's driving it for us is we said the harmonization that we have with the contracts that opens the doors where typically the requirements were met by third party. But also, we can now pursue that, and we can pursue it with confidence that we can get more of that business. And in fact, we are. So we're continuing to do that greenfield starts by expanding our portfolio so that we can serve those customers is another avenue. On the tools side, it's really -- it's a whole new system of rolling it out. United Rentals is very good in larger construction projects, whereas RSC was very good in the industrial side. So taking that tool opportunity and deploying that into some of our larger customers. And it's a benefit for them. We're solving it. It's a solution to a problem. It's efficient. We're in, we're out, and we can track everything. So those -- the growth on that is really opening the eyes and cross-selling across our portfolio of customers and our geographic footprint.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just lastly, on the balance sheet, I mean, it seems pretty clear you're focused on generating a lot of cash this year and deleveraging the balance sheet. Is there a number in terms of a debt to EBITDA where you would realistically have to get to before you would consider another medium to sizable acquisition?","William B. Plummer","Ross, we don't think about it as a target that we would hit before we do an acquisition. I think Mike articulated how we think about the acquisitions earlier. If we line up those 3 criteria, strategy, economic attractiveness and sort of culture integration risk, and we can rationalize that we're not putting ourselves in a significantly disadvantageous leverage position, we won't shy away from doing acquisitions that make sense. That said, the hurdle is pretty high. And we think we've been pretty disciplined about when we do, do acquisitions in the past, and we'll continue to be disciplined going forward. So I don't know that there is a litmus test of leverage that would say, yes or no, we'll do an acquisition. It just depends on what the opportunity is that's in front of us. That said, we do have an overall strategy on the balance sheet in terms of leverage of being between 2.5x and 3.5x debt to EBITDA. We'll be at 3x by the end of this year, and that gives us plenty of room to do acquisitions and still be true to that approach to the balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Michael, can you talk about whether you're seeing greater pricing momentum in your monthly book of business or on the shorter term side? Obviously, the shorter term business led the rental rate recovery, and I'm wondering if you're now seeing the monthly momentum accelerating faster than the shorter term rates.","Michael J. Kneeland","As far as -- it's harder to quantify that, number one. Number two, I would just say that the monthly rates take time because we have contracts that are outstanding. And as they come off rent, you can re-class them and come out with a higher rate. It's safe to say that our monthly rates continue to improve as we would expect. And as Bill mentioned, to the harmonization was also an uplift that we've seen. We continue -- the day and week, the day is more spot and weekly is less so between the 2. We have the system in place that monitors it, and it enables us to manage it very efficiently. And so I don't know if there's -- if I perfectly answered your question. But the monthly continues to improve.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to flesh out the cost synergy discussion a bit more, Bill, if you don't mind. Did the pace of SG&A savings really accelerate this quarter? I guess, I was under the impression that early on, you got the cost of rent savings really quickly. And I'm wondering, did the SG&A accelerate this quarter because that $29 million is pretty significant here?","William B. Plummer","Yes, I'd say most of the SG&A saves happened early on. Right? Most of them came in the form of headcount actions and other actions that you can just do and be done with, and so I would say they did not accelerate. The one SG&A item that maybe got a little better this quarter is the impact on our bad debt expense. But the other SG&A items, I don't think you could say accelerated in any significant way during the quarter. It's the operating, the expense saves, the cost of rent saves that will build -- will continue to build to take us up to the fully developed impact that we talked about, $230 million to $250 million annualized. So that's the way I'd think about it. But in terms of the first quarter, SG&A, they built but it wasn't a major ramp-up, if I remember the numbers correctly.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, Bill, on Slide 11, when you talked about SG&A, is that a combination of the corporate overhead and other efficiency bucket? Can you just define that for us?","William B. Plummer","It's the corporate overhead, it's the field overhead, those areas combine. The other efficiencies are primarily operating and procurement saves. So in that breakdown that we gave you, the SG&A stuff is those 2 overhead slices.","Operator","Thank you.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Operator. Welcome and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.","As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive while presenting some notable constraints. And we delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA on $1.3 billion of revenue, with lower rental rates partially offset by higher volumes.","It was a solid performance, particularly in light of the challenges of oil and gas in Canada. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $627 million, and we're on track for free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion this year, in line with our outlook.","But behind the scenes, our results showed some encouraging momentum. While utilization was down 10 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year, it was up year-over-year, both February and March, driven by increase in OEC-on-rent. The utilization in March increased by 100 basis points.","Taken in total, these numbers reflect a good quarter. The obvious disappointment was rate, and that's a major focus for us. In fact, we believe that we can improve our rate management in this year's operating environment even though there is still some uncertainty out there.","I'll start by summarizing what we know, then what we don't know about 2016. We know that the cycle appears to be intact; volumes continue to be strong across a majority of our businesses. Secular penetration is still a tailwind and demand from non-residential construction is on the rise. We also know that our industry added a lot of fleet last year. The new fleet, combined with equipment coming out of Canada in the oil patch has created an oversupply in U.S. markets in the short-term. However, our services are still earning premium pricing. Strategically, this is the right positioning for us in the long-term.","Canada was the major constraint. The drag from our Canadian business was significant in the quarter. It accounted for almost a full point of rate decline, and we're managing through it by reducing fleet in weak markets, particularly in Western provinces.","So, we're pleased to see that the Canadian Government is taking steps to turn the economy around. And importantly for us, the current plan includes an investment of more than $120 billion in Canadian infrastructure over 10 years, with $11 billion to be allocated immediately.","So, let's talk about what we don't know. We don't know when supply and demand will achieve equilibrium, no single rental company controls that timing, but we do believe the market is moving in that direction. Independent data indicates that the growth in supply is now tracking below the growth in demand.","Rouse reports that their absorption ratio hit an inflection point in March of last year. The timing makes sense when you think about the decline in oil and gas. Then, the negative ratio hit bottom in November and has been improving ever since. Last month, the ratio was close to parity, and it's the best we've seen in a year. If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx in 2016, excess fleet will be absorbed more quickly by the growth in demand.","Oil and gas is another question mark, and there's plenty of speculation, but no certainty about the future of this sector. We don't think upstream vertical has hit bottom, yet. And finally, a change in the relative strength of the American dollar would affect the results we report from Canada, and that's a challenge to predict.","So, it's been a series of puts and takes. But when you analyze all the various dynamics, it comes down to the size of market growth and the cycle is still very much on track. And in our view, it will be several years before it reaches its peak. It's also the consensus of industry analysts that supports that view, as well as our customers'.","Nevertheless, our experience tells us that pricing will be very difficult to predict in the short term. And while rate is just one component of our outlook, it underlies some of our other metrics. Consequently, we made some adjustments to our guidance, as Bill will discuss in a moment.","Before I move on, I want to emphasize that our focus continues to be on managing our business for significant long-term value. And as a leader in our industry, we're not willing to be a bystander. We're taking every measure to ensure that we generate the highest possible returns on our capital over time, and that includes managing rates more effectively.","We're also being very diligent about taking cost out of the business. Our lean initiative is on track to reach an annual run rate of $100 million in savings by year-end, and we're committed to that target; and we see more room for improvement next year.","Now, let's talk about CapEx. In the first quarter, our capital spend was down by two-thirds versus last year, and it gives us major flexibility in managing the balance of our CapEx spend in 2016. Last night, we reaffirmed our $1.2 billion CapEx target for the full year and this is based on the substantial demand that we're seeing in many of our end markets.","So, here is a quick snapshot of the quarter. Non-residential construction in U.S. increased year-over-year by more than 11% through February, which is the latest data available. It drove up equipment rentals across a wide range of verticals. We saw year-over-year revenue increases in some of our largest end markets, such as infrastructure, chemicals and refining. And we generated double-digit growth from verticals that are important targets for us. These include pharmaceuticals, entertainment and disaster recovery.","Our specialty rental operations are continuing to turn in strong performance. Rental revenues were up 8.7% year-over-year for specialty, with same-store growth being more than 6%. And the combined rental revenues from Trench Safety and Power & HVAC, our two largest specialty businesses, increased by 12% year-over-year, again largely on same-store basis.","With our pump business, we're continuing to diversify our market base, both in terms of verticals and geographies. In the first quarter, we opened cold starts for pump in Tennessee and Minnesota. Specialty is an area of our business that we're funding for growth again in 2016.","We have a lot of investor interest in these operations. So, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to a branch visit on May 5 in Tampa. We're taking investors to a co-located trench, pump and power branch starting at noon. It's a good opportunity to spend some time in the field with several of our key leaders, including Paul McDonnell, who runs our specialty business. Space is limited, so please give us a call this week if you're interested in attending.","So, in summary (9:04) and realistic about 2016. We've looked at this year from every angle and the prospects for equipment rental in North America appear strong, demand is building and our fleet on rent is keeping pace.","And our focus continues to be on many aspects of our business that are within our control. These include asset management, our cost structure and cash generation. And you'll see us flex all these areas as conditions warrant, while strategically we'll stay the course in a year to offer significant opportunities to deliver for our shareholders.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill, who will go over the results with you. So, Bill, over to you.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now.","Starting with rental revenue, $1.117 billion of rental revenue in the quarter, that was down 0.07% or $8 million year-over-year and the components are as follows: re-rent and ancillary revenues netted out to an increase year-over-year of $2 million, ancillary was up a little bit more, up $4 million, offset by re-rent coming down slightly.","Within owned equipment revenue, the decrease totaled about $10 million, with rate accounting for about $28 million of decline, on that 2.8% year-over-year rate decline that we reported. And that was almost exactly offset by volume being up pretty strongly, $28 million of volume contribution on the 2.7% increase in OEC on rent that we reported.","Netting against that is the replacement CapEx inflation for the quarter, that was about $20 million of year-over-year decline, reflecting about 2% impact from the inflation of the CapEx that we replaced. Mix and other was a solid positive contributor this quarter, plus $10 million versus last year. And that very largely reflects the fact that there was an extra day in the reporting period this year. So, net all that together was $10 million of decline in OER as I said, and that totals the $8 million of decline that we saw overall.","Within that revenue decline, I'll point out that we did have an impact from the Canadian dollar. It's weaker this year by about $10 million worth of rental impact. So, if you excluded that Canadian dollar currency impact, we actually would have reported an increase in our rental revenue of 0.3%.","While I am on Canada, I'd also point it out that that's just the Canadian dollar impact. If you just look at the U.S.-only performance in rental revenue, our U.S.-only rental revenue was actually up 3% in the quarter, that's up 3% when you exclude Canada.","Time utilization performance in the quarter actually trended very nicely as you went through each month. The overall quarter, as you saw, was down 10 basis points, but within that, we had a decline in January of about 150 basis points and then February, the utilization flipped to a positive 30 basis points, on its way to the 100 basis point year-over-year improvement that we reported in the earnings release. So, we're on a pretty good positive trend in utilization in the quarter.","Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $115 million of proceeds from used this quarter, was essentially flat with last year. The margin of 48.7% was down just over 2 basis points and that's primarily driven by some of the discounting that we've done to move volume in the quarter at a little bit higher pace than we might otherwise have done.","When you look at the margin overall, 48.7% adjusted gross margin is still a very high level of margin in absolute terms versus where margins have been historically.","Within that used equipment sales result, we sold about 60% of our revenue through the retail channel, consistent with where we were in the first quarter and consistent with what we've been trying to do to focus much of our sales effort through the retail channel. So, a solid used result in the quarter to get us started for the year.","On profitability, just real briefly on adjusted EBITDA, $584 million, was down $18 million or 3% versus last year and the margin was 44.6%, that was down 120 basis points. The key components, that rate impact that we called out earlier, cost us about $27 million compared to last year, but that was offset by the volume impact, which was a positive $18 million in the quarter.","Fleet inflation was a headwind of about $12 million, so the net effect of all those was really driven by the rate result and inflation. The ancillary revenue impact that I pointed out earlier was a benefit of about $2 million in the quarter. That offsets the used equipment sales result, which was a negative $2 million in the quarter compared to last year.","And then we had our normal merit increase impact of about $6 million in the quarter, and the mix in other benefit primarily driven by that extra day was a positive $9 million in the quarter. So, all of that nets to the $18 million year-over-year decline that we called out.","Sprinkled throughout that decline was about $3 million worth of headwind from the impact of currency that occurs in various lines here. So, that $3 million was reflecting that $10 million decline in revenues that I talked about from currency.","Briefly on adjusted EPS, we delivered $1.40 of EPS in the quarter, and that was $0.06 better than last year. And again, that overcame the impact of Canadian currency, which was about $0.02 headwind compared to last year in the quarter. So, a solid EPS result for us during the quarter as well.","On free cash flow, good quarter there, $627 million in the first quarter, that's up $177 million versus last year. The key drivers there, obviously the lower CapEx spend in the quarter was a benefit of about $223 million year-over-year. We also had lower interest expense of about $20 million. And offsetting those two benefits, were really timing of working capital that cost us about $67 million versus last year. And obviously, the adjusted EBITDA result, decline of $18 million. So, those are the key components of that $177 million improvement.","I would caution against running too far with the overall results of $627 million in the quarter, as you think about the full year free cash flow. The timing in some of the subsequent quarters will weigh that down. Still we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1 billion worth of free cash flow over the full year.","On rental CapEx, you saw the $100 million in the quarter, down to $123 million versus last year and that's consistent with the approach that we've taken to rental CapEx this year, which was to give ourselves as much flexibility as we can early in the year, and then decide, as we go through the year, where it's appropriate to spend. So, we still are expecting to spend $1.2 billion across the entire year for rental CapEx, the quarters will vary this year as we respond to demand.","On liquidity, real briefly, we finished the quarter at $1.4 billion of liquidity, just over $1.4 billion, and that reflected about $1.2 billion in ABL capacity and another $200 million in cash on the balance sheet.","Let me just touch on the share repurchase program briefly. We purchased in the quarter $153 million worth of shares, that resulted in about 2.7 million shares coming back to us and if you look at the entire current authorization, the $1 billion authorization we're operating under, we spent about $264 million through the end of the quarter against that program.","So, we're on the pace that we talked about. As we think about the share repurchase program, our intention right now is to continue the way that we've said. Steady purchases toward about $675 million or so worth of repurchases this year, and they will be fairly steady throughout the months.","I've mentioned before, the restricted payments limitations that we have to make sure we operate within from our debt covenants. As we finished the quarter, we had about $566 million worth of available capacity, either from RP baskets in the debt or from cash capacity at the holding company, so we're very well-positioned to continue the share repurchase program without concern about those limitations slowing us down.","ROIC for the quarter was 8.7%. That was down 30 basis points from the prior year and clearly reflects the impact of the weaker rate environment after netting out the somewhat stronger demand environment and higher utilization.","Let me finish up with just a real brief comment on the updated outlook. You saw the numbers with total revenues coming down to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA coming down to a range of $2.650 billion to $2.750 billion. Essentially we adjusted both ranges down to reflect the renewed outlook on rate. It's impact is about $100 million, and so at mid-point, it was about $100 million. So, that was the motivation for revising those components of the guidance downward.","Our new view of rate is now for a decline of 3% to 4% over the course of the year, and really that reflects the experience that we've had early in the year. We can talk about the sequential rate performance that we had in the first three months of the year, but it's fair to say that those came in weaker than we expected and the new rate guidance for the full year essentially reflects that decline.","Our utilization is going the other way; we've had a stronger start to the year on utilization and on fleet on rent. And so, we now expect our utilization for the year to be up about 100 basis points. That will bring us centered around 68.3% for the full year.","No change to the CapEx plan, as we've mentioned before. $1.2 billion is still the gross spend that we're targeting, which should net down to about $700 million after used sales proceeds. And again, no change to the free cash flow outlook, between $900 million and $1 billion.","Final comment is just regards to April. We've got a lot of questions about how April has started, so we figured we'd offer up just a little bit more thought about that. On the rate front, it's fair to say that April has started slightly better than what we saw sequentially in March. We'd call April, so far month-to-date, it's something like a sequential minus five-tenths (21:04). On utilization, it's also slightly better than where we finished out. As of yesterday, our utilization against last year was up 130 basis points.","So, we think it's important to understand how the early part of the year plays out. And as we think about the remainder of the year, we're optimistic; optimistic about our ability to put fleet on rent, about our ability to start realizing rate more effectively than we have. And as always, we're going to drive as hard as we can toward all of those objectives.","So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steven.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Bill, I know you said the rate outlook for the rest of the year reflects the beginning of the year trend, but I think you are assuming sequential monthly declines for the balance of the year. So, maybe just give us a little more context for why it makes sense to assume that the rates are going to decline sequentially for the rest of the year as they did last year. Just because \u2013 we are seeing oil prices rising and the over fleeting may be moderating, as you're talking about, and the volumes are good. Can you just kind of give us a little more color there? Thanks.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I'll start out and please chime in Mike and Matt. The rate range that we give, actually, if we achieve the 3%, you would have some positives in the back half of the year on a reasonable profile of where sequentials would go. So, it's not like we're saying, there's going to be declines every month in the remainder of the year. And in fact, if we repeated last year's sequential performance from May on, that puts us right about the mid-point of the down 3% to 4% range that we gave. And there were some flat months in last year's sequential decline.","So, we're not here saying that there are going to be sequential declines every month going forward. We're saying that we want to make sure that we understand how our business looks if you don't get a significant turnaround in the short-term. The reality is we did start weaker than we thought in the first quarter, and things don't turn around instantly. And so, we're trying to allow room for things to take a little bit longer to turn around, but we certainly believe that that's a possibility and that's why we put the range the way we did.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And how are you thinking about the trade-off between rates versus volume utilization? I mean, to what extent are you making a conscious decision this year in favor of volumes versus rates, and any sense of how you think your market share has trended this year?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Steve. This is Matt. I would say that the two are connected, but the strategy of trying to drive both rate improvement and time improvement has not changed. Our time utilization doing better than we had originally thought was mostly due to demand and even overcoming some of the headwinds that Mike talked to in his prepared comments in Canada in oil and gas. We have some real strong end markets. I'd say 70% of our regions \u2013 and those are the ones that aren't touched by oil and gas and you could think about it geographically as on the coast \u2013 have robust demand. And that's what we're taking advantage of.","As far as, what's that balance between rate? That's more of a supply dynamic. And we added a slide, on slide five of our investor deck, where you start to see where the absorption of the fleet coming in has been over the past year and where we're starting to see some improvement there. And that informs the stronger end of our range of 3% rate. That's what we're driving towards and we believe the supply side will work its way through because there is such robust demand.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I would add to that is \u2013 this is Mike, by the way, I would just add that, in my opening comments, we still maintain a premium. So, we're not sacrificing. The market is the market. This is the first year in, what, five years that we haven't had \u2013 the industry has had oil as the backdrop, and we understood that. And we also are looking at ways in which we can drive efficiencies in our fleet and our CapEx spend. So, we took CapEx down as well in Q1. So, we wanted to see demand. We're seeing demand, and that's what gives us a lot of comfort for the cycle still playing out.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So, just to be clear, in these markets where you are seeing the volumes that you're not seeing just excessive amounts of competitive pressure?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, if you think about our rates, Steve, and you separate out the U.S. and Canada, we're not where we wanted to be in the U.S. Our rates in the U.S. are down 2% for the quarter versus the 2.8%, and that's driven by \u2013 in the tougher markets where there's not demand, where there's not time utilization in Canada, our rates are down 9.7%. So that's really where the big drag is. If you took oil and gas out of the number, large oil and gas, our rates would have only declined 1.6%.","If we had numbers like that holistically, we wouldn't have re-guided rate. We would have overcome that. We would have felt like, with our rate management systems and the robustness of the focus, we wouldn't have had to re-guide. But when you put the whole experience in, we just thought it was appropriate to give that guidance, I just want to reiterate: we're driving towards the better end of that guidance and even beyond. This is not a statement of a lack of focus; it's more a statement of realizing what we experienced in Q1.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, George.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide further detail on what's changed in the Canadian and oil and gas markets over the past 90 days that prompted you to lower your revenue and EBITDA guidance?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, George, maybe I'll start and ask Matt and Mike to chime in. I think it's just a continuation of what we saw late last year, right. Remember in the fourth quarter we talked about Canada being down significantly. I can't even remember the exact percentage decline in revenue, but those factors that continue, right. We continued to have adjustments in the oil sands projects, and the western part being a major driver there, continue to have pressure on some of the commodity pricing that affects other industries elsewhere within Canada. And that's being exacerbated by all the fleet looking for a home and moving around in that marketplace. So, I don't know Matt or Mike, you guys point anything else specific that might have changed in the last three months.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I wouldn't put it just to Canada. As Bill had talked about in his comments, if you carry through what the rate build was planned to be in the year, which had our initial guidance and you carry that through the balance of the year, that's why the revenue guidance dropped. It wasn't just specifically Canada and I think we spoke about that in detail.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. I'll jump back in queue.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, George.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Joe.","Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC","On slide five, when you show supply\/demand dynamics and we've seen the improvement over the last couple of months, the rate seems to contemplate that you still have pressure through most of the year when you compare to last year in sequential declines. So, why as we see that supply\/demand improving is there not the potential that things accelerate a little bit more quickly, why do you think that even as that improves and you find balance you continue to face rate pressure?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, this is Mike. It's the unknown. We know the snapshot of where we are today. We know what we're spending and how we're spending. We've taken down our capital spend significantly. It's what I don't know is going to happen for the rest of the industry, and what they intend to do and spend.","So, it is projected, as you stated, according to Rouse that it looks like some time at the end of the second quarter, you could expect some sort of equilibrium. Now, I can't control what the rest of the industry does. I can only speak to United Rentals. But, it gives me \u2013 what I've seen it so far and what I hear from OEMs, it gives me confidence that our market \u2013 and we're marching in the right direction. That's the unknown. And is there opportunity? Yeah, that's why if I look at the 3% to 4%, there's some opportunity for some positives. But, we have to call it as we see it, and put it up, and kind of de-risk it a little bit.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I would add, Joe, I think, it's just how quickly can we change the momentum, right? And that's probably what we're after. The good news, as Bill pointed out, April, we started to see an improvement in momentum, and how quickly that plays through, we'll see where we get to reaching our goal of 3%.","Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the U.S. only, and rate down about 2%, and obviously commodity-related pressure, but outside of that, are there any pockets that you're able to identify, whether it's on the national account front or whether it's the walk-in business, where you're seeing a little bit more of the contribution of downward pressure on rate there.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, we've seen pressure in different category \u2013 excuse me \u2013 different customer segments. I think that reflects the overall dynamics of what's going on in the marketplace right now, right. It's an excess of fleet, and that fleet is going to look for a home, and whether it finds a home with a large national or a mid-sized regional or a mom \u2013 a small walk-in oriented market, I don't think it discriminates.","So, we've seen pressure in a variety of different areas. I think, the key for us is to make sure that we support our strategy, right, which is make sure that we're embracing those large national accounts, is the core part of our strategy. And then continuing to offer the services that justify the mid-sized and the smaller players coming to us as well, and to do all that at a price point that reflects the premium service that we offer. So, I don't know again, that Mike, I'll ask if you guys want to add anything, but I'd say, I wouldn't point out any particular group of customers or project types that represent the price, the pressure on rate. But that's another way of saying that we've seen some pressure in a variety of different areas.","Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question, please.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, the question is on Canada, and obviously it's tough there, and probably particularly in the west with the oil and such. And I'm wondering if you can speak at all to either the competitive balance or the speed at which you can reduce fleet and normalize. I don't know whether it's more consolidated and therefore you can kind of get things in line faster, just when you anticipate given the plans you have up there, even if the market continuous to be soft that you've taken enough fleet that we can sort of stabilize a bit?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Robert, this is Matt. I think, you're hitting on something where the real challenge markets are pretty dense. And when you're thinking about Western Canada and more specifically Alberta, we've been very aggressive in moving fleet out of there. And that's been able to help us right size our business, and we're seeing, it's broad-based in Western Canada. We're seeing our competitors face with the same challenges. It's a macro issue and not a performance issue with our team or a market share issue. It's really just a macro issues in Western Canada. I want to separate out Eastern Canada because I think they might even have some opportunities in some of the provinces in Eastern Canada. It's just not robust enough to call out, but because it's concentrated in certain areas, we are able to move the fleet profitably.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I'll follow-up again offline. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Seth.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning,","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, sticking in Canada, not surprisingly, I guess what's struck me is \u2013 thanks Matt, for the 9. \u2013 I think you said down 9.7%, that was good data, and I think, you \u2013 in the fourth quarter, it was down 6%. I guess, what I think people are trying to figure out is when do these comps start to anniversary, because it seems like there's been a lag here relative to the inflection in oil last year. So, I think what everybody is trying to calibrate is, when do the Canada comps specifically get easier? And then also maybe can you talk about \u2013 is this all just direct energy exposure or you're also seeing indirect knock on type project activity slowdown in those markets as well?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Seth, I'll start. I think, we saw Canada declining really throughout the year last year, but the acceleration really was most pronounced in Q4. And so, in that sense the comps really started to get easier in Q4 although they will be gradually getting easier as we go through the year. Matt, I don't know if you want to answer the question about concentration in oil and gas and \u2013 or is it more broad based?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, most of us realize, right, so it's a very highly driven by natural resources, the whole country quite frankly, and I think, it was just exacerbated in Western Canada, but it's something that as Bill pointed out was really driven in Q4 and Q1 this year, and during that period, we pulled over $70 million of fleet out of Western Canada. So, we've been very aggressive in dealing with it, and I think, I would leave it at that. I mean, it's \u2013 it'd be hard for me to parse out knock on versus the racks, I think, the whole economy, and if you're in Alberta, almost the whole economy is somewhat oil and gas related, and that's where we've seen the biggest drop.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Seth. The only thing I would add is if you take a look at one of our investors' deck, the industrial outlook for Canada by province, I think, is a good way of looking at it, and it's not just oil and gas, it is minerals and metals that are all wrapped in there. You know as well as I do Canada is reliant on commodities, natural resources, with the Western taking the biggest part of that, particularly in the oil. And you see that highlighted in our deck by province, reduction outlook on industrial spend that they see in Canada, offset by growth both on the east and the west, far east and far west.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I mean, just to frame it though for the \u2013 I think, 9.7% down in the first quarter, would you expect second quarter to be in that same kind of range or does it that \u2013 does that start to get less negative here in the second quarter?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","If I \u2013 so, we haven't proven to be great forecasting it, to be frank. But I would say that we're expecting our improvements to come in the U.S. and that's where we think the opportunity is, that's where the greater demand is, and where we expect to get our rate of growth.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. But I'm just talking about it on a relative basis, I mean, okay. Maybe if I could slide another one. Just on the CapEx, Bill, second quarter last year was, I think, close to $700 million gross CapEx, is that...","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...order of magnitude, should we haircut that by 20%, 25% kind of number, consistent with your full year, or how should \u2013 is there any kind of help you can give us for just to calibrate that?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Sure. So, the intent is to respond to demand, and that's going to drive the number, so that's why we hesitate to give you a more specific guide. What I would say is we could spend as much as we did last year. If the demand continues to hold, and if we can land the fleet from OEMs. But we could spend materially less than last year, and I know that's not terribly helpful, but it could be \u2013 in the area of $600 million, it could be in the area of $700 million, just depending on how the demand plays out as we go through the quarter.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI Group. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, David.","Operator","You might have your phone on mute.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I'm sorry. Yeah. Sorry about that. I appreciate you taking the question. I know it's looking out to next year, there's a lot of movement in oil and gas that could change things and so forth, but on your slide 18, just trying to think about the midpoint of your CapEx is basically net CapEx goes up 27%, 28%. And when I think about the way you're laying out the rest of the year, you actually exit the fourth quarter with rental rates down over 3%. But in that slide you're saying you think there'll be modest rate growth. So, I'm just trying to think through, if I'm going to raise CapEx that much in 2017, I'm exiting 2016 with a lot of negative carryover on rate. Obviously, I guess, the answer could be you're just that bullish on 2017. I'm just trying to think through how that makes sense to start the year that negative on rate, you're going to raise net CapEx mid-point by 28%, and we think the full year rate in 2017 is going to be positive.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, David, so, there are a lot of assumptions in there. What I'd say is the \u2013 regards the exit rate from 2016 or the carryover into 2017, if you want to use the midpoint of our current rate guidance, right, down 3% to 4%. If we finish the year at the same pace as last year on the sequential, right, that approximately 3.5% set of sequentials, the carryover for 2017 in that scenario would be something like a point negative, right? So, we look at that and we say that's not insurmountable to overcome during the course of 2017 and get back to positive rate throughout the course of next year. So, that's how we think about sort of what we'd have to overcome in order to get to a modest rate increase next year.","As for the CapEx, we gave a range, right? We said it could be $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, I think it was. And we're using that as a statement that we're going to be very focused on preserving flexibility and responding to the market more so than just saying, hey, we're going to spend $1 billion \u2013 it was $1.6 billion at the top end of that range. We're going to spend $1.6 billion right here and now in 2017, come hell or high water, right. So, we're going to be responsive. We're going to be very mindful of how rates do behave as we finish up 2016, and that'll inform our thought about what rates are going to look like in 2017 and inform our thoughts about what CapEx plan should be as a result.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I was just trying to think through what some of your suppliers may \u2013 if you face that decision today, do you err on, I want to get that rate positive and I'll back away from the CapEx growth? I know the CapEx, though, is going more specialty than general rent, but I'm just trying to understand \u2013 is the focus still on we want to push rate? And obviously, last night's report made some people question, is it about trying to play a little catch up on some volume growth and market share recapture or \u2013 no, it's just the dynamics of this year and next year. Of those two, you would err on: we'll pull the CapEx down to make sure we get the rate.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, David, this is Mike. We haven't changed our stripes. We took CapEx down this year. And the easiest thing I could do is just throw CapEx in. To your point, our growth CapEx is going to specialty. As we go through the year, it depends how it plays out, is how I think \u2013 how we think about it. We don't know. We're giving ourselves the flexibility, but we haven't changed our strategy or our story as far as how we're thinking about it. This is \u2013 we're not going to throw out CapEx for the sake of volume.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I think \u2013 thought it was interesting that the rate breakdown that \u2013 even if you pull out large oil, and I assume that was large oil out of U.S. and Canada, that the rate was still down 160 bps. Was \u2013 is that \u2013 I mean, in a way is that almost more the surprise, that the rate degradation in non-oil and gas areas?","I mean, it's just a little more \u2013 I know there is a hangover in the whole oil and gas contagion, equipment moving to other parts of the country. So, it's interesting that rate even outside of oil and gas is down when the utilization \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong. The utilization's probably stronger outside of oil and gas. I'm just trying to marry that up so I understand the kind of core gen rent business outside of oil and gas.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","David, as I had said earlier \u2013 it's Matt \u2013 it's the supply side. And we saw that mid-year last year, and you saw it in all the Rouse data. There is just more fleets that came in that didn't get absorbed. And if it ended 2015 that way, then we knew there was a first half of the year dynamic, just because of seasonality, where it was going to put more challenge on it. So, I would say that it was less \u2013 we didn't have an expectation that rates in the U.S were going to be positive in the low season Q1. And I think Canada has just really, really surprised us even more so. But this is the supply-side dynamic we've been speaking about for the last few quarters.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Well, that's what I'm trying to understand. I mean, obviously we all try to figure out the supply-demand balance. But when you think most iron gets delivered now, all right, April, May, June \u2013 I mean, obviously, your CapEx in particular is heavily second quarter. So the idea of forecasting fleet versus demand, I mean, we haven't really seen the real fleeting up this year, right; seasonally, it's still to come. And when you spend time with dealers, it doesn't seem like the rental CapEx is even going down this year versus last year, which would still be fleet growth. So, I'm just trying to understand \u2013 it's not your data. Maybe it's not a fair question to you, but...","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I mean, the fleet, to measure it in March and say, hey, we're near balance \u2013 I mean, you haven't taken delivery, yet, right? Most of the delivery comes the next three months or four months. I mean, there's still a supply-demand question that naturally isn't really answered until June-July, right? So, I'm just trying to understand how much are we embracing that forecast when we don't really know what's being shipped, yet; but it seems like the dealers aren't really backing off much right now on year-over-year CapEx. I mean, you're doing a good job cutting. I'm just trying to understand, how could I make that forecast off of March fleet when all the fleet comes in the next three months?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, we can't \u2013 we obviously can't comment on sort of the dealers and what's going on there, but what I would say is, you're right. The fleet tends to come now, but so does the demand. And what we're taking as encouragement is that the relationship between growth in fleet and growth in demand seems to be one that's near or heading toward balance. And you couple that with the pain that the industry has suffered overall regards an excess of fleet, right, low utilizations over the last \u2013 well, since oil broke, really. We think that there is a very reasonable case to say that the industry will continue, even though they're bringing in more fleet, bringing in less fleet, than demand might otherwise warrant and that will help with absorption. So, that's the mindset that we're bringing to it, time will tell, whether it's right or not, that's why the uncertainty is, why we're being very flexible and how we approach spending capital this year, right, but based on...","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I'm sorry. One last thing on the positive side, I'll try to catch up though. On the positive side, I think, Matt, maybe in particular you've answered this, but all of you, there's no more need to move any iron around, would you say? I mean, you've \u2013 hopefully, you're past that point. You feel like Canada seemed like these last three months getting some stuff back to the suppliers and so forth on buybacks and stuff. I mean, where Canada \u2013 I know, the rate is down, and obviously, Matt, you're weren't willing to say rates are getting much better year-over-year, when you said the U.S. has improvement, but are we at least comfortable with where the iron generally is right now, like are we past that point?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we believe so, and I think that's a fair depiction of where we are and we're going to be moving a lot of fleet around as we always do. But I think the big moves of having to move major blocks out of any geography, I think, we've swallowed that pill.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","That's good to hear. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.

Your question, please.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","I wanted to ask more about the demand in that industrial non-construction segment of the market. And so, looking at the slide deck, you've got a 2.2% forecast in 2016 in the U.S., clearly oil and gas is down, but can you talk more about what you're seeing in manufacturing and petrochemicals, refineries and the like? So, anymore color on trends, and kind of where you're seeing Greenfields there?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, last part of your question, I didn't catch, Nick.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Just trends in the industrial segment of the U.S.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think that's obviously the one decline or \u2013 but really one of the few declining verticals we've, we've talked about ad nauseam, which is specifically upstream oil and gas. We've actually seen some improvement in certain markets in refining. We've seen great improvements in chemical and infrastructure. And, I think additionally, and Mike \u2013 I think, it was Mike referred to it in his opening comments, we have some targeted vertical efforts, admittedly in some smaller verticals like entertainment and restorations, where we've been \u2013 we've been very encouraged by what we're seeing through those efforts and that's a strategy change that we're going to invest in and continue to implement as an organization. So, I think that \u2013 there is a plenty of robust end markets, both vertically and geographically that we feel comfortable with the level of capital being able to be deployed profitability.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I would only add to that is, there's still some revamping of some automotive plants that are underway, and will probably play out for the balance of this year and to next year.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you give us an update on pump solutions, so what performance looked like there? And any kind of update on your ability to cross-sell and put that equipment into sectors other than oil and gas that you talked about?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nick, pump is tracking fairly well for us in terms of coming in relative to what we had planned for the full year. In the first quarter rental revenue was basically flat and that's where we had our mindsets coming into the year. We're having pretty good success in looking at verticals outside of oil and gas and driving the cross-sellers we talked about for some time here. So, we're feeling good about pump relative to the forecast that we had for the full year.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, this is Mike. I would only add that, in those numbers, upstream oil and gas is down about 70% on a year-over-year basis, with revenues they're relatively flat. So, we've been diversifying our portfolio very nicely and we still see increases in opportunities in the cross-sell.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Michael, can you talk about, as we get out within the next, call it, three months to four months based on the performance that you folks are at it (51:51) for utilization mid-April and applying normal seasonality. You'd be pretty close to your utilization high by the third quarter and I'm just wondering what is it that's making you folks a little bit shy about getting more aggressive on pricing as you hopefully get utilization to those levels? Is it a situation where you feel like you're that far ahead of the industry in terms of the utilization difference where you want to see the rest of the industry catch up or has it just been a tough environment, you want to make sure the demand is there before you start to push pricing? Can you just calibrate us on how you're thinking about that?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Jerry. I think it's important to recognize that \u2013 obviously we don't control pricing in the marketplace. We respond to a significant extent, but at higher levels of utilization, we have more room to select those rental transactions that are most appealing from rate, and it gives people some confidence in being able to quote rates that are a little bit higher. So, that dynamic we expect to play out as the year goes on, and that's why we're encouraged by our ability to improve our rate realization.","When it gets to absolute sequential increases, it will depend on things that are outside of our control, including the overall level of industry fleet, and the level of utilization of that fleet in the industry, that's why we spend so much time talking about how industry fleet is being absorbed. You used the word confidence, it's a matter of confidence to say that you are going to start moving sequential rate higher several months down the road.","Our experience recently has made us to be mindful of getting too aggressive and far out ahead of where the market actually is. And so that's why we put the rate forecast out there that we did. The key for us is to make sure that our management processes are focused on realizing as much rate as we can in the marketplace. And if we do that and if the industry absorbs more of the fleet that's out there and avoids bringing in a lot of excess fleet to compound the problem from here, then the rate we realize is going to be better than what we got in that guidance range. But it's hard to put that down in black and white in a forecast as we sit right here.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Jerry, the only thing I would add to that is, what lessons learned last year has made us a better company. We have a lot more rigor and control around our fleet and our capital. And we've made significant improvements in our process. That gives me comfort, number one. If you were to ask me, okay, hey, Mike what were you thinking when you gave us guidance in January, given the numbers that we posted there. I would tell you that we go through and the team goes through a rigorous process to figure out what has to occur, what has to be true on rates and utilizations.","And as Bill mentioned, they're moving targets in one direction or one aspect to the other. So, in January, our plan called for being down 0.3%, we actually finished 0.4%. So, tenth of a point, not bad, but it really was in February and February is always a swing month for us and then it was really \u2013 it leans on March. And then, as March played out, that's when we \u2013 as we've talked about that the whole got bigger, but the demand was picking up and we started seeing that demand and you see that in the numbers that we've talked about.","So, it's a balancing act, we think, we can improve on that, that's our goal, that's our job and we'll continue to focus on it as we go through the year and report out to the best of our ability how we see the world playing out.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the color. And historically, RSC, before you acquired the business had a high proportion of its contracts expiring at around calendar yearend. Has that changed at all and what are the implications for rate next year if those contracts re-price at lower rates exiting 2016 than where we were exiting 2015?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Jerry, it's Matt. So, most national account contracts get negotiated somewhere around yearend, either a month or so before or a month or so after, it depends on the length of negotiation. We're not seeing \u2013 so, we've renegotiated just about all of our national account agreements for this year already and we're not seeing really any significant different performance than the overall markets that they work in.","So, the Canadian national accounts are maybe faring a little bit better than the overall market, but in the U.S., our national accounts are behaving like the rest of our business. And, usually that's the way it's been throughout the last few years, both pre and post acquisition. So we don't foresee any difference.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate it.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer and Matthew Flannery, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Mike Kneeland","Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone, and welcome. With me today as operated stated is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer and other members of our senior management team.","Typically on the fourth quarter call, I\u2019ll summarize the key results and then turn to the coming year and I know this is all adventurous in our operating and volume and we\u2019ll certainly address that today. But I also want to touch on the broader invocations of our fourth quarter results. 2012 as you know it, was not a typical year for us and I think it\u2019s important to view the quarter in that light. First, the results we reported were clearly strong finish to a very good financial year, a year which we transformed the company for superior returns.","In addition to the merger with RSC, we\u2019re also successful executing our strategy in an expanding marketplace. Second, the numbers reflect a substantial progress, we made on the integration for the beneficial effect on margin and the alignment of our operations is now largely complete and we\u2019re working together as one.","Bear in mind that the merger happened less than a year ago and we realized some significant efficiencies in the brief time. In the fourth quarter, we captured another $42 million of cost synergies bringing the total to $104 million for the year. Before I recap the numbers, I\u2019ll remind you that any year-over-year comparisons I give you are on a pro forma basis, as measure against the combined results of the United Rentals and RSC for 2011.","On the top line, our rental revenue for the quarter was up about 90% year-over-year and total revenue was up more than 7%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $553 million for the quarter and a 44% margin, that\u2019s 580 basis points higher than the same period last year. And our flow through was a very robust 125% for the quarter. These results stand on their own, but they become even more meaningful as a part of our trend towards superior performance.","Now, over the past year, as you know we\u2019ve used these calls to explain how we\u2019re becoming more discipline in running the business from value creation and each quarter the poof was in numbers and the fourth quarter was no different.","A number of factors worked in our favor including a modest improvement in the construction environment in 2012, a continuing trend toward market penetration, which is increasing the size of the industry pie, and a robust user core market.","Now within our won company, we had a more balanced mix of rental revenue with non-construction accounting for about 50% of our business and effective focus on key accounts with the application of our technology for their needs. A 7% increase in the volume of in our rent and a 6% increase in our rates we charged for our equipment.","Time utilization was 68.7% which although lower than last year was still very strong in our much larger fleet and the ongoing optimization or our field operations, in the fourth quarter, we closed 14 branches, nearly all of them merger related.","So we had a mix of factors, most of which were created to our own networks and some presented by the microenvironment. But in every case, we were intensely opportunistic and making these factors work to our advantage. And in the final months of 2012, our regions were still dealing with the tail end of the integration, but even so, they turned in very solid performance.","13 of our 14 regions had year-over-year growth in rental revenue for the quarter and 13 regions had year-over-year increase in rental rates. Of those 13, a 11 regions had a quarterly sequential rate increases, so demand held up going into the off season. Rental revenues from key accounts grew 14% year-over-year and within that group, national accounts grew 16%.","Another shining star was our trend, safety, power in HVAC business. It had an extremely strong quarter. Revenue from specially rentals grew 37% reflecting demand for construction, industrial and emergency response application. So, that\u2019s a quick snapshot, and Matt is here and we available during our Q&A to answer any questions about our field operations and the integration.","I want to talk to you about 2013 and give you our insights. As you saw our outlook, we\u2019re projecting strong growth in both revenues and adjusted EBITDA and very strong free cash flow. Our expectations for rates and utilization are in line with demand that we\u2019re seeing for our services. And we feel confident that we can drive more improvement in rates, while increasing time utilization year-over-year. And we plan to do this, while investing over $1 billion of net rental CapEx to our fleet.","A several years ago during the worst of the downturn, it was extremely difficult to plan our current market conditions. And we\u2019re operating in a very murky economy, but to a lesser degree that\u2019s still true. Nevertheless our projections for 2012 were on the money and that puts exactly where we expected to be in 2013.","Now the end markets that are showing signs of growth, especially in oil and gas and power sectors and we see continued trend toward secular penetration driven by the growing appreciation for the economic benefits are raining and we have a broader deeper value proposition that we can now bring to market.","Time and again, our senior customers come to the realization that they\u2019re wasting money by owning fleet that sits idle. And these customers see rental as a sound business strategy, which should continue to elevate demand and the recovery.","Now if you with us on our Investor Day in December, you know that we feel that we\u2019re still in a very early stage for a meaningful recovery. The macro consensus seems to be in line with global insight, which estimates the U.S. equipment rental industry to grow by 8% in 2013 and by 11% in 2014. In private non-res construction, which accounts for half of our business is projected to grow about 6% in the U.S. in 2013 with accelerated growth in 2014 and we think these are all reasonable forecasts and are supported by our own customer surveys as well as surveys from other sources that serve in the same markets as we do.","Also we agree with forecasters who think most of the market momentum in 2013 will come in the back half of the year. This is all good news, but I\u2019ll reinforce something I\u2019ve said in the past, we believe our strategy, our scale and our customer service will keep us growing faster than our end markets.","And I want to spend a minute on customer service because it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re very serious about service as a differentiator. We know the attributes of great service are in the rental business, and we\u2019ve built up a lot of credibility by focusing on those attributes. We track them at branch, district and region levels through metrics that measured customer service, fleet management and process efficiencies. And if a branch starts to slip on its on-time delivery, a manager knows it very quickly or if a district is having with the particular metric, are people who are on it. We also have companywide goals in 2013, like a more streamline rental process and a metric called OEC unavailable for rent and we\u2019re very focused on improving that number. We are also running a tight ship when it comes to the safety. And I\u2019m proud to say that we had a full year pro forma recordable rate of 1.4 for 2012 and that\u2019s our best safety record performance yet.","Moreover 84% of our branches had zero recordables for the year and as far as we know that\u2019s the best safety record in the industry, and we\u2019re going to keep driving all of our branches towards zero. So what else you see from us in 2013, great question. You will see us continue to focus on technology including total control system or identifying key accounts, we can benefit total control to help them lower their equipment costs. You also see us rule out the mature model to more markets. This model uses dedicated repair hubs and essentially managed field services to improve our margins in high density areas.","We now have 20 successful implementations of our mature model in cities in Toronto and San Diego. With another 20 \u2013 excuse me another 15 or so planned for this year. We also go hard after remain of the synergies targeted, when we merge with RSC and we continue to expect we will reach a fully developed run rate between $230 million and $250 million of cost synergies in 2014 and we have plans to reduce our leverage that Bill will discuss.","The operating cash flow characteristics of our business are very strong and the timing of the merger has dovetailed nicely with market projections. So, when our favorable position reduced our leverage. Most important you will see us continue to deliver on our promise of improved profitability and higher margins. We just with our Branch Managers at our annual management meeting in Minneapolis earlier this month. Our managers are energized by the merger and hungry for growth. I think we all came away from that meeting that we are ready to take on the world.","One year ago, I stood here and told you that 2012 was not just about the deals we would make or the forecast we put out there. I said about we are delivering on our promise and to drive returns and you saw us deliver on that promise in 2012. Now, the bar is still higher and the stakes are bigger. And you can expect us to deliver again on 2013.","Now, I close in that thought, and return it over to Bill for the financial results and then after that we\u2019ll take your questions. So, now over to you, Bill.","Bill Plummer","Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. As always, I\u2019ll try to add a little bit more color to the quarter and the year that we just reported and also spend a little bit more time on our guidance for 2013. But before I get started, let me just remind everyone what Michael said that all of our discussion here is about our pro forma forecasted or actual performance, anything that\u2019s not pro forma, we\u2019ll call out as we go through.","So, let me start with our rental revenue performance for the quarter, up 8.7% year-over-year with good contributions from rate and volume as always. Rates were up 6% over the comparable quarter last year, and they were up eight-tenths of a percent sequentially versus third quarter of 2012. That brought us to a full year rental rate performance of 6.9%, very consistent with our guidance of about 70%.","If you look at volume and time utilization, we had nice growth in overall volume in the year; what we see on rent, which is our measured volume was up 7.2% in the quarter, to an average of $5 billion of OEC on rent, clearly reflecting what is an overall strong demand environment and certainly reflecting the investment that we\u2019ve been putting in our fleet over the last year, year and half or so.","Time utilization on that OEC on rent was 68.7% in the quarter and that by any measure a very strong level of utilization for the fourth quarter. It certainly consisted with the demand that we\u2019ve seen, consistent with the ability to deliver price and certainly is a focus of how we manage our business. It is down 90 basis points from the fourth quarter of the prior year, but I\u2019ll remind everyone that that\u2019s less of a year-over-year decline than what we have seen in the prior couple of quarters. And again, we remind you of the discussion that we\u2019ve had about the impact of the integration, the branch consolidations that we\u2019ve gone through, we are continuing to call back our leveraging of the fleet from that upheaval and we\u2019re making very good progress and I think that \u2013 that\u2019s smaller decline in year-over-year utilization demonstrates that.","For the full year, our time utilization was 57.5% and that was down only 30 basis points from 2011 and again I\u2019ll remind you that, that was on a larger fleet. The overall fleet, average fleet size for 2012 was up about 12% or roughly $770 million of incremental fleet and certainly putting that to work very effectively explains that 67.5% utilization across the year.","Before I move on to the profitability, just a word on our used equipment sales results for the quarter. We had a very strong quarter and indeed a very strong year for used equipment sales. In the quarter, we generated a $141 million of proceeds from used sales, had a very robust 39.7% adjusted gross margin and again that\u2019s the adjusted margin excluding the impact of the step-up in basis due to the merger accounting.","The margin reflects really a very, very strong performance in the channel mix. We had a great year as we drove more of our sales through our retail channel, 56% of our sales in the quarter were through our retail channel and that\u2019s up almost six percentage points from that channel share last year and you all know that we get our best results in that retail channels. So, great success there, we\u2019re having great success in accessing overall used equipment demand and that certainly portends well for our used sales going forward, which will continue to be robust.","Let me move now to profitability and start there with adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $553 million, and that was at a margin of 44.3%, so that represents an improvement of the $104 million of absolute EBITDA dollars. And that\u2019s 580 basis points better in margin than the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA came in at a $1.988 billion. And the margin for the full year was 42.6%. For that full year, that represents almost $500 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA, $490 million and 650 basis points more in margin than the same period in 2011, full year 2011.","Flow-through for the quarter, which we defined is the change in adjusted EBITDA divided by the change in total revenue. Flow-through was an outstanding 125% for the quarter. If you look at the full year, we had another great result in flow-through, 93% flow-through for the full year.","Then margin and flow-through performance overall reflects the strong and great environment clearly, but also obviously reflects the impacts of the synergies that we realized from the integration. Even if you exclude the synergies though, the flow-through story is still pretty robust. So, flow-through still had 74% impact in the quarter, if you exclude the synergies. And for the full year, it\u2019s comparable about 73% flow-through for the full year if you exclude the synergies that we realized in the course of the year.","If you move down to EPS on a profit basis, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.27 and it\u2019s worth pointing out that $1.27 reflects an underlying tax rate that was just under 30%, 29.5% to be precise. If you look at our GAAP, tax provision for the quarter, you see that we actually reported a tax benefit of about 5% on a GAAP basis, but that benefit is really driven by the effect of a couple of key items in the quarter.","So, we had, you all know a refinancing of our 10, seven, eight notes during the course of the quarter and we reported a loss for the premium pay to refinance that issue, that loss was recognized in the United States as a deduction and therefore push down the U.S. pre-tax income very significantly and our tax \u2013 our effective tax rate as result mix more significantly toward Canada, which you all know has a lower tax rate.","So, that was a very significant mix impact that drove down the underlying tax rate on a GAAP basis, but it was further exacerbated by the fact that we had favorable settlements of tax audits really around the states and in particular in Canada during the quarter. So the discreet items there were very, very favorable for the tax impact in the quarter and that was a significant part of driving that 5% tax benefit in the quarter.","All in all though the EPS performance on yield basis is pretty strong. As I said, the $1.27 reflects about a 30% tax rate even if you wanted to use the 35% tax rate, our view of adjusted EPS would still be in that $1.17, $1.18 area. So, a good strong EPS performance.","Let me move to integration just briefly and talk about the $42 million of synergies that we realized in the quarter, a very robust integration performance that has been the case and we believe, we\u2019re comfortably on track to deliver what we\u2019ve talked about is $230 million to $250 million of fully developed cost synergies. And the contributions were pretty solid across all the different areas of synergy deliver in the fourth quarter. So, the $42 million brought us to $104 million. As Mike said, our synergies in the fourth quarter and it sets this up very nicely to continue to drive those synergies through 2013.","Before I move to the outlook for 2013, let me just touch on free cash flow and capital structure and liquidity briefly. Free cash flow, this is the only measure that, that I\u2019ll talk about. That\u2019s not pro-forma adjusted. We report free cash flow on an as reported basis and that number came in for the full year at $223 million of cash usage.","Keep in mind \u2013 excuse me, keep in mind that includes the impact of all the restructuring and merger related payments that we made in cash. That impact was about a $150 million at cash. So, if you net out the $150 million of merger related cost, we had a free cash flow usage of $73 million for the year and that is within the range that we guided to between minus $25 million and minus $75 million for the full year.","Turn to our capital structure and liquidity. We finished the year with the total of $782 million with total liquidity, within that $654 million was ABL capacity and the remainder was cash and our AR facility and I remind everyone that as I mentioned just a couple of minutes, during the quarter we redeemed our 10 (inaudible) notes and incurred a significant interest expense charge to do that, roughly $72 million was the impact that played through our P&L.","Before we move to Q&A just on 2013 outlook, just briefly. Since Mike hit the high numbers just a little color. We put the revenue on the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, that\u2019s total revenue. Within that the rental revenue performance we expect to be driven by our rental rate expectation at 4.5% year-over-year that includes a carryover impact in where we finished 2012 of about 2%.","For time utilization, we are expecting about 68% for the year, that\u2019s a 50 basis point in improvement for the year and again continues to reflect the focus that we put on driving our utilization performance. Reducing the fleet unavailable for rent as Mike pointed out will be an important focus there and certainly that will help us drive utilization more effectively without having to invest capital underneath it.","Adjusted EBITDA for the year, we expect to be between $2.250 billion and $2.350 billion for the year so midpoint of $2.3 billion. Our net rental capital expenditures, we expect to be just over a $1 billion, a $1.50 billion and that reflects roughly $1.5 billion of gross rental CapEx and the difference being proceeds from used sales.","Full year free cash flow for the year, we expect to be between $400 million and $500 million and as we\u2019ve discussed in the past we\u2019ll use that primarily to reduce our leverage. On leverage we certainly expect a significant move during the course of 2013, we\u2019re right now saying that based on the guidance that we\u2019re providing that we should finish the year at right about three times debt to EBITDA and it will be that number whether we use any of the cash proceeds to finish out our share repurchase program or not. So a very nice deleveraging coming during the course of 2013.","Those are the key points that I would make right here and now there are plenty of other topics that we can talk about in Q&A. So certainly look forward to your questions, we can move to that now. Operator, let\u2019s open it for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Set Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","Hey, good morning, guys.","Mike Kneeland","Good morning.","Bill Plummer","Good morning.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","I just wanted to get a sense for how committed you are to holding the line on this $1 billion net CapEx number. What sort of the optimal mix here if you can get 68.5% utilization and keep the 4.5% rate, I mean would that trigger a higher CapEx number or how are you thinking about the balance there, because your 68% number would actually be above what you\u2019ve done the last couple of years.","Mike Kneeland","Yeah, this is Mike. I\u2019ll answer at this way. Look we are trying to drive profitable growth, if I were to see both rate and time, start to accelerate, I have no hesitation to spend more, but I would like to see the both of those come into play. And the other thing is I would say is that \u2013 a lot of free cash flow and we\u2019ve got a lot of blue-sky in order to meet customer demand.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","I mean as you\u2019re looking at your guidance, would you think that there is more relative upside to the rate number or to the utilization and which would push \u2013 would you prefer to push rate I guess versus utilization if you had a choice.","Mike Kneeland","I think you know me. I would tell you that obviously rate is near and dear to my heart has the biggest flow through and the highest potential for our margin expansion. And I think that, that\u2019s a fair statement. So, rate I think, if you go back last year, we started out the year saying 2005, we ended up just here underneath 2007. We will continue to focus on it. We are going to continue to drive it and I think the team is low equipped. We got tools. As I stated in my opening comments, we\u2019re now a unit as one and we\u2019re going to focus on that.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","And are you seeing anything from a competitive standpoint, are the smaller independent guys refleeting or they becoming more aggressive with pricing or is everybody kind of being rational here?","Matt Flannery","Hey Set, this is Matt. Overall, I think everybody is being very rational. And you know the national players are in much the same mode that we are and I think the rest of the industry is following suit and that\u2019s good for the entire industry. So, I\u2019m very comfortable and encouraged by that.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","I mean, but do you get the sense, the smaller guys are refleeting or they based on capital constrained.","Matt Flannery","No, I\u2019ve not seen a trend there at all.","Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital","Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Mike Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group. Your question please.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, good morning.","Mike Kneeland","Hi, David.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Two bigger picture questions. You keep referring to global insights outlook for 2013, but the guidance you\u2019re giving appears to be no better than the industry outlook, so I\u2019m just trying to see how you\u2019re framing the year end, you keep referring to your ability to penetrate and take share but your guidance is really only in line with \u2013 that seems like how you\u2019re viewing the industry. So, can you just sit back for a second and explain us why you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to outgrow the industry this year?","Mike Kneeland","I think David, the way which we look at the world, you can parse out the numbers however you want but we believe that we\u2019re going to outpace the industry this year. As I stated, and I continue to state whether it\u2019s driving profitable growth, but don\u2019t lose focus on the fact that our key accounts and our national accounts grew at very nice numbers and those are the areas that we continue to focus on, and you\u2019re going to see us put more effort on growing that segment of the business.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","I\u2019m trying to backdoor and to build town as the rental revenue growth for the year, because if you look at the implied used equipment sales, which is obviously the second biggest driver to your revenues, that implied to be up nearly 13%. Total revenues were implied only up 7%. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel are we thinking that rental revenues were up, 7, 8, 9, and 10, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for that, and then the segue question is, we\u2019re implying the core incremental EBITDA margins, forget about the synergies, dropping at 1,000 basis points year-over-year from roughly 73, 74, down to an implied 63. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for why are the incremental margins be 1,000 basis points lower and again why the rental revenue, maybe it\u2019s not faster than the industry, but if you can help us in any way with those two questions it would be appreciated.","Bill Plummer","So, David, it\u2019s Bill. What I would say on the rental revenue growth is, it\u2019s at a certain level, it\u2019s a systematical question about outperform the industry.","We do have a rental revenue growth within that center point $5 billion revenue number that we gave. That is an excess of anything that we\u2019ve heard from forecasting services for the industry in the year and we haven\u2019t given the exact number, but you can back into it reasonably close. I think you would have to know a little bit more about our assumptions for contractor supplies new equipment and so on in order to get super-precise. But we feel very comfortable in saying that we will outperform the industry in the year and that\u2019s what underlies that guidance.","In terms of the flow-through performance and the change versus last year, we view 63% as being very robust flow-through performance when you exclude the impact of synergies. That\u2019s \u2013 if you look back over the history of the company and the industry, I think you have to say that \u2013 that\u2019s a good level of performance, it is as good as the 73,74 range that we were in 2012, clearly not, but I think what we got in 2012, it\u2019s hard to imagine that you\u2019re going to be able to sustain forever.","We don\u2019t have as much rate realization assumed for 2013 as we actually had in 2012. That backs off the flow-through impact.","We aren\u2019t putting as much fleet in on a percentage basis in 2013 as we did in 2012 and you know the benefit of flowing more fleets through the fixed cost basis pretty significant. So, that would back off your flow-through in 2013. So, when you start parsing through the things that \u2013 that we wouldn\u2019t have there on our 2013 forecast, compared to what we had in 2012. It\u2019s not shocking to me that our flow through ex-synergies would be down and we can have a robust debate about how much they should be down. But we feel good about 63% ex-synergies based on what we expect for the year.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah. I\u2019m not denying to get absolute numbers. I was just wondering, you closed 187 stores over six months stretch. I have to believe that would hurt the flow through to some degree. But I guess you\u2019re seeing the other items, you cited more than offset the positives of 2013 won\u2019t have those branch closures?","Mike Kneeland","Yeah. I think along with the branch closures, there were variety of activities going on. I\u2019ll tell you, one of the things that benefited 2012 for example is as you\u2019re going through those consolidations and figuring out new responsibilities and how things are going to work, there is a level of uncertainty that\u2019s introduced the cost \u2013 some people to say, you know what? I\u2019m going to hold off on adding head count even though, I know that I might need to add head count.","So, in that environment, ex-synergies \u2013 you might actually be operating a little bit understaffed relative to where you otherwise should be. That\u2019s not going to be as much of an impact in 2013. At least we\u2019re not forecasting it to be. And so that\u2019s part of the story that causes ex-synergy flow through the back half a little big. But please don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that 63% is still pretty good.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","No, that\u2019s all fair. Right, I appreciate it. And quickly just on tax rate for 2013?","Mike Kneeland","We\u2019re saying the upper half of the 30s. So, 35, 36, 37, in that area.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you very much.","Mike Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc. Your question please.","Mike Kneeland","Hey, Joe.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc","Hey, good morning, guys.","Mike Kneeland","Good morning.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc","Mike, question for you on your metro model. I think you mentioned earlier that you\u2019re looking at about 20 current implementations and then maybe another 15 or so this year. I guess, one is that full opportunity and two, what percentage of your overall markets might fit within this type of model?","Mike Kneeland","I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m going to ask him, because he\u2019s deeply involved in it. So, Matt?","Matt Flannery","Great. Joe it\u2019s \u2013 so, it\u2019s 20 that are already implemented and another 15 that we\u2019ve got planned to rollout. There\u2019s probably another 10 to 12 after that. If you look at branch count, which \u2013 it is necessarily tied the revenue, it\u2019s about 50% of our footprint. It is condensed enough to take opportunities of shared services that the Metro Model offers. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but we\u2019ve been encouraged by the results of the models we had, and obviously the longer ones, and ones that have been in place in early first quarter 2012 have significantly better metrics than the company average. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by that.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc","That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s perfect. And then I know at your Analyst Day you talked about one to three points of EBITDA improvements from this. Is that still fitting for the some of the other markets, did you plan to roll this out this out too?","Mike Kneeland","Yes. So we\u2019re not certain yet, but if we \u2013 if we make the assumption that we took the biggest opportunities first, which would be a safe assumption, we\u2019ve probably frontloaded that and some of the additional markets that we rollout, you don\u2019t have as much density in. So, the scale may have some effect on where you\u2019re going to fall between that 1% to 3% range, but we expect to be in that range.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc","Excellent. Maybe one more for you real quick. Can you just dig into some of the moving pieces that would drive upside or downside to the 4.5% of rental rate guidance? And maybe just to add to that, it looks like both used and new equipment prices are well above the prior peak as opposed to the rental rates that are still below. How does new and used price play into your ability to raise rental rates, and I guess, is it normal for rental rates to lag this for behind?","Mike Kneeland","So \u2013 to your last question, I don\u2019t feel that the new used pricing really has an effect on our rental rate whatsoever. It\u2019s in the big scheme of things, it\u2019s not a driver for the \u2013 for end users, so the rental still such an attractive value versus all the cost that come along with owning, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of a decision process.","Your first question was about 4.5% rate, and if I recall what the opportunity is, we\u2019ve pegged 4.5, because that\u2019s it we think. If you look at the 2% carryover that we referred too, and then the figure at first quarter, some of the middle quarters are where we have our opportunity, we make some sequential assumptions that get us to that 4.5% rate that we are very comfortable with. If the demand picks up sooner, Mike had said earlier, the second half of the year we feel stronger. If we see the demand in the first half of the year increase more than we\u2019ve forecasted, we will \u2013 I think we have proven in the past, we won\u2019t hold off on getting that opportunity. And that can very well show up in rate.","Yeah, the other thing I would say just \u2013 look we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we possibly can. We\u2019re trying to make sure that everyone can try to look at how we see the world and the metrics to go behind the revenue that we\u2019re putting out there. So to the extent, it\u2019s a balancing act as Matt mentioned and we are going to continue to drive rate, it\u2019s \u2013 this is an industry that has to get over its cost of capital and to the cycle, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc","Sounds good. Thanks guys. Take care.","Mike Kneeland","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research.","Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research","How are you doing?","Mike Kneeland","Hi, Nick.","Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research","I want to ask about the impact of Hurricane Sandy, is there anything you can quantify there.","Matt Flannery","Yeah, Nick this is Matt, we had in the fourth quarter about $6 million of revenue that was directly \u2013 was a result of the impact of Sandy. There is about a third of that, that remains on rent today. So not a large number. As far as forward looking the start have been now starting to come in as far as the construction planning starts now that the \u2013 the government since approved the funding specifically for the Jersey Shore, but we forecast maybe $20 million, $25 million of additional what we see on rent in those affected areas so it will be big in that in those communities and in that area and we\u2019ll play a big role, but we don\u2019t see it as a needle mover a big impact on the overall company\u2019s scale.","Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you also give us rate by month on a year-over-year basis?","Mike Kneeland","Yeah. Rates by month on a year-over-year for the month of October, it was 6.5%, for November it was 6.1% and for December it was 5.3% and for the full quarter it was 6% on a weighted average.","Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay. And can you tell us anything about how things are turning into January?","Bill Plummer","Yeah. I\u2019ll take that one, so January is tracking as we expected both for rate and fleet on rent and time utilization. It \u2013 it\u2019s started \u2013 I\u2019ll step back and say one of the things that you saw this year with Christmas being on a Tuesday as we saw the latter half of December, things softened up a little bit more than you normally would see, if Christmas were on a Monday or Friday or over the weekend so the second half of December was little softer. And so we started the year a little lower than we otherwise might have. But we\u2019ve called out all that back and so January is on pace both in terms of rate and in terms of getting fleet into the market and it feels pretty good at this point.","Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Bill Plummer","Thank you.","Mike Kneeland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Mike Kneeland","Hi, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hi, guys. Congratulations on good quarter.","Mike Kneeland","Thank you, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Michael, I saw in come back to some of your comments about the end markets, I know you commented oil and gas and power were strong. Could you frame kind of were those strongest in 2012 and would you expect that to carry into 2013 as well or do you see other groups maybe improving in a relative basis and kind of maybe get a little more granular about the end markets based on the client surveys or the other metrics that you\u2019re looking at?","Mike Kneeland","I\u2019ll start with the client survey and it\u2019s a great point because our December survey of our customers, 62% of the key customers expect growth over 2012, which is up slightly from what we had in our last quarterly call. So, we take that as a takeaway from our customers\u2019 confidence level is \u2013 is beginning to rein bullish and we take that as a positive.","With regard to some of the industries, the power sector is still an area, where we are \u2013 we participate in, in a broad sense and we think in 2012, it will continue in 2013. We could debate whether there is a pipeline, there is an half a lot of work is being done once we\u2019ve got all of the \u2013 all of the wells are drilled for natural gas and for wet gas. It\u2019s an efficient way of fuel and we see that demand.","Bill Plummer","We\u2019re also having a colder winter than last year. Unlike last year, there was more, one of pause, because there is oversupply of natural gas.","Mike Kneeland","And given that the temperatures that were \u2013 we are unfortunately going through right now, whether it\u2019s rather cold that\u2019s going to I think acerbate some of the demand or the need for that fuel in energy sector.","Our power grid continues to be \u2013 needs to be refurbished, that\u2019s underway, and it\u2019s a long-term project. The same goes for coal and all of fossil fuel plants, their aging repairs ongoing, and then I would say that \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is more investment in the chemical side of the business, particularly in the Southwest or in the Gulf area and from foreign investment coming in here, but stable, and we have lower energy prices. And so we\u2019re seeing more of that start to play out inside of our industry. Having said all that, I\u2019ll also point out that one area that we\u2019re looking at markets, we don\u2019t see there is a growth in Northeast Canada, it came off of high. It\u2019s still going to grow, but not at the rate we saw historically. Western Canada will remain strong and that\u2019s \u2013 hope I answered all of your questions.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Yeah, that is helpful. And in terms of \u2013 just I was hoping to next touch on the synergies for 2013, and I don\u2019t know if this is a Matt question or Bill question or Michael, but the guidance is for step up of, I think, $96 million. Could you help us understand what that allocation looks like between COGS and SG&A, and how the realizations in 2012 split between those two buckets?","Mike Kneeland","Ted, I\u2019ll take a stab at it, and Matt certainly feel free to chime in. So, as we look at what\u2019s to come in 2013, I would say there is a majority of it that comes in cost of rent, because it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s clearly become out of areas such as operational head count metrics that we track, delivery efficiencies that quite honestly we haven\u2019t recognized any synergies for as of yet, but we know that there are some benefits that are going on, we just got \u2013 get our heads around how do we capture them and calculate them. So the majority of that incremental 96 will be in the cost of rent lines of the company, that said we still don\u2019t have opportunities in SG&A. I think there is still some process changes to play out in some of the administrative areas, but it will be skewed toward cost of rent during 2013.","We have been more heavily skewed toward SG&, savings so far in the $104 million that we realized in 2012, and that\u2019s just natural, right. A lot of it came out of reducing redundancies in the corporate functions, reducing sort of the management structure in the field and we\u2019ve done a nice job of that, it\u2019s gone very well. The stuff yet to be is going to be more \u2013 is the hardest stuff quite honestly, but stuff that\u2019s more directly tied to operation.","Matt, do you want to add anything?","Matt Flannery","Bill, touched upon on it right, a lot of the operational efficiencies, you need to time to actually achieve right, so specifically as we report achieved synergies, you\u2019ll see more achieved synergies from branch operations coming in 2013 than you did 2012, and we\u2019ll get to our 200 million achieved for the full year and that bring us to a run rate of 220 by year end 2013. So most of the achievement will be done by year end 2013, to get to our 230 and 250 fully developed plan.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Got it. The last thing I was hoping to ask is and I apologize if I missed it earlier. How should we thinking about the cadence of CapEx for 2013? Is it falls in normal splits of 60:40or?","Bill Plummer","It\u2019s \u2013 Ted, it\u2019s Bill, again. We\u2019ve thought very carefully about it this year and so I think what you will see is that the cadence by quarters in 2013, will look a little bit more like what you\u2019ve seen in prior years like 2011 for example then what you saw in 2012.","We\u2019re very heavily frontend loaded things in 2012 roughly I think I have got the numbers here in front of me. In the first quarter we spent about 36% of our total year spend last year in the first quarter and then another 35% in the second quarter and then it went 18% and 11%.","For 2013, I think you can look for us to be more like what we were in 2011, which was 19% in the first quarter of 2011. We\u2019re probably going to be around that \u2013 around that level again this year. And then the second quarter may not be dramatically different than it was in the prior year, so probably 35%, 36%, 37% in that area. We\u2019re probably loaded a little bit more of a spend in the third quarter than we normally might. So, call it 30% or so, and then remainder in the fourth quarter of this year. That\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s important you understand the pacing, so that you get a good sense of how that capital spend will play out across the year. That helped?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","That\u2019s super helpful. Best of luck this quarter, guys.","Bill Plummer","Thank you.","Mike Kneeland","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Mike Kneeland","Hi, George.","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks and good morning.","Mike Kneeland","Good morning.","Bill Plummer","Good morning, Joe.","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Could you outline some of the specific steps that you\u2019re taking to ensure rental revenue growth in 2013 will outpace the overall rental market?","Mike Kneeland","Specific steps, I think, if you take a look at our investor presentation, Juan, who is our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, laid out a very detailed map of how we\u2019re looking at the world and how we\u2019re planned to attack it. Using total control, going after verticals, specifically and also implementing the sales force automation tools that we have out there, and \u2013 I mean, those are lot of dynamics that we\u2019ve laid out. It\u2019s a lot of the best practices that we\u2019ve learned between both companies of how we\u2019re going after the market. And core is another one that we\u2019ve rolled out and we got to educate the legacy employees and that\u2019s been fully laid out, and they\u2019ve been educated on that. And 2012 was as much as really kind of integrate and learn. So that in 2013 that we could be prepared. And those are probably the biggest things that I can think off. Matt, if you want to add anything?","Matt Flannery","Yeah, I mean if you\u2019re just talking about \u2013 talking about overall from 10,000 feet. We spent more time and energy in the past six months on preparing our sales team for sales force effectiveness through new tools in training then we have \u2013 in my 20 years in the industry and this I really think we\u2019ll see the benefit of that. On top of the stabilization of everybody being there, new territories, there are new stores and just the overall, the full year effect of having the team together I think we will be able to achieve the growth that we have forecasted.","Mike Kneeland","I would also point out that there is going to be some things that we are going to roll out this year, that we just haven\u2019t announced. We are going expand on some of the technology and leverage that, some of the best practices that we haven\u2019t yet implemented, will be rolled out, and you know so to be more to come.","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Next question is related to margins, the midpoint of your 2013, guidance suggest EBITDA margins of 46% will that be the new steady state or do you see additional upside to 46% beyond 2013.","Mike Kneeland","Well, I will be missed and tell you I think there is upside, right. Because the idea is that you know we continue to drive profitable growth. We have a lot of things that we are going to be utilizing some of what, we just mentioned some of the things around profitability by product and by customer, that technology exists rolling that out, implementing those type of tools, further capital efficiencies around, what\u2019s not available for rent all to margin improvement. So, for me I would tell you that there is just more to come.","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Very helpful. And then last question, could you give us some color on how much revenue synergies you expect to achieve in 2013?","Matt Flannery","Hi, this is Matt. We haven\u2019t pegged specific number on it. I will say that we are well on target to hitting our commitment of $50 million of incremental EBITDA that we reported last year is our target. And if you recall that will come at a high flow through, because where we are getting that will be somewhere between 460 million and $70 million of additional revenue.","And I\u2019m not even trying to avoid giving you an answer. The real challenge is unlike cost synergies, we have set things in motion to achieve revenue synergies, but we actually have to build the revenue, which is going to come throughout the year to take credit for. But we do feel that we\u2019ve the actions in place to meet and probably exceed our plan.","Mike Kneeland","Yeah, on that point, just to point out, the harmonization of all the contracts, although we kind of, almost all being done, they are not all done. We\u2019ve got about 90% done. We\u2019ll get the balance of those baked into this quarter. I think Matt\u2019s exactly right as you see the quarters unfold this year, you\u2019ll see more visibility around those numbers.","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Right. Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.","Mike Kneeland","Thank you.","Bill Plummer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein from Citigroup. Your question please.","Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup","All right. Thank you. Good morning and congrats again on a good year and in terms of the acquisition as well, in terms of your integration. Question back in terms of the EBITDA guidance, Bill and if you kind to walk through some of the key pieces, I\u2019m trying to get a feel for how we should think about the volume impacts.","And you just mentioned that the incremental costs synergies of that\u2019s give you call it $100 million incremental benefit. The benefit from rate should give you another call it $180 million and obviously these are not given of course. But I\u2019m trying to think about if you assume a more weak equal weighted spent on that billion of net CapEx implies about $500 million in higher pro forma average OEC and you\u2019re saying that utilization is up some on 12. So, what should we kind of an appropriate drop through range that we can think about on that incremental volume","Bill Plummer","Tim, so make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re looking for the drop through of just incremental volume alone.","Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah, exactly.","Mike Kneeland","So, what I would say is we haven\u2019t parsed it at that level, we got I mean we gave the guidance that shows you the increment \u2013 the drop through for overall revenue, whether it\u2019s price, volume, mix, whatever \u2013 fleet, whatever is implicit in the guidance. And David Raso earlier talked about 63% if you exclude the impact of synergies. We haven\u2019t broken out the incremental impact of volume at that level of detail. So, I\u2019d \u2013 I actually don\u2019t even have number committed to memory that I\u2019d want throw out there. Clearly volume is going to be a focus for us. We\u2019re putting more fleet in. We\u2019re going to raise utilization and certainly that\u2019s going to be a key driver of our overall profit improvement. But why don\u2019t we leave the discussion at the total revenue level.","Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. All right, fair enough. And then, Bill, in terms of the mix impact, how should we just kind of bridging that price versus volume and then the additional kind of unknown. What should we think about from a modeling perspective in terms of what that mix factor looks like in 2013 as you\u2019ve moved more of your business toward to these monthly contracts.","Bill Plummer","Certainly. So as we look at 2013 and what\u2019s implicit in the guidance is a mix impact that\u2019s somewhere around a 0.5 of headwind. So, 4.5% rate whatever your model for volume is and explicitly we\u2019re saying about a 0.5 of mixed headwind, that will give you the high-single digits creeping upon 10% revenue growth that\u2019s implicit in that overall total revenue growth that we\u2019ve guided to. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Mike Kneeland","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?","Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning. I have two quick ones and then one more philosophical. The first where do we stand on the stock repurchase authorization and where do we stand on the RP basket? And then the last one is, with regard to acquisitions clearly the integration of RSC is going well. In 2013, would you consider looking at other targets of upsides?","Mike Kneeland","So on the share repurchase, Phil, we\u2019ve got about $85 million left to do, and we will \u2013 we will manage that the way we said initially, which was we\u2019re going to get it done over in 18-month period post \u2013 post the close, and we will just spend it as we go along. In terms of the RP basket, I\u2019m going to look over at Irene, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sitting here, and say where is that on your cheat sheet, Irene, help me?","Irene Moshouris","It\u2019s the acquisition notes, and then the most restricted within the $50 million.","Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I\u2019m sorry could you say that again.","Irene Moshouris","$250 million.","Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you, Irene. And I guess Michael, maybe the acquisition question?","Mike Kneeland","Yeah, with acquisition, we always are going to be focused on driving profitable growth, I would say, and you\u2019re going to hear me say that over and over. Strategically, it has fit, it has to \u2013 there have been a lot of rigor around this, it also has to be accretive, and the cultural fit. And having said all that, we always look at what\u2019s out there and I think one of the areas that was very evident that we\u2019re going to be focusing on is our specialties side of the business, which is a very high return and bodes very well with our current customer mix, as we go forward. So again opportunistic, but no need to rush out there, and we\u2019ll continue as we stated earlier, we\u2019ve got a lot of free cash flow and not only this year, but the years to come. So, but we\u2019re going to be in a position.","Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s great. And then maybe I can just ask, are the number of books coming across your desk, are opportunities increasing or decreasing in terms of potential M&A that you\u2019re analyzing?","Mike Kneeland","I don\u2019t measure it in that way. I think that people try to get into \u2013 and to talk to us to get a sense of what our thoughts are and I will tell you that I turn away as many years I open up, so I don\u2019t measure it in that form, it\u2019s just I think people are trying to understand what our appetite is and we\u2019ve got this \u2013 these integrations underway that\u2019s foremost on my radar screen. It\u2019s delivering what we said we\u2019re going to deliver and then some we got the best in class, we got to deliver on the best practices and then it has to be strategic. How can it fit with our long-term view.","Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Mike Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I want to open the call by saying that we are extremely pleased with the strong third quarter results we reported yesterday. It was a pivotal quarter and one that require disciplined execution in light of many different dynamics at play, both internally and externally. Some of our strategic actions we took to grow the business, others were market conditions that were broadly positive for our industry where we could realize more value through scale. And then there were the hurricanes, which created immediate challenges and longer-term opportunities. Now our third quarter results and our new full year guidance were shaped by these dynamics.","Well, I\u2019ll start by recapping some of the financial highlights. Now as a reminder, the year-over-year numbers are pro forma for the acquisition of NES in April, pro forma meaning the combination is presumed to be in effect for the third quarters of 2016 and 2017. Now one of the reasons we give pro forma numbers is to be as transparent as possible about how the business is performing, and in the third quarter our performance exceeded expectations.","Now here are our four key metrics that reflect well in our execution in the quarter. One is our volume of equipment on rent; we delivered volume growth of 7.6% year-over-year. This was a solid step up versus the prior two quarters. Second is rates; a major one in the quarter. We generated positive rental rates both sequentially and year-over-year for every month in the quarter. This is the first period since the second quarter in 2015 that rates were positive year-over-year.","If you recall last quarter I said that our rate trend looks encouraging, but we wouldn\u2019t rest. Well, we didn\u2019t rest, and I can promise you that we won\u2019t rest going forward. The industry backdrop on rates has become more constructive. And now that we\u2019ve turned the quarter, our team is excited to build on that.","Third is time utilization. This metric has been running at record highs and we delivered again in the third quarter. Utilization increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 71.9%. That\u2019s probably a milestone for the quarter as a whole, but also for each of the months individually. And fourth, free cash flow. Through September was a solid $582 million which is ahead of expectations. That\u2019s after nearly $1.5 billion of growth rental CapEx and another $52 million of merger and restructuring costs.","Before I move on I want to give you an update on our integrations. The heavy lifting behind us on NES we\u2019re tracking better than the $40 million of cost synergies we projected. With revenue synergies we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve the $35 million target by year three. The Cummins rental acquisition is just two months old and it\u2019s already paying dividends. The assets and the team we brought onboard are fully integrated into our Power & HVAC businesses. And the Neff deal as you know closed earlier this month. So that\u2019s a fourth quarter impact.","But here\u2019s an update on the integration. As of this week, the acquired branches are all running on our operating system. That\u2019s going to jumpstart our collaboration on sales and fleet. The rest of the integration is right on schedule. We\u2019re merging that back office sales, the operating teams, and adding telematics to the fleet. And we\u2019re analyzing the combined operations to identify efficiencies, as well as cross-sell opportunities with our combined customer base. None of these activities would ensure successful acquisition if we didn\u2019t have good people. And what we got with Neff is great people that come from a culture similar to our own. We knew that was true going in, and it\u2019s nice to see that first hand.","Let\u2019s step up in scale. Neff gives us a larger platform for growth going into 2018 just as NES did in the spring. Both acquisitions are timed to capitalize on the continued strength of the cycle. In fact, the operating environment in the third quarter was among the best I\u2019ve seen in a while. Our core general rental business which excludes specialty, jumped 4.7% year-over-year pro forma.","And from a company wide perspective, both the U.S. and Canada are trending well. Our business in Canada is up 9% in local currency. In the U.S. the coast remained strong and the Gulf and Southeast are starting to rebuild after the hurricanes. And our regions are broadly positive in their projections. In addition there\u2019s a lot of evidence pointing to sustained project activity, particularly in commercial construction. Our customer survey indicated that optimism has increased sequentially in the third quarter.","Given the demand is so broad, I thought I\u2019d share some insights into our vertical activity. In the construction sector, our revenues from both non-residential and infrastructure increased by double digits year-over-year, and that would have likely been the case even without the NES contribution. Infrastructure is a target of our Project XL initiatives. So clearly that\u2019s paying off. And now residential construction is our core business because of the mix of commercial projects is so diverse, a double-digit increase in that space is exciting to see.","In the industrial space with oil and gas we saw large year-over-year revenue increases across drilling, production and transmission. Refining was the only notable headwind and that\u2019s largely due to part of the storms. Elsewhere in industrial, the standouts in the quarter were the food and beverage, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. And by contrast, activity in the chemical processing industry was flat as expected. And overall I\u2019d say that we\u2019re in the strongest position yet to capitalize on the growth of industrial.","I want to comment on specially operations. Our Trench, Power and Pump segment delivered a major increase in rental revenue in the quarter of 33%, primarily through organic growth. Break that out, Trench was up 16%, Power was up 44%, and Pump was up 46%. I\u2019m most impressed by what the teams did with the margin. Rental gross margin for that segment as a whole increased 280 basis points to an outstanding 54.8%. And we\u2019re on track to meet our target for 16 specialty cold-starts by year end, and in 2018 you\u2019ll see us continue to grow that segment as a cornerstone of our strategic plan.","I also want to bring you up to date on the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria. We always hope for a quiet hurricane season. And while we don\u2019t always get our wish, this time the storms were particularly devastating. Our people are to be commended for how quickly they responded across our network. Harvey distorted hundreds of our employees and customers in Texas, some of them lost their homes and businesses. In Florida, the keys are still digging out and the West Coast has a long recovery. And it just wasn\u2019t limited to those two states; Louisiana took a hit, as did Georgia. In Puerto Rico where Maria was catastrophic, we\u2019ve been shipping fleets to our national accounts that are helping out with the recovery.","Now our best estimate is the storm-related business accounted for about $6 million of incremental revenue in September, and I\u2019ll share something else about September. In the aftermath of historic hurricanes in the middle of the integrations and at a time that peak seasonality we had just three minor reportable incidence for the entire month and that\u2019s new safety record for us. Something else came out of Harvey that makes me proud. And I\u2019ve spoken about our united compassion fund before. Our employees donate to the fund to help their colleagues. After the Harvey hit the compassion fund\u2019s board which is made up of branch employees voted to make Neff employees eligible for emergency grants even though the deal had not yet closed. That tells you everything you need to know about our culture.","So let\u2019s talk about CapEx. Our new guidance increases our CapEx plan to up to $200 million this year. And the broad growth of end market demand is starting to strain our fleet in some geographies. Our customers needed equipment for projects and we needed to be there for them. This is consistent with our strategy of protecting customer relationships that generate high returns over time, and we\u2019ll use a portion of the $200 million to address the natural disasters. And we expect this quarter to be a time of severe need for many of our customers. And so we\u2019re comfortable pulling some CapEx forward for that purpose. As always we can be very flexible adjusting the timing and the amount of our spend in a relatively short notice.","So I\u2019ll close with this comment on the quarter. The most powerful tailwind behind our growth has been our disciplined execution across a combination of factors. Our Project XL initiatives, prudent investments in fleet, accretive acquisitions, and most of all a robust market demand. And we expect the same combination to bear fruit in the fourth quarter and our updated guidance reflects that. The fourth quarter is also where we\u2019re seeing new benefits from the Neff acquisition, a further injection of rental CapEx and the market activity that we think will exceed normal seasonality. So in short we\u2019ve added horsepower at a time when the cycle is trending in our favor. That gives us a great deal of confidence about where we go from here.","So now Bill is going to review the numbers in detail, and then we\u2019ll go to Q&A. So, over to you, Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. As Mike said, there\u2019s a lot going on in this quarter, so I\u2019ll get to the bridges pretty quickly and then we\u2019ll try to address some of the other items that are present in the quarter.","Starting with rental revenue. As usual, let\u2019s go with the third quarter of 2017 totaled $1.536 billion, that\u2019s up $214 million over last year or 16.2% as you\u2019ve seen. We had a nice result in the quarter for ancillary and re-rent revenue, up $24 million on ancillary and $9 million on re-rent. And really that increase reflects the impact of NES along with the higher volume across our business overall. So ancillary is things like delivery, fuel our rental purchase protection program and so forth, nice increase there up about 18% over the prior year, and re-rent is re-rent of equipment that was up 19% as well.","The OER increase totaled $181 million. Volume was a major driver there. Volume attributed $208 million of increase year-over-year, and then rate added another $1 million on top of that. And the deducts were replacement cost inflation calculated in our usual way, that cost is about $17 million in the quarter. And then mix and everything else was a headwind of about $11 million there as well. So those are the key pieces for the revenue change.","The only other highlights for revenue include the impact of the storms. Michael mentioned that we recognized about $6 million of revenue incrementally for storm affected areas in the quarter, that\u2019s in the year-over-year change. Looking ahead that $6 million should grow to something like $20 million of storm-related revenue impact in the fourth quarter.","Moving to used equipment sales. $139 million of proceeds in the quarter, that\u2019s on a sale of $238 million of OEC equipment in the quarter. So $139 million represents a $27 million or 24% increase year-over-year in proceeds from used equipment sales, and that included about $26 million of proceeds for a former NES equipment that were sold in the quarter. I called that out because as in the second quarter those units brought along a higher margin based on the greater depreciation attached to the NES equipment. So that impact is coursing through the overall result in the quarter.","It shows in the margin. Our margin in the quarter for used equipment sales in adjusted basis was 56.8% and that\u2019s up 10.4% \u2013 percentage points over last year. So the NES impact is certainly part of that year-over-year increase, but not all of it. We are selling used equipment into a pretty strong market overall, I think that\u2019s supported by a number of external measures. But it\u2019s also very directly supported by our results year-over-year in our retail sales.","On a like-for-like unit basis compared to last year we were selling equipment in our resale channel, it\u2019s something around 5% higher prices than we did last year in the third quarter. So robust market overall, supported by the sale of older and more depreciated NES units, explains that 56.8% margin for the quarter. Whatever way you want to look at it though, it\u2019s a pretty good result for us. The average age of the units that we sold were about 93 months, and yet we still brought back over 50% \u2013 53.2% in fact of the original value of the fleet in our used equipment sales, so a pretty strong result down the line.","Moving to adjusted EBITDA. $879 million is an increase of $132 million over last year or 18% increase, and the margin in the quarter was 49.8%, that\u2019s 30 basis points better than last year. Similar story here, volume is the main driver, a positive $139 million impact from the 18% increase in volume, and rental rates contributed only another $1 million or so positive there. The strong ancillary result, we calculated $14 million of positive year-over-year contribution, and then our used sale result as I called out before the margin was up about $27 million year-over-year. Other lines of business contributed another $4 million outside of used rental and the ancillary that I called out previously.","The deduct fleet inflation we calculate is $12 million of headwind, our merit, our usual $6 million in the quarter. The biggest deduct was the increased bonus accrual that we had in the quarter. Compared to last year our bonus accrual program was up $28 million, that\u2019s an increase reflecting the strong performance this year, but it also compares to a slightly lower than normal number last year as we \u2013 many of you might recall we adjusted our bonus program accrual downward in the third quarter of last year to reflect its performance. So that\u2019s the biggest headwind, that leaves about $6 million, $7 million of mix and other negative year-over-year to explain the $132 million overall impact.","Just to call out the impact of the storm-related revenue on EBITDA, that $6 million of incremental revenue from the storm areas translated into about $4 million of EBITDA benefit spread throughout these various lines in the third quarter. And as we look to the fourth quarter, the $20 million of incremental revenue in the storm areas that I called out, we expect to translate into something like $12 million of EBITDA benefit in Q4.","Flow through from this EBITDA was 51.2% in the quarter, but that does include that merit \u2013 that bonus accrual increase that I called out. If you adjust for that $28 million, our flow through in the quarter would be 62% for the quarter, which is in line with the 60% that we typically \u2013 Mike talked about.","Moving to free cash flow. Mike called out the $582 million of free cash flow, once you adjust for $52 million of merger and restructuring related cash outflows, that number moves up to $634 million year-to-date through September. And I put out that number because that\u2019s the basis on which our guidance is given for the full year, excluding the merger-related and the structuring charges. So it\u2019s a pretty strong free cash flow result so far this year. It is down from last year at the same time last year was a particularly strong free cash flow year for us.","If you\u2019re interested in the year-over-year bridge, the main driver is obviously $200 million year-to-date of increased adjusted EBITDA is a good guide, but against that our rental CapEx is $340 million higher than it was last year, so that\u2019s a deduct. Our cash taxes are higher by about $100 million so far this year, that\u2019s a deduct. And then the net of interest paid merger and restructuring charges and all other working capital adjustments gets you to the $264 million delta between this year and last year.","Our rental CapEx expenditure for the year totals $1.5 billion so far year-to-date, and again that\u2019s up about $340 million versus last year, and reflects the higher plan spend but also adjust the overall strength in the market that we\u2019ve been addressing with our rental spend and maybe some timing differences this year versus last year. That net rental CapEx year-to-date is $1.1 billion, and again it\u2019s up about $325 million or so versus last year.","In the debt activity and liquidity it was a very busy quarter for us in our debt transactions. In addition to financing the Neff acquisition, we also refinanced our 6 1\/8 note. We upsized our accounts receivable facility by about $50 million, we have upsized our ABL by about $500 million, and we call the remaining balance of the 7 5\/8 notes that were still around all during the quarter.","The 7 5\/8 redemption will actually fund later this month in October, so it didn\u2019t show in the year end balance of debt, but the activity was very robust in the quarter. It left us with a net balance at the end of the quarter of net debt balance of $8 billion, up a little bit from last year. And again, I\u2019ll remind you that does not include the settlement for the Neff purchase. That settled on the second. And so when you add that funding net debt on top, our net debt balance right now is something about $9.4 billion.","We also improved our liquidity during the quarter. It shows at the end of the quarter it\u2019s $2.9 billion, but that did not take into account the payment for Neff. So if you make that adjustment, we finished the quarter with about $1.6 billion of total liquidity, including ABL availability and our cash balance.","Let me touch on share repurchase just briefly. You saw in the announcement that we announced the reauthorization of repurchases under the existing $1 billion repurchase program that we have, and that program has about $370 million remaining to be executed. The reauthorization is basically housekeeping. When we initially announced the $1 billion repurchase, we put a time limit of about 18 months on it. While we have the program paused as we settled in on the NES acquisition and got ready for the Neff acquisition, that 18-month time period expired, and so this was just a reauthorization of the same program.","Our intent is to evaluate our cash flow position for the remainder of this year after the Neff settlement and as we build our confidence that cash flow is on the path that we expect. We would expect to begin executing under that program with the intention of completing it by the end of 2018.","Real quickly on Project XL. We have continued to make good progress on the Project XL initiatives toward the $200 million run rate impact that we called out by the end of next year. A variety of the projects are all moving along nicely. We did put in the investor material a look at one of the other initiatives under Project XL, which is our focus on improving our realization of used equipment pricing. We look to improve it relative to fair market value of the units that we sell.","So we gave you a schedule that just shows you how we progressed on that year-over-year improvement measure throughout the course of this year and the cumulative EBITDA impact that we realized during the course of this year because of that improvement. I think it shows up in the commentary that I made about our used equipment results in the quarter earlier, and it is just one more view of the kind of thing that we are doing under Project XL.","Real quickly on the integration of NES. Just to give you a synergy update, as Michael mentioned, the integration is essentially complete at this point with the major actions having been taken already. And our run rate now for the realized synergies is nicely higher than the $40 million that we initially called out. For the sake of discussion, we could call it about a $40 million run rate. In fact, in the quarter, we realized about $10 million -- $45 million run rate, I would say, about a $45 million run rate.","In the quarter, we\u2019ve realized just a little over $10 million in Q3, and that puts us on a path to realize something north of $20 million, call it $23 million to $25 million in the full year of 2017. So nice progress there for the expense saves, synergies. And then regarding the fleet procurement savings, we called out a range of $5 million to $10 million, and we believe that we\u2019ll be delivering at the higher end of that range once it\u2019s all said and done.","Let me wrap up with some commentary on the guidance update that we gave. You all have seen the numbers, but just to add a little bit more color, the increase in our EBITDA and revenue guidance really reflects a couple of major drivers. Obviously, the impact of adding Neff in Q4 is included there, but it also reflects just the overall strength of the business that we saw build during the third quarter.","So I\u2019ve called that already. The impacts of revenue and EBITDA from Neff additions. So just to be -- I haven\u2019t done Neff. I did the storm-related. But just to give you some more insight on what Neff is included in that guidance update, we expect the revenues from Neff in the fourth quarter to be about $110 million, and we expect EBITDA to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $55 million from Neff alone.","On CapEx, Mike hit the real motivation behind our CapEx increase. Certainly, it\u2019s partially due to the demands from the hurricane-affected areas, although not from replacing fleet that was damaged. That amount was fairly minimal for us. If you look at both the Harvey and the Irma areas, in total, we lost about $13 million of OEC fleet due to the storms. So clearly, we\u2019ll have to replace those, but it\u2019s not a major part of the increase in CapEx that we guided. Really, that increase was importantly guided by the overall demand that has spiked in those hurricane-affected areas.","We\u2019ve moved about $100 million of fleet into the hurricane-impacted areas. And so we will up our spend a little bit to cover the fleet that came out of other areas into hurricane-affected and to put some more fleet back into those areas that donated into the hurricane areas. And then we\u2019re going to add a little bit more fleet that will land in the hurricane-impacted areas to help with what we expect to be a nice incremental demand from the rebuild activity as that plays out.","Maria, just to mention that, we haven\u2019t done a lot with Maria. We\u2019ve certainly shift some equipment to customers who are taking it over to Puerto Rico. We expect that there\u2019ll probably be a little bit more demand that plays out there as we go forward, but haven\u2019t really put a strong number to that just yet.","Michael mentioned that some of the increase in CapEx we\u2019re thinking about as a pull forward for next year, and that\u2019s certainly the case. That is the way that we\u2019re managing the uncertainty around how long the rebuild incremental demand will play out. If we see it play out for a longer period of time, then we can increase our spend next year to replace what was pulled forward into this year. But if it dies down more quickly than we expect, then we can adjust by thinking about the spend this year as pull forward for next year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color in how we\u2019re thinking about CapEx. But certainly, we can address it further in Q&A if a question is still out there.","Finally, on free cash flow, we increased our guidance at the midpoint, something like $75 million. And certainly, that reflects the increase in CapEx net of incremental EBITDA and any working capital impacts and just the other components of our free cash flow.","Importantly, our cash tax expectation in the quarter and in the year is lower as a result of the extra CapEx and the bonus depreciation attached to that, but also of the Neff addition, right? You all remember when we announced Neff that it brought along a nice tax -- cash tax benefit with the step-up in depreciation and small -- a balance of NOLs that Neff added. So as that plays out in the fourth quarter, it benefited our cash taxes and certainly was a part of that increase in our guidance for the full year.","That\u2019s a lot, but we certainly wanted to give you a little bit more detail on a variety of these areas to help give a sense of the impacts in the third quarter and what we think in fourth quarter. But certainly, we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions about anything I may have missed in the Q&A. So let\u2019s go to the Q&A right now. Operator, let\u2019s open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","Thanks very much. I was just trying to think through what you just reported and what you guided, how does it sort of influence how I think about your earnings power next year? And what caught my eye was the implied fourth quarter. You have an incremental EBITDA margin implied around 47%, which is actually a little lower than the 51% you just did. And I\u2019m just thinking about the incentive comp drag, I would think would be a little lower than we just went through.","Neff stand-alone comes in at higher EBITDA margins than 47%. And maybe most importantly, if we\u2019re thinking about 2018, it seems like the fourth quarter maybe the first time in, I don\u2019t know, two years, three years where your rate growth year-over-year could be as much or more than your fleet utilization growth, which historically is a positive mix for profitability. So can you help us understand why the incremental EBITDA margins will be worse in the fourth quarter than the third quarter?","William Plummer","Thank you, David. I\u2019ll start on that one. Regarding our bonus accrual, you\u2019re right. It shouldn\u2019t be as high as what it was in the third quarter. But I do remind you that we gave ranges. And the ranges, I would argue, if you look at the extreme of the ranges, it might be a little bit more normal in terms of the incrementals in Q4.","David Raso","Okay. So thinking after then to the 2018 thought process, the way you thought about CapEx and given what appears you\u2019re going to have some carryover from rate utilization, obviously, is also going to be healthy with -- especially in the hurricane areas in the fourth quarter. When you set up the framework for 2018 and it\u2019s framework, it\u2019s early, is next year a year where the framework is rate growth should be higher than your utilization growth? Just given how hot the utilization is and how we\u2019re exiting the year, I would think that would be base case. But just so I understand so again I think about the potential implications on incremental margins.","William Plummer","Sure. So I don\u2019t make a link between rate growth and utilization growth the way your question implies. What I would say separately is that our utilization growth has been pretty strong over the course of this year and actually going back into last year. And it\u2019s, in my view, not reasonable to expect that we\u2019re going to continue to deliver 160, 180 basis point improvement year-over-year forever and ever. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that year-over-year comparison come down a little bit in 2018. And so that\u2019s the way I would think about that.","Rate growth, we\u2019ve established momentum in the right direction, right? The question is how far can that go? And that\u2019s really going to be handed to us by the market as well as our execution. I feel confident that our execution and focus on rate is going to be good. Will the market continue to offer up the kind of year-over-year improvements that we started to see here? Time will tell. So those two components I think about separately. But I think in any case, both of them are set up nicely going into 2018. And we\u2019ll execute as best we can in 2018 to take advantage of what\u2019s there.","David Raso","And with this, just sort of clear, though, you\u2019re thinking separately, but fundamentally, rate provides a better incremental margin than utilization, correct?","William Plummer","Absolutely. We certainly want to get as much rate as we can and do it within the operational framework that allows us to deliver time utilization improvement, right? That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. The question is, is the market environment there that allows us to do it? If it is, I think we can deliver pretty effectively as you saw in Q3.","David Raso","All right. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup. Your question please.","Tim Thein","Great, thank you. And Bill, just to follow up on rates, can you update us in terms of where you are today in terms of repricing the NES contracts? It would -- at least, based on the pro forma you gave last night, it would appear that you did make further progress in terms of narrowing that spread. But just kind of want to get an update there as to where we sit today on harmonizing those contracts. And then just as related to that, where, based on the midpoint of your revenue guidance for 2017, what would the carryover impact be at the midpoint in 2018 on rates?","Matt Flannery","So Tim, this is Matt. I would say as far as NES contract harmonization, they didn\u2019t have a lot of fixed price business in NES. So that would be an area where you would actually technically go to the customer and harmonize any gap that would exist between the two.","We don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not really tracking, at this point, any NES stand-alone metrics. The business is so fully integrated right now, as Mike had mentioned in his opening, that the customers are seeing it all as one. And most of the pricing is spot pricing at this point. I will say that wherever there are gaps, they\u2019re all in one price zone right now. So you continue to see movement towards -- much closer towards United historical pricing. But we\u2019re also very cautious that these are relationships that we value and we paid a lot of money for, and we\u2019re going to maintain those relationships. So it\u2019s not directly answer your question, but I think directionally, you\u2019ll see in the rate results that we\u2019ve done a good job of creating a lesser gap.","William Plummer","Yes. And Tim, on carryover, I mean, you guys can all fill out a spreadsheet as well as we can and make your own assumptions about how the rest of this year finishes out. But if you make any reasonable assumptions, I think you\u2019re going to be a point of carryover, if not a little higher going into next year if this year finishes out with anything decent. So the backdrop is a good starting point, but that\u2019s not where we want to rest on our laurels, right? We want continue to try and manage the rate and do it in the context to what the markets offer.","Tim Thein","Okay thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your question please.","Rob Wertheimer","Thank you operator and good morning everybody. So you are effectively achieving record time utilization. And you guys have worked hard and getting rate also, which is lovely. You guys have worked hard on operational improvement. Can you see at a branch-by-branch or region-by-region level whether you can actually push time utilization higher than you might have thought two and three and four years ago, and therefore, you can get more out of less fleet? Or do you think you\u2019re actually at pretty good levels here and if the market\u2019s strong, you\u2019ll continue to add fleet to keep it at this level?","William Plummer","Yes, Rod. So we\u2019re certainly are at pretty good levels and considering we\u2019re at record levels. So we already enjoyed significant time use advantages over the industry benchmarks. I think that we ask our questions all the time is how high can we go? Density helps us with that, and I think that some of what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019ve grown to be a bigger company. Density and marketplace certainly gives us the opportunity to drive higher time than you could have in the past.","It\u2019d be difficult for me to say that we\u2019re going to beat the record year next year, but I guarantee you, that is our goal is to continue to push time use as high as possible.","Matt Flannery","Look at September, right, 73.6% utilization in the month of September. Imagining operating at that kind of level all year long, it\u2019s certainly something that would be great to see. But it\u2019s a real challenge, right? It\u2019s tiring to operate at that level. As we continue today, our lean initiatives and our focus on improving our operations are all about getting us more a capability of operating at higher levels of utilization. I think it\u2019s fair to say a few years ago the thought of being at 73.6% in September might have been intimidating to some people.","Well, we just did it, and so there\u2019s opportunity to do better. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do on a continual basis.","Rob Wertheimer","That is wonderful. Can I ask you a little bit of a more, same idea but a little bit more of a structural one? Can you see yet results from Total Control that go beyond anecdotal and served indicator or not that you can widen your competitive gap versus the industry and how you\u2019re able to provide better efficiency to your customers\u2019 utilization or otherwise? I mean, just maybe see if that is widening out on the data versus industry results.","Matt Flannery","Yeah absolutely Rob. Our penetration with our TC customers continues to grow. It\u2019s a big differentiator for those customers that value that tool. And we will continue to separate further by enhancements to those tools. Technologies moving quickly, and we have to keep up with it. If you think about just GPS alone, we have over 200,000 with GPS, telematics on it right now, and our goal is now 270,000 with the addition of the extra Neff and NES fleets. So we continue to fill out that value prop to our customers on technology, telematics, and TC is a big part of that.","Rob Wertheimer","Thanks, I will turn it over. Appreciated.","William Plummer","Thanks.","Matt Flannery","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","William Plummer","Hey Scott.","Scott Schneeberger","Good morning everyone. Two quick questions. I\u2019ll ask them both upfront. One, on the CapEx pull-forward, I understand that the storms in strong demand environment. Could you discuss is there any pricing benefit to that with OEMs since we\u2019re in that season and how we might think about that as a pricing perspective next year?","And then the second question is with the mention of the resumption of the share repurchase program, are we taking a step back here from the M&A pipeline? Just curious the implications of that. And if not, kind of areas you\u2019re looking at.","Michael Kneeland","Yeah Scott, I will take the second. I\u2019ll start with the second. And then, of course, Matt and Bill can jump in on the first one. But no, I think Bill outlined it, as we talked about a little bit of housekeeping. But we look at every acquisition on its own merits. The team has done a wonderful job of providing lots of dry powder for the company, and we\u2019re very disciplined about our approach. That will not change. I\u2019ve talked about it ad nauseam about how we think about strategic fit financial and cultural. And we will continue to look and see what those opportunities bring. We\u2019re not afraid to do an acquisition, and we\u2019re not afraid to pass on them either.","So I think the disciplined approach that we\u2019ve had has yielded great benefits. And you\u2019re seeing that in some of our results. As far as the first question, I\u2019ll pass it over to Matt.","Matt Flannery","Sure, so we most of the fleet that we buy are from strategic partners that we set up on an annual basis. And we don\u2019t leverage them in a last-minute order, and they don\u2019t leverage us when things are tight. So there\u2019s really no movement there in pricing. These are more important longer-term relationships that we have with our vendors, and we\u2019re very pleased with the way we\u2019re treated.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much guys.","William Plummer","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc. Your question please.","Joe Box","Hey good morning guys. So maybe just to dovetail off of Scott\u2019s question. I mean, it seems like utilization is pretty tight across the entire space right now. Curious to your sense for maybe the industry\u2019s appetite to grow fleet. And then related to that, is there any risk right now that the OEMs actually can\u2019t deliver on your $200 million CapEx increase?","Matt Flannery","So Joe, we \u2013 no, we have POs aligned, slots aligned we got everything we need to execute on that. If the demand remains, we\u2019ll go all the way up to that $200 million. If not, it\u2019ll be towards the 70 50. But we\u2019re all dialed in with as far as slots and deliverables from the OEMs.","Michael Kneeland","The market dynamic will be the market dynamic. We don\u2019t know what the competition will do or not. We are myopically focused on our customers and the value proposition that we can bring, but we\u2019re cognizant of it. We watch it. And again, we are very disciplined around our capital spend.","Joe Box","So maybe just a follow-up. I\u2019m just trying to understand some of the moving pieces for CapEx and free cash flow for next year. Certainly, not asking for guidance, but directionally, how should we be thinking about total replacement need here? Obviously you guys have added Neff, which probably need some replacement. And then are we thinking more or less replacement needed as we started to climb out of maybe the lack of purchases from 2009 to 2011.","William Plummer","Yes. So Joe, regards replacement, if you think about it as the legacy United business needing to replace, we\u2019ve been selling something like $1 billion of OEC before the NES deal. So that continued with a little bit of growth, plus you add a need for replacing, let\u2019s say, 100 each for NES and Neff, just to use round numbers, that gets you up to $1.2 billion kind of replacement spend on an OEC basis. And obviously, the inflation impact there, you have to add in, right? Because you\u2019ve got every unit that you buy today replaces a 7, 8-year-old unit at 15% lower price.","So you add 15% on top of that, you\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion kind of replacement need out of your CapEx next year. So that\u2019s a rough starting point. And then we\u2019ll debate, of course, growth on top of that, and that will get us to a 2018 CapEx number. We\u2019re going through that process right now, our budgeting process. So clearly, we haven\u2019t decided on the final number. But in terms of replacement spend, that\u2019s the logic that\u2019s pretty good starting point.","Joe Box","That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Hey good morning guys. I wanted to ask you guys just a couple of macro questions. Just first on interest rates in general. I mean, we\u2019ve obviously been in this low interest rate environment seemingly forever now. What happens to the business in the rental industry if we get a spike in interest rates? How should we think about your position versus some of the smaller players and so forth and just the overall growth dynamics?","William Plummer","So we\u2019ve always said it depends on what caused the spike in interest rates, right? I mean, obviously, the cost of interest goes up, but if the spike is driven by incremental economic activities across the economy, then in construction, you would expect the benefit from that. And so the net-net impact might be positive associated with a spike in interest expense. As it relates to sort of the competitive position of us versus the rest of the rental industry, well, I certainly feel great about the position that we\u2019re in, right? We\u2019ve got a very low level of floating interest in our overall debt structure. And so we would feel an impact, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say it might be less of an impact than some of our competitors. And so that should put us in a little bit more advantage position in terms of financial performance.","Could it stress some of our competitors to the point of them impacting the actions they take in the marketplace? I guess, it could, but it depends on the individual competitor that you\u2019re talking about.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, thanks Will it is helpful. And then do you think the repricing on NES and I imagine you\u2019re going to go through some of that with Neff as well, do you think the repricing of the contracts because they\u2019re pretty big players in the grand scheme of things after you and Sunbelt, I mean, is that contributing to the general pricing environment that we\u2019re seeing in the market?","Matt Flannery","Ross, this is Matt. There are some contribution to it, right, from NES. Neff, we\u2019re pretty aligned across the board about our pricing, our pricing methodology and the culture around pricing. But with NES, we got a little bit of lift from that. I think more importantly even in our non-NES overlap markets. We have seen similar pricing increases. So although it\u2019s not a driver for the macro, it is certainly a couple of bps improvement over the normal.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks guys.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question please.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi good morning. First just thinking about some of the EBITDA lifts next year related to Neff and NES. Could you talk about what\u2019s remaining on the stub portion there just with some of the seasonality that we could see in 4Q or 1Q and stuff that wasn\u2019t captured with them. What your thinking as we roll into 2018 on that? And then any additional contribution on some of the realized synergy savings.","William Plummer","Joe, it\u2019s Bill. I\u2019m going to have to ask you the question again. I\u2019m missing your question.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Sorry. So really just looking at the tailwinds to EBITDA from Neff and NES, as you get full realization of those next year and then on top of that, you get some cost synergies?","William Plummer","So I think if your question is about sort of the full year effect next year of adding NES and Neff, we\u2019ll have an extra quarter of NES next year. This year, that number was about $30 million. So that could be a good starting point. So call it $30 million of impact from adding a quarter of NES. For Neff, call it $150 million for adding the three quarters that we didn\u2019t own it next year. And then the synergies for NES, I called out north of $20 million of synergies realized this year. If you had a 45 run rate, you call it 25 realized this year, that nets out to an incremental 20 year-over-year. So that\u2019s a benefit next year.","For Neff synergies, let\u2019s \u2013 you can pick your own number, right? We said 35 of synergies fully realized at the end of two years, I think, it was. So $25 million, $30 million of synergies realized during the course of next year. You pick [Audio Dip] that\u2019s an impact there that we might see. Is that helpful?","Joe O\u2019Dea","That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. And then just in the press release, it noted fourth quarter market activity would exceed normal seasonality. And just any additional context on that. In particular, how do we think about if there is such a thing as normal seasonality for rates and based on EBITDA margin that\u2019s implied, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re suggesting better-than-normal rate experience?","Matt Flannery","Yes, Joe. This is Matt. I think that was more referring to demand and partially an explanation of why you saw an increase in the capital spend ranges. We normally wouldn\u2019t spend that much in a Q4, so we thought it noted an explanation. But that demand is there, and it\u2019s not all just storm-related. As far as rate, I mean, we\u2019re going to always push to do more, but we all understand the seasonal patterns of rate, and all of this is embedded in the guidance that we just updated.","Joe O\u2019Dea","And can you add anything just on the months? I mean, normally, sequentially, I think we\u2019d still see growth in October, maybe a little bit November, December, sometimes under a little bit of pressure. Anything that you could do in terms of adding numbers to that?","William Plummer","Yes. Normally, the normal \u2013 what\u2019s normal but if you go back over an overview as you would see a positive October. November can go either way, depending on the year that you\u2019re in, and December typically would be a slight negative. But how much on each of those is always the challenge, right? So I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Matt Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","William Plummer","Hi, Seth?","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning guys. Hi good morning.","Matt Flannery","Hi, Seth.","Seth Weber","So just going back to the CapEx pull-forward question. Is it safe to assume that most of that is tilted towards Gen Rent versus specialty? And I guess, the spirit of my question is if you look at dollar utilization for the quarter, it was actually down for booms and lifts and forklifts as well year-over-year. So I mean, earthmoving was up. So can you give us any flavor for where that incremental CapEx was going and maybe any color on why dollar","Matt Flannery","Sure, Seth. Well, first, I think you\u2019ll have to remember, if you\u2019re looking on a year-over-year basis, we did \u2013 you\u2019re looking at a comp that didn\u2019t have the NES boom business in it and then does in Q3 this year. So that was a little bit of drag on the age that we\u2019ve been moving down and a little bit of a drag on the dollar but which will continue to improve that spread as well.","As far as the pull-forward spend, it looks very much like what our normal spend would be, maybe a little more heavily weighted on specialty. Because some of the immediate response that we needed and a little less on booms and reach forks for the same exact reason we have more of those around. So other than that, it looks similar to our profile. Almost all of it core fleet and very fungible assets.","Seth Weber","Okay. So more on specialty, Matt, is that what you said?","Matt Flannery","Yes, a little bit more on specialty just because some of the remediation, some of the power. And we might even got some more pumps, as busy as pump was to help.","Seth Weber","Okay. That\u2019s great. And then maybe, Bill, just a quick follow-up on Project XL. Appreciate the disclosure of the 10 \u2013 I think it was $10 million or $11 million from that one initiative on the used sales. But can you just give us an update kind of where you\u2019re at? And we\u2019re getting close to needing to have some sort of line of sight to that $200 million number. Can you help us frame out the steps to get \u2013 how should we think about the cadence to get to that $200 million run rate number versus where we\u2019re at today?","William Plummer","Sure, Seth. So we\u2019ve discussed this every quarter since we\u2019ve talked about Project XL. And we debated about the best way to tell the story in a way that\u2019s useful, right? And the way that\u2019s useful is what\u2019s the incremental impact on our profitability, right? And the challenge that we have \u2013 and I\u2019m giving you a background here, but the challenge that we have is that the individual projects each have their own set of metrics. And those metrics may not necessarily directly tied to an incremental EBITDA impact.","And so we\u2019re looking at ways, various ways to try and back out the things that you shouldn\u2019t count as incremental EBITDA. That\u2019s a long-winded way of saying that I don\u2019t have a specific number for you right here now on the incremental EBITDA impact of each of those projects. What we\u2019ve tried to do is to pick out the ones where we feel like there\u2019s clarity around the incremental EBITDA impact. So obviously, improving the utilization of equipment versus fair market value is true cash flow impact.","And so we wanted to show that, wanted to show a little bit more of what we\u2019re doing. But I\u2019ll ask for further patience as we try to look for the best way to give you what you\u2019re asking for, which is more concrete pacing about how we\u2019re getting to the $200 million impact.","Seth Weber","But is it fair to assume that 2018 is going to be a bigger benefit versus 2017 just to \u2013 as you ramp to that $200 million number? I mean, that seems like a reasonable assumption.","William Plummer","Absolutely. That\u2019s fair. The exact quantification of that is what we want to put some more thought to. But what I can say is this, Seth. As we look at how the projects, in aggregate, are tracking versus the targets that were laid out when we kicked off Project XL, we\u2019re performing very nicely against those targets. So the ramp-up on the metrics at each initiative uses is, in aggregate, nicely ahead of the targets that we\u2019ve laid out. But we want to \u2013 when we communicate something out, we want to make sure that it\u2019s useful and clear.","And right now, there\u2019s just too much analysis and discussion we would have to give in order to relate the measures that we have to the $200 million run rate that we\u2019re targeting. So we\u2019ll ask you again for your patience.","Seth Weber","Okay. I\u2019ll ask you again next quarter then.","William Plummer","I\u2019m sure, you will.","Michael Kneeland","By then, it should be embedded in our guidance.","Seth Weber","All right, thanks guys.","William Plummer","Thanks Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","William Plummer","Steve?","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Steven Fisher","I know you guys said that you don\u2019t know what the market\u2019s going to do in terms of CapEx going forward, but to what extent are you actually seeing some discipline and restraint in the market today? And if you are seeing some general discipline, is it more on the pricing side or on the CapEx side? And I\u2019m wondering if given the robustness of the conditions that you\u2019re seeing out there if you would have ordinarily expected to see other players already putting more CapEx into the environment where we are.","Matt Flannery","Steve, this is Matt. I would say that we\u2019re seeing both \u2013 we are seeing discipline. We measure it by absorption, and we\u2019ve been seeing that for the entire year, really starting fourth quarter last year that the discipline on the capital spend versus the incremental demand has yielded positive absorption. And we think that\u2019s played out into stabilizing rate and given us the opportunity to get pricing where it was pre-2015. So I would think that the industry has been disciplined on both fronts.","Steven Fisher","Is consolidation having any real impact there? And what else do you think is driving it?","William Plummer","Yes. That\u2019s a hard one to quantify. I would say sort of based on basic economics that consolidation could be helping. How much? It\u2019s hard to say. What we try to do, though, is just to make sure that we\u2019re looking at the market realistically and we\u2019re taking actions in a disciplined way. And if we continue to do that and if the rest of the industry continues to do that, we certainly think that it should position the industry to perform better.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then can you just remind us the timing of repricing of all your National Account contracts? And if it\u2019s around the next couple of months, what extent would this quarter\u2019s results set you up for stronger pricing as you head into those discussion?","Matt Flannery","So it\u2019s not really on a calendar schedule anymore, Steve. We actually intentionally try to address those throughout the cycle. It makes it easier for our team and with the acquisitions that was just some triggers that actually made it necessary to harmonize some set pricing at different times. So there\u2019s not really an annual trigger like maybe four, five years ago where we\u2019re doing everything in Q4 and Q1. It\u2019s a little more spread out.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. Our third quarter investor presentations are available online if you haven\u2019t had a chance to see it. Obviously, you can reach out to Ted Grace, our Head of IR, with any additional questions. It\u2019s been a busy year, and we\u2019re looking forward to starting 2018 with a lot of momentum, so stay tuned for our next call. Thank you, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome today. With me today, as the operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officers; and other members of our senior management team.","Now you may have noticed that we reported our results yesterday prior to the market close. That's because our release was inadvertently made available to employees at that time. So we made the prudent decision to distribute our release publicly.","Now as you saw, we turned in some strong results, particularly in terms of margin. Historically, the third quarter is our most robust period, and that was true in 2012 and it was true again this year when our rental revenues increased by more than 8%. But more importantly, our results as a whole reflect 2 dynamics that are essential to our strategy.","First, our nonresidential construction spending is recovering, although the pace is still very modest. And the bulk of the upswing is expected to come in 2014 and 2015. But demand is definitely improving, and we're getting a benefit from that. And the second, the quarter reflects our ability to generate significant value even from a small improvement in our operating environment. Remember, it was only a few years ago that we had the goal of adjusted EBITDA at only 40% margin, and this is the sixth straight quarter that we've exceeded that percentage. Now, obviously, our sights are set higher, but our objective remains the same, and that is to create value by improving our margins and driving better returns.","Now Bill will discuss our performance in more detail in a few minutes, and then after that, we can go to the Q&A. But before I move on, I want to mention the share repurchase program we announced last night. Our Board of Directors has authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases, which we expect to execute over the next 18 months. Now this was carefully considered use of cash, and it's consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes balancing organic growth while maintaining leverage within the target range of 2.5 to 3.5x over the cycle and returning cash to shareholders, while at the same time remaining our flexibility to do M&A. Now if you have any questions about that program, we'll address those as well during the Q&A. So let's move on to the quarter.","As you saw last night, our adjusted EBITDA was $642 million, and our margin was a record 49%. Now that's $72 million increase compared to our third quarter last year, and that puts us just over $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA through September. We reaffirmed our outlook for adjusted EBITDA between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion this year, and we have good reasons to be confident about that target.","Now first, as I mentioned, there's no question that we're seeing more demand from our services. And while the upswing is modest compared to what we think we'll see next year, it has given us enough traction to grow the business. But there's more than just the construction recovery behind our revenue improvement, and we're executing our strategy extremely well in this environment. And you can see it in the components of our revenue increase year-over-year.","For the third quarter, we drove an 8.2% increase in volume in our rent, a 3.2% increase in rental rates; and time utilization of 70.8%, and that's 100 basis points higher than last year. As I said many times, it's always a balancing act between rates and utilization. And you can see it in the third quarter that we had solid improvement in rates and an exceptional level of utilization, and still, our rates are on a good trajectory. In fact, rates were up overall in every major category in the quarter year-over-year. And on a sequential basis, rates trended up each month versus last year, and we're standing behind our outlook for full year rate increase of at least 4%. Now I want to emphasize that we're never complacent about rate improvements at any level. Our mindset is that we can always do better, and you'll see us continue to push for rate in 2014 and beyond.","We're also maintaining a tight cost discipline and continuing to harvest synergies from the merger with RSC. We realized $64 million of synergies in the quarter, and we expect to meet our goal of $230 million to $250 million in annual synergies.","Now turning to the marketplace. One of the hallmarks of a genuine recovery's nonresidential construction is in its footprint. And that's in between [ph] a regional fluctuation to a true turnaround. In the third quarter, all but one of our regions showed growth in rental revenues, with 8 regions showing double-digit improvement. It's also encouraging that growth comes from a mix of projects, not just 1 sector. In the Mountain West, for example, we have machines on-site at a football stadium, a university expansion, an airport expansion and a new health care facility under construction. And we're also servicing in oil, projects in oil, gas, mining, distribution and solar, and that's all within 1 region. So organic growth was a major factor in our quarter, but we also expanded our specialty network, with an eye towards driving returns in future periods.","In August, we announced the opening of greenfield locations in San Diego, in Oklahoma City and in Fort McMurray, Alberta, and these were all Power HVAC branches. Our specialty operations reported an impressive year-over-year growth of nearly 25% for the quarter, and 19% of that was same-store growth. So we're doing a good job of cross-selling our services and building a reputation as a single-source provider.","Now all of our growth initiatives are carefully calculated to give us near-term and long-term results. This applies to our M&A activity, like our acquisition of Rent World in August, as well as new branch openings, sales force expansion, investments in technology and a whole range of other options at our disposal. It also applies to our CapEx. We treat our CapEx like any other growth initiative, and we allocate our cash, what would drive results and attractive return.","Now through the first 9 months of this year, we spent just under $1.5 billion on new equipment rental. That puts us on a path to spend $1.6 billion in total. We're investing in equipment that we know that our customers need, and we're constantly always fine-tuning that mix.","Our salespeople also do an excellent job of reading the local markets, and the money we spent on the fleet in April, May and June helped drive our numbers in the third quarter. We saw key account revenue increase by 7%, and unassigned accounts, which tend to be local customers, had revenue growth of 10.5% in the quarter. And that's good progress because as you know from our last call, these smaller accounts were the most challenging to retain during the integration.","So our end markets are percolating, and we think they'll heat up significantly in 2014. That's also the view of many forecasters in our industry. And 2015 is expected to be even stronger, particularly for commercial construction.","So in terms of the coming year, we'll talk more about that on the next call. But in the meantime, you'll see us continue to focus on controllable elements of our business and execute our strategy with diligence and discipline. We have a good visibility through December, and all indications are that we'll continue to show year-over-year improvement.","Now before I close, I want to share a personal experience I had earlier this week. I had the honor of speaking at the International Rental Conference in Beijing, China, which is still very much an emerging market for rental. Their industry is facing the same challenges right now, but the energy at the rental conference was absolutely electric. Rental operators in China can see the future, and they can't wait to carve out a new industry, just as we did in North America in the '70s and '80s. While our focus remains on North America in the short term, we have the same passion for taking the business in new directions. We're the architects of our own success, and we've worked hard to bring the business to this point. And it's no accident that we find ourselves in a position to expand our fleet, delever our balance sheet and return cash to investors while pursuing numerous avenues for growth. In short, we're going to go into 2014 with every opportunity on the table.","So with that, I'll turn to Bill -- over to Bill for the financial results. So over to you, Bill.","William B. Plummer","Well, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Mike hit the highlights of the quarter, so I'll try to add a little bit of color as I go through the financial results and then touch briefly on the outlook for 2013 and the share repurchase programs.","In terms of the financial results for the quarter, as Mike said, it was a strong one within rental -- within revenue. We had a very robust rental revenue growth, up 3.8% in the quarter. You all know that rental revenue is composed of our own equipment revenue, plus re-rent revenue, plus ancillary and other revenues. In this quarter, owned equipment revenue was about 87% of the total rental revenue. And OER was up 8%. Obviously, OER is driven by our rate performance. As Mike said, it was -- the rates were up 3.2%, also driven by our volume performance. Volume was up 8.2% in the quarter. The difference between those 2 added together and the 8% OER growth was mix and other factors. Within that, mix and other inflation made up a negative 2%, and the remainder was a negative 1.3% that we point to as mix. So those were the important drivers of rental revenue. We did have a good quarter in ancillary and -- that offset a little bit of headwind in re-rent. You all know that we've been displacing re-rents with owned equipment since the merger, so we expect to see a little bit of a headwind in re-rent. So put all that together, and that explains the 8.3% improvement in rental revenue for the quarter, overall.","I'll offer a little bit more on the volume performance in that quarter. Volume was very robust, up 8.2% in the quarter, as I said. We had OEC-on-Rent of $5.6 billion in the quarter. That's a record OEC-on-Rent quarter for us by quite a margin. To be able to have that size fleet out on rent, growing 8%-plus in the quarter on top of the increase and the size of our fleet overall, I think, makes a very strong statement about demand in the marketplace.","Mike mentioned that the time utilization in our fleet was 70.8% in the quarter, up 100 basis points over last year. And again, that's a very robust level of time utilization for the size fleet that we have. So a really good quarter in terms of the level of demand and our ability to satisfy that demand, and we feel good about the momentum that we've carried into the fourth quarter in terms of our rental revenue.","I'll touch briefly on used equipment sales, another good strong quarter for us in used. We had $102 million of used proceeds in the quarter, and those revenues came at a 48% adjusted gross margin, a very robust margin result for us as well. A big driver, which has been the case for the last several quarters, is the shift in the channel mix. Our retail channel just contributes more and more every quarter. Retail sales this quarter represented 62.6% of all of our used equipment sales, and that's 9 percentage points more through the retail channel than last year. So that strong retail channel mix, along with what is still a very robust pricing environment for used equipment, contributed to that 48% adjusted gross margin in the quarter on used. So used continues to contribute nicely to our results, and we look to continue that going forward as well.","Let me turn to profitability at EBITDA. Mike mentioned $462 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the 49% EBITDA margin. I guess that's a little repetitive, but it's fun to say. So I'll say it again, 49% EBITDA margin. All right, thanks. That was for me. And that was an improvement, a nice improvement over the prior year, $72 million of improved EBITDA performance over the prior year or 220 basis points in margin improvement.","To bridge that $72 million year-over-year EBITDA change, I would break it out as follows: the 3.2% rental rate increase flows through to an EBITDA impact of $27 million in the quarter. That increase in OEC-on-Rent, the 8.2% volume increase that I mentioned, flows through at $48 million of volume impact to EBITDA. We had a year-over-year improvement in our synergy results. We delivered $64 million of synergy in the quarter. That compares to $45 million last year, so $19 million of improved synergy results in the quarter. Used sales contributed $8 million more in gross profit for the quarter. We had a particularly nice bad debt expense result in the quarter of $5 million improvement compared to last year. And so those were all of the positives that we had in that $72 million year-over-year impact working against those fleet inflation. We started talking about that last quarter a little bit more explicitly. If you take the impact of the fleet that we sold as used through the quarter, we sold $189 million of OEC in the quarter. That fleet -- replacing that fleet at current prices had an impact at EBITDA of about $12 million unfavorable.","Along with that, we had an impact of a couple of other items. Delivery expense was a little higher in the quarter, unfavorable by $8 million. That's really driven partly by timing of expense invoices year-over-year but also most strongly by the fact that we've now improved the deliveries per driver within our system very effectively to the point where we have to use a little bit more outside hauling. And so that was the main contributor to that $8 million unfavorability in delivery expense.","We talked previously about merit increases. They took effect early in the year. The impact in the quarter was an unfavorable $5 million in the quarter. And everything else lumped together, we'll call mix and others, was an unfavorable $10 million in the quarter. So those were the key pieces to the total $72 million year-over-year improvement that we had in EBITDA.","If you take that $72 million against the total revenue changes that we had, the flow-through to adjusted EBITDA this quarter was 78.3% in total, and obviously, that includes the $19 million of year-over-year improvement in synergies. If you exclude the synergy impact, our flow-through was a little north of 58% in the quarter, excluding synergies. And that's putting us in line to deliver a flow-through, x synergy, for the full year that's going to be about 60%.","At EPS, you all saw the results there, adjusted EPS of $1.63 for the quarter, a very strong quarter for us and, obviously, a very nice improvement at EPS over last year.","Moving on to free cash flow, just really briefly. Our year-to-date free cash flow usage is $84 million, and that includes the effect of our CapEx spend. As Mike said, we spent year-to-date just under $1.5 billion of gross CapEx. I'll remind you that when we talk about free cash flow, typically, we talk about it excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, just to get a clear view of how the underlying company is performing. We called it out in the press release of those expenses being $33 million in the quarter. And so I'd just remind everyone that you'd have to take that off the minus $84 million to think about the full year free cash flow the way that we think about it on a go-forward basis.","I think that's all I'll say on the free cash flow. Real briefly on our outlook. Mike mentioned that we've reaffirmed our outlook, in particular, total revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion; free cash flow between $400 million and $500 million for the full year. We certainly feel that those ranges are appropriate. If you pressed a little harder, given the challenge that we've addressed with rental rate performance, it's more likely that will come in the lower half of those ranges, but the length -- the ranges are still effective at this point.","In terms of the share repurchase program, again, Mike touched on that briefly, but the $500 million program, we think, is very consistent with our philosophy and approach around how we deploy the cash flow that we expect to generate over the next several years. In particular, it's fully consistent with what we've said about our desire to manage leverage to a lower level for our company. We still see leverage between 2.5x and 3.5x as being appropriate over the cycle, and we continue to expect to reduce our leverage as we go forward over the next several years, even as we execute the share repurchase program.","That program, we expect to start executing against immediately, again, with the intent of getting it completed within 18 months. We expect to use open market purchases primarily to execute the repurchases, although we do preserve flexibility to do something in the way of an accelerated repurchase, if we think that's appropriate. But we like the flexibility that an open market program brings to us to manage all of the demands on our cash flow. The ABL will be the main source of financing for the repurchases, as we have done in our prior repurchase programs. And we feel that we're very well-positioned overall to execute this program and still be able to manage the business in the way that we think is appropriate.","So those are the key comments that I'd offer. At this point, I'll turn it back to the operator and ask you to open up the phones for question and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess on the reaffirmed rate guidance, 4%-plus for the year, to me, it seems like that implies some improvement in the fourth quarter, north of what the 3.2% that you did here in the third quarter, maybe something in the mid to upper 3% range year-over-year. Can you give us your confidence -- what gives you confidence in hitting that kind of number? Any color on what trends you're seeing in October and maybe what that implies for a rollover into -- to start 2014?","William B. Plummer","Hey, Seth, it's Bill. I'll start. And, Matt, feel free to chime in as well. I think you're right. The implication mathematically is that we'll do better than the 3.2% year-over-year in fourth quarter. While we haven't given any more specific guidance than that, I think what we would say is that you -- if you look at the sequentials that we need in order to deliver at least 4% for the full year, the sequentials in the last 3 months of the year, they average out something maybe just a little shy of 0.5%. And we think that's very reasonable. And in fact, if you look at what we've experienced so far in October, it sets us up very nicely to deliver the month of October, and we feel very good about November and December on a sequential basis. So if we do what we think we can do and what we've done historically in the fourth quarter, we should be pretty good at hitting that at least 4% rate guidance. Matt, anything you want to add to it?","Matthew J. Flannery","No, I think Bill's touched on it. And we'll continue to see October and November sequentially improve, as we historically do.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And what would that translate to, to start the year, do you think? Is that like a 2% or low 2% range to start next year?","William B. Plummer","Yes. It'd be about 2% carryover, Seth.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And if you're doing that kind of rate, mid- to high-3s in the fourth quarter and something like that maybe next year, can you still do a 60% or 70% pull-through margin on that kind of rate gain?","William B. Plummer","Yes, we can -- what we'd say is we'll be about 60% for the full year based on our forecast for the fourth quarter. So all of that's consistent with the flow-through about 60% in Q4. And as you look to next year, we view our base business as being a flow-through normally in that 60% to 70% range. So I'd probably say about 60% for next year as well. Obviously, we have to refine and finalize our planning process for next year, but that's the neighborhood that I think we'd be comfortable with.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Michael and Matt, I'm wondering if you can talk about, from the Total Control penetration that you've been able to achieve so far, what's the dollar impact you're seeing on your business, whether it's customer retention or lower cost of service to customer, and just frame for us where do you think Total Control can ultimately go as a proportion of your business? And then, obviously, nice progress on RSC synergies. Can you just talk about what are the next levers you're pulling to get to the multi-year synergy targets, since you've already hit your 2014 targets effectively this quarter?","Matthew J. Flannery","Sure, Jerry. As far as your first point on Total Control, as you could see on Slide 17 of the investor deck, we've had a $28 million improvement, a 27% improvement over this time -- over Q3 last year. And we're going to continue cross-selling to new customers within the portfolio. We had over 200 prospective Total Control members at our conference that we had in Orlando last month. This is an annual conference we get to introduce the Total Control offering to existing customers, to help us enhance it, as well as bring in new opportunities. So we feel very comfortable that we'll continue to penetrate more customers with this value-added tool. As far as the synergies, as you recognize, we'll reach our $230 million to $250 million range by year-end as opposed to having to wait until 2015. And we'll continue to look for more opportunities in productivity basically in shop and driver turnarounds. And we have an ongoing lean process that we're going through to help capture some of those opportunities. So we feel very good about that and even better that we're a year ahead of schedule on achieving that $230 million to $250 million range.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yes, Jerry, I would only go back to the 1 comment on Total Control that Matt talked about in Orlando. We announced that we've got a whole new mobile app that we are rolling out to our current members who are signed up with it, and it has a very robust capability, as well as some GPS additions. So that gives them, really, more opportunity to manage their consumption. And so it was very well-received amongst the audience, not only current customers but, more importantly, potential customers who are looking at the valued proposition around Total Control.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the rate that you're seeing the marketplace, can you just give us a sense what's the difference in rate increase you're seeing on the spot market basis versus your monthly business? Is there a difference in what's being put through currently?","Matthew J. Flannery","There's not a significant difference in the period mix, the day, week and month rate improvement. It's consistent with what we've been achieving over the last couple of years, and we don't really expect to see much variation in that either.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, Matt. Just to clarify, you're seeing the same rate increases on a spot basis that you're seeing on your longer-term business?","Matthew J. Flannery","Obviously, the contractual, if you look at a month by month by month, is a little more stable. But as far as against our goals and against our previous achievement, we're not seeing fluctuation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm just wondering if we could talk about the macro. I mean, if you look at nonres this year, at least on government data, it's been a little slower than expected. You guys have put up some nice volume growth. You've grown the fleet. Time utilization has been strong. Can you just talk about kind of like how you think the markets evolve year-to-date? What's your outlook in kind of the customer surveys and kind of how you think you're setting up for '14 and '15? Maybe some specificity about where you think things will accelerate or where you're most optimistic.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yes. This is Mike. Let me just kind of walk you through the progression analysis that sets up where -- how you can take a look at the improvement in what we're seeing, what gives us confidence. Everyone on the call realizes that one of the leading indicators is the ABI index, and we've all been watching that every month as it comes forward. Year-to-date, there's only been 1 month that was negative in our space. When you go back to 2012, we had 3 negative months in that same period. '11, we had 4, and '10, we had 8. So you can see the reduction that you're seeing a negative in most of them, all with the exception of 1 month this year, we saw a positive growth component in that arena. Step back and take a look at residential construction. Residential construction continues to improve, and that's usually another leading indicator. Roughly, around 18 months after residential starts to improve, you'll start to see nonres improvement. Those correlations have been very well-documented in historical recessions. Our customers continue to be very optimistic. 63 of our respondents in Q3 expect growth in the next 12 months. So it continues to improve. And when you take a look and step away and look at the whole macro from the ARA metric, according to Global Insight, they're expecting an 8% growth in 2014 for our industry and a 10% growth in our -- in the rental industry in 2015. So you take that all together, coupled with the fact that Bill, myself and Matt, particularly, Matt spends a lot of time in the field, we were at the QBRs, the quarterly business reviews, very optimistic at the management level as well.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful, Mike. And just in terms of thinking about the fleet size, could you just give us some handholding on how you'd encourage us to think about what you'll do with the fleet in '14 to capitalize on that in terms of growth and where we should look for focus? I mean, there's no doubt you guys have incrementally tilted towards specialty, and it should be great to get your perspective on how we should think about CapEx next year and in the context of specialty rental.","William B. Plummer","Sure, Ted. I think it's fair to say, next year, we expect, with the improving level of demand in the overall macro environment, to spend a little bit more on fleet than we did this year, all right? So instead of $1.6 billion, we're thinking a touch more, a touch might be an extra $100 million, in the $1.7 billion area. And obviously, we'll flex if we see the demand ramp up significantly or ramp down significantly. But that's the framing thought right now. A significant portion of that level of spend or that incremental spend is being driven by growth in our specialty area. Trench, Power & HVAC are opening new branches, as we've talked, and really penetrating the market more effectively. So we want to support that without starving the rest of our gen rent business. And so that's the framing thought process. I don't know, Matt or Mike, if you guys want to add anything about where else we might emphasize the spend.","Matthew J. Flannery","Well, I would just reiterate, with the specialty business, the high return products, and not only that, but a unique product offering in our space, we've grown our specialty products at 3x the rate that we've grown our overall fleet. So that's -- we'll continue to see that trend throughout '14.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And the last thing before I jump back in queue. But in terms of just cadence, if we were to go back and look at normal seasonality of CapEx patterns, should we at least be thinking that, that repeats or is there any unusual flows that we should be thinking about?","William B. Plummer","Yes, I think a normal cadence of quarters is probably the way to think about it. As we planned, obviously, it'll depend on our planning process, which we're in the middle of as we speak. But I think if you look back historically, a more normal cadence is where you should start thinking about 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","About funding the debt reduction and the share repo, just looking at some of your leverage targets. The fourth quarter cash flow, which is implied around $500 million, can you give us some feel for how you're thinking about debt reduction and free cash flow for repo in the fourth quarter?","William B. Plummer","Sure, David. So I will remind you that we gave a range for free cash flow of between $400 million and $500 million. And our view is that between payments against our accounts receivable and the timing of the remaining payables that we have against our CapEx purchases, that we expect a pretty robust fourth quarter of cash coming in. And we'll monitor that as we go through the quarter. We've been more effective at collections against our receivables over the course of the last year or so, and that puts us in a pretty good position to have a very robust payment stream coming in, in the fourth quarter to get us to that free cash flow number. We will -- obviously, as we think about executing the share repurchase throughout the fourth quarter, we will be very mindful of how the cash is flowing in, in the fourth quarter. And we'll meter the share repurchase activities that we do to make sure that it fits with our goal of coming in at about 3x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year. If we're doing some share repurchases, obviously, that puts a little upward pressure on that. But if it's 3.1 or even 3.2, please don't call me a liar for saying about 3. That's the way we think, that will firmly keep us on the path of reducing leverage over the next several years and we'll continue to manage it with an outlook toward achieving that while we execute the repurchase and fund the overall needs of the business. Does that help?","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's helpful. I mean, obviously, we're trying to figure out, can you fund both? And what's the priority? And we're talking through 2014. And between -- you talked about leverage, you're talking total debt, right, not net debt, correct? So I'm clearly doing the math properly?","William B. Plummer","Yes, that's the way we usually talk about it. I mean, there's not a lot of cash, so $120 million or so of cash relative to $7 billion of debt or so is not going to make a big difference. But yes, total debt is usually the way we think about it.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Because, I mean, the thing is, let's say, the EBITDA this year is a little below the midpoint, $2.275 billion, for example. To get that to the $3 billion leverage, that means you have to end the year with total debt, about $6.8 billion, $6.9 billion. You ended the third quarter nearly at $7.6 billion, right? And so to get this debt down to the appropriate level, to hit your target, it's going to imply all the free cash flow in the fourth quarter is going toward debt reduction. So I'm just trying to figure, is that the priority? Should I expect almost all the free cash flow in the fourth quarter is going to debt reduction then?","William B. Plummer","Yes, I mean, again, we'll manage it with debt reduction currently in mind. And so I think that's a backhanded way of saying, \"Don't look for $100 million worth of share repurchase in the quarter.\" I think we'll manage the share repurchase to make sure that we stay on that path of leverage reduction.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then thinking about those targeted $2.5 billion leverage by the end of next year, what that can be implying about the EBITDA for next year. The cash flow for next year, you put out a target for 3 years cumulative of $1.5 billion, right? This year, you'd do $450 million, right? That means we have a little more than $1.15 billion the next 2 years. Let me just take the average of that. You say next year free cash flow is about $625 million, let me just keep it simple, $600 million. To fund the share repo next year, $500 million, it doesn't leave a lot for debt reduction next year. So I'm just trying to think, are you feeling that confident about the EBITDA number that you can pay off very little debt next year to fund the repo and still hit your target of $2.5 billion? Because if you did, it would imply an EBITDA next year of $2.65 billion, $2.7 billion, a pretty large number. I just want to make sure you're not -- that's what the math is telling us. I just want to make sure, what are you implying, that high EBITDA or that be careful on assuming we can do the repo at $500 million during the course of next year and still get the target to $2.5 billion on the leverage?","William B. Plummer","So without addressing the specific numbers, what I'd say is that we purposely chose the size and the timing of our share repurchase and purposely chose the statements that we make about the leverage so that we can make them all work together. So 18 months is the time that we said we would execute the share repurchase over, and that's not a statement that we do all $500 million during calendar 2014. And we'll continue to focus on managing and balancing how much we do of any of this so that we can continue to delever. That's an important priority for us, and we're going to manage with that objective firmly in mind. And we feel confident that we can do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bill, I guess this is a good follow-up then. Perhaps if you can outline your thoughts around refinancing high coupon debt. What are you thinking in terms of timing strategy around that?","William B. Plummer","Sure, Manish. We monitor the higher coupon issues on almost a daily basis. Even if we didn't want to, we get phone calls almost on a daily basis. So we're always thinking about those issues. In particular, the 9.25 and the 10.25 are the issues that we do keep close tabs on. And right now, as we sit today, it's a challenge economically to say that it's appropriate to go, right? We don't have a call available under the terms of those notes today, right? The calls don't come into effect until later next year. And to take them out right now, you'd have to use the make whole or tender for them, and that's pretty expensive. So we're continuing to monitor. As time passes, as we get closer to the intrinsic calls in the issues, the premium to take them out comes down. And time is on our side in that regard. So timing, we'll certainly monitor it every day from now going forward. Realistically, you probably over the next couple of quarters before it really becomes economically attractive to do something. But we'll certainly let you know as we think more concretely about when we might do it.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 operational questions maybe for Matt or Michael. I guess, firstly, maybe if you can give us a sense of how URI is performing versus the ARA operating metrics. Obviously, when you look at the performance for 3Q and this year, the performance is obviously quite strong. But I guess what I'm trying to gauge is where's the room for improvement? Is there a room for improvement?","Matthew J. Flannery","Sure, Manish. It's Matt. I'm not sure which metrics you'd like to hear about. But just as we look at the business, we've got a lot of focus right now and will throughout 2014 about continuing to drive more productivity. We think the scale that we've built from the merger and now that we are very comfortable in branches that are anywhere from 30% to 50% more fleet than they had pre-merger, we think we've got some opportunities to reengineer. And whether it's cost out or just not as much cost in to support our growth, we think productivity is probably our single largest next lever of opportunity.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yes, Manish, I would also add, just to give you a little color. You mentioned ARA Metrics and Rouse Analytics has a benchmark service that follows that and has a peer group that is pretty good-sized. We have in our presentation, we put in there, our dollar utilization as it relates to our industry peer group. We are -- we're the highest. We lead the industry within that peer group, which takes into account a lot of different things on dollar utilization. We also know that our rates are leading that industry peer group and have consistently done so for a period of time. But you asked where we can always improve. It comes to rate, it comes to mix, it comes to driving increased margin. And so I would tell you that we're never done. I think we have -- our best years are ahead of us, and we're going to focus intensely to achieve it.","Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, you talked a lot about the specialty equipment and the growth prospects there. Maybe if you can outline size and scale of potential acquisition opportunities in these markets.","Michael J. Kneeland","Well, the specialty sides of the business and the adjacencies, you're pointing to something that, really -- it's very fragmented, extremely fragmented. There's only -- in 1 area, there's only 1 large company in the Power, and that's something that we would be interested in. We were focusing on right now doing organic with some bolt-ons. We've got a good team. They're showing good growth. And we're going to continue to feed that opportunity. With regards to the other adjacencies that we have there, we're always opportunistic and inquisitive to what may be out there. But there's nothing that is of any magnitude. But there are some adjacencies that are attractive, and those all will be fully vetted to the same process that we've always looked at. And our model is always focusing around our strategic vision. Is it accretive? Will it enhance our returns? And then, culturally, how does it fit with the organization? So we'll always use that as a balance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the free cash flow, I know you guys, last year, on the third quarter call, were kind enough to provide a guide for free cash flow for next year. And, Bill, you've already mentioned the $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion for CapEx. I think the most recent thing we have is what David mentioned, the 625 [ph] in the Investor Day packet. Can you give us a little more color on what you are expecting for next year?","William B. Plummer","Why don't we get through our planning process for this year and give you more clarity on that in January, Scott? I mean, I certainly feel like it'll be a very robust free cash flow result. I really not like to put any new numbers on the table at this point. And so let's talk in January.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, obviously, one of the things that's been a headwind is the fleet inflation. This is the time of year where you've set pricing with your suppliers. Obviously, you can combat the fleet inflation by increasing rental rates. But any commentary on how things are progressing with supplier pricing? Are you pushing particularly strong this year?","William B. Plummer","So I think what we would say is what we've said basically since I walked through the door here, at least. We're in discussions with suppliers about next year's purchases as we speak. We feel very good about our ability to keep our overall inflation in the low -- in the very low single digits on a year-over-year basis. There will be some impacts to final Tier 4 configurations of some cat classes. But when you blend that, the impact of price increases for final Tier 4 in with the overall purchases, we're still going to be in the low -- very low single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Coppola from Thompson Research.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Just following up on rate here. Understanding that 3.2% is still nice performance, is there any deceleration from what we've been seeing? So my question is, why are you able to drive more rate at this point? And what kind of environment are you facing competitively in terms of price? And what kind of pushback are you getting from customers?","Matthew J. Flannery","Nick, it's Matt. So when you look at it on a year-over-year trend, we'll -- we continue to see sequential improvement that may not be as robust every month as it was last year. But we've seen sequential improvement throughout Q3. We expect to see sequential improvement up through December. December could be flat, but we don't need December to be sequentially improved to hit our 4%-plus target. And we're seeing most of the industry with a similar discipline around rate and understanding for all the reasons we need to, inflation of equipment costs and everything else that's involved in it. We're not really concerned that we're not going to continue to get rate improvement throughout next year. I think we referred to it earlier. We're going to go into next year with a 2% year-over-year improvement. Our year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter, we expect to be over what the year-over-year improvement was in the third quarter. And on top of that demand, we've got record time utilization for us, and as we sit here today, still a very robust time utilization. So we're very comfortable with the trajectory we're on to meet our commitments that we've made.","William B. Plummer","I'd also add that, as you look at the fourth quarter, the comparable is a little easier in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter. If you remember back last year, in the third quarter, the sequential months in the third quarter last year were very robust. July was 1.2%, August was 1.1% and September was flat. But that was a very robust third quarter. And so you're comparing to a pretty high base of pricing there. Those sequentials eased in the fourth quarter last year. And so if we can sustain the sequential momentum that we think, it'll show as an improvement in the year-over-year for the fourth quarter.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then on your unassigned accounts being up 10.5% year-over-year, certainly, very strong relative to the prior quarters, can you give us any color on what drivers were there? Is it really specifically going back after some of the folks that you left on the integration? Or is there really something there in terms of underlying demand between the smaller and the larger guys?","Matthew J. Flannery","I think it's a combination of both, Nick. It's certainly the fact that, as we had referred to earlier in the year, that we were going to put more sales reps back in the network to help accomplish that. So we've got 118 reps more today than we started the year with, and that's a net number and well on our way to our goal of 120 to 150 increase. I think the demand for these accounts is also higher. And I just think we needed to reconnect. And the combination of many outbound calling programs and a lot of activity around this, once we recognize that we lost touch with some local folks through the branch consolidations, we just made a very conscious effort, and I think that number reflects the benefits of that effort.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The margins on equipment sales were strong. And I think you said 62% are going to the branches, and that's up by 9%. Can you just give us a sense of where you see that 62% going and how quickly you might see that change over the next couple of years?","William B. Plummer","Steve, I'll take a shot at it. We don't have a specific target that we're trying to achieve. I guess you could say our target is 100%.","Matthew J. Flannery","Correct.","William B. Plummer","But I think at some point, it will slow down. I don't know that we're at the point yet where that share of retail will slow down significantly in the near term. I think we're getting better all the time at how we market used equipment. We're getting more sales collateral in the hands of our sales reps. We continually update how we present the equipment online, more pictures of the equipment. And we're running many more training actions to get sales reps focused on selling used equipment alongside rental. We're just now starting to ramp up a very focused effort on sales, export sales, for example, that should help keep that channel going. So it's hard to put numbers on it, but I think you can look for that mix to continue to shift positively. And that is going to be all good in terms of driving our margin performance. Anything you disagree with, Matt, or...","Matthew J. Flannery","No. I think Bill captures it well, and I just think it's another byproduct of the strong demand that we see from our customer base. With improved fleet growth, improved time utilization, improved year-over-year rates and improved used sales volume and margin, it is really in the retail channel, which is really our end users, I think, points to all the great indicators that we're seeing.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And a quick follow-up. Time utilization, certainly, better than expected in the third quarter. Any particular expectations you want to call out for the fourth quarter kind of going to be up year-over-year? Is that what your expectation is?","William B. Plummer","It will be exactly what it needs to be to get to 68% for the year. How's that? No, it's -- we'll continue to see our year-over-year improvement in the -- in Q4. We haven't quantified it, but -- other than what's needed to get to the full year. But we feel pretty good about how time ute is developing here. So not quite another 100-basis-point improvement, but there'll be an improvement year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any closing comments.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning everyone and welcome. And thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Listen, before I begin, I want to mention that obviously we\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on in the stock market. It\u2019s been a wild ride and there are some big issues that need solving in other parts of the globe. But this morning, we\u2019re going to be focusing on our business and the operating conditions as we see them here in North America, so let\u2019s get started.","Last night, we reported another strong financial performance and a positive operating environment. In fact I\u2019ve used those words before and I am happy to say that they\u2019re true again this quarter. It confirms that our strategy is on track and the construction and industrial recoveries are both gaining momentum. And it shows that we know how to manage the business with continuity and discipline through the early stages of the up cycle. I want to talk more about our environment before Bill goes through the numbers in detail and then after that we\u2019ll take your questions.","The first notable thing about the quarter is that our end markets are continuing to rally. Demand is up and we reported a robust 16% increase in rental revenue for the quarter. And more importantly, we accomplished this with record margin and adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year gains in volume, utilization and rates.","Volume increased 9.5% year-over-year. Time utilization was very strong at over 71% and we improved rates by 4.7%. I\u2019ve talked about the importance of these three metrics before and they\u2019re all valuable measures of performance. And while we manage our assets very strategically over the life of the equipment, we\u2019re always hungry for more and that\u2019s particularly true of rates.","Our return on invested capital was 8.4% in the quarter which is our best yet and it\u2019s another indication that our strategy is on track. And free cash flow increased to $312 million through September. And as you saw last night, we raised our free cash flow target to a range of $475 million to $525 million and we reaffirmed the other five components of our full year outlook.","Now, I want to mention a few of the dynamics that help shaped our quarter. One is our new pump business. With the integration of National Pump behind us, we\u2019ve begun cross-selling these assets to a broader base. We now have four specialty lines in place, trench safety, power and HVAC, pumps and tool solutions. These are high touch, high value services that build loyalty and engage our customers in using other types of fleet.","Our specialty segment had an 88% increase in rental revenue in the quarter and a 98% increase in gross profit so are improving our margins as we expand these operations through acquisitions, cold starts and organic growth. Now, it\u2019s worth noting that excluding acquisitions, revenue was up about 27%. And that\u2019s outstanding organic growth. In August, we announced eight specialty cold starts year-to-date and we opened three more in September and we plan another 8 to 10 branches in the fourth quarter, all in specialty.","Another area that ties to reoccurring revenue is national accounts. Our national account revenue kept pace with the company performance in the quarter at 16% growth. It\u2019s our strongest growth rate for national accounts this year. Now that large projects are picking up, these relationships are becoming increasingly important to our base. And right now, they account for about 40% of our rental revenue. And while national accounts have the small constraint on rates because of negotiated pricing, they support our strategy for the long haul which is to drive returns over time and to mitigate volatility throughout the cycle.","Now moving on to the regional front, every one of our region has delivered year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter excluding the impact of FX. And in fact, half of our regions showed double-digit growth. Now, one of the standouts was our industrial region which was up 22% due in large part to manufacturing and certain energy verticals that we\u2019re seeing strong demand from plant expansions and modernizations, particularly in the chemical sector. And while there is a healthy variety of projects across our footprint, our regions are reporting certain types of projects more frequently, they include renewable such as wind and solar farms, hospitals, sports arenas, pharmaceutical and chemical plants and urban office construction.","Now looking at the U.S. and Canada as a whole, I would characterize our current operating environments trending upward with fluctuations in local and regional markets. Underlying fundamentals of the recovery looks strong, just as they did when we had our call in July. This coincides with what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. They are very optimistic, which is probably the most valuable indicator of all. We have a lot of ways to take the temperature of our markets, but our customers are just that much closer to the action. So it\u2019s good to know that they\u2019re seeing the same momentum we do.","Also on a national front, we\u2019re seeing continued strength in used equipment market, [a solid] [Ph] good sign of healthy demand for equipment. Our adjusted gross margin for used sales was about 48% in the third quarter consistent with the prior year.","Now we\u2019re obviously aware of the volatility in the stock market right now, but most of that\u2019s global and we don\u2019t see it relates to our industry any meaningful way here in North America. There will always be bumps in the road and our end markets as we move to recovery. But there are far more ups than downs and secular penetration is adding an extra layer of demand. And we\u2019ve shown that we can navigate the business successfully through much greater macro uncertainty than this.","Now turning to our internal initiatives, I want to give you a quick update on two programs that should have significant impact for years to come. The first is lean and the second is technology, specifically Telematics. We\u2019ve been talking to you about our lean program for the better part of this year. The philosophy of continuous improvement based on the kaizen process. 314 of our branch managers and over 2,100 employees have now participated in kaizen event since our pilot a year ago.","And that was enough history with lean, we can share some metrics and they are very encouraging. For example, the branches that have been through the kaizen\u2019s for order accuracy; we\u2019ve seen a reduction of about 16% in the credit memos issued as a percent of rental revenue. And while the kaizen focus has been to bring down transportation cost, our main branches are seeing measurable improvement.","Results like these have an immediate ramification on productivity and customer service. Our three year target of a $100 million in efficiencies should be very achievable. We will already identify the run rate of approximately $18 million in utilization and cost efficiencies. And as always we\u2019ll push for more to see the opportunity.","The other area I mentioned is Telematics, which [bolstered] the way we use GPS technology to manage the performance of our larger assets. We currently have GPS on about 6,000 machines mostly generators and select big equipment. And we plan to extend Telematics to another 160,000 units by the end of 2015. These will be units with diesel engines and other types of powered equipments such as Electric Scissor Lifts.","The Telematics could potentially increase utilization. The benefits are going to be in the areas of preventive maintenance, employee productivity and most of all customer service, because Telematics can reduce downtime.","We\u2019re the industry\u2019s biggest advocate for technology and this initiative is right in line with our focus on innovation. It also supports our strategy for rental CapEx which is to manage and protect our assets as we move them through the rental process in a way that generates optimal returns.","I want to conclude my comments this morning by recapping my three main points; number one, the macro environment stable when end markets are in recovery. Demand in 2014 is up over last year and the forecast is even stronger for 2015. And we don\u2019t see anything that suggest otherwise. Number two, we\u2019re comfortable with our full year guidance. We raise those numbers in July based on our internal and external visibility and we\u2019ve raised our free cash flow range last night as our other targets -- nothing has changed. And finally, we have the right strategy in place to deliver the value creation. And what\u2019s more, we have a record of very strong execution.","There will always be puts and takes to our metrics, but taking in aggregate, our results reflect the trajectory that\u2019s consistently outperforming the recovery in our end markets and that\u2019s an exciting endorsement of our business model.","2014 is playing out as a record year for us, but even so we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve demonstrated just a fraction of what this company can achieve over a multiple years in our cycle. So the present is pretty great, but from where we stand the future looks even better.","So with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results and then after that I will take your call and questions. Over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. As always, I\u2019ll add a little bit more color to the key headlines that you\u2019ve already seen in the press release and the numbers that Mike has outlined. Starting with the revenue picture which as we said is a pretty strong one for us in the quarter; rental revenues in the quarter were up 15.6% and it reflected the strength that Michael mentioned in rates and volume and other components of our revenue generation. Within that 15.6%, our owned equipment revenue was up about 15.4% and I\u2019ll go through the components of what drove that.","But let me start with just the re-rent and ancillary component of our rental revenue growth, very robust growth in those two components in the quarter totaling about $25 million of year-over-year improvement in revenues from re-rent and ancillaries.","Within the OER component, rental rates were up 4.7 as we said. And that contributed about $46 million worth of rental revenue improvement. Volume was up the 9.5% that Mike mentioned which drove about $94 million of year-over-year rental revenue improvement. The story there was the story of a larger fleet and better utilization of that fleet in the quarter. We spent about $456 million on fleet in the quarter and that drove our average fleet size up 8.4% for the year in the quarter and then we utilized that fleet more effectively with time utilization in the quarter coming in 71.5% or 70 basis points better than the comparable period last year. That resulted in the 9.5% OEC on rent growth that we call out as volume. And I\u2019ll point out that even if you exclude the addition of National Pump in the quarter, our OEC on rent growth was still an impressive 6.9%. So it wasn\u2019t just the impact of the acquisitions driving that volume growth.","Fleet inflation as always has been a headwind for us in the quarter as we sell out older fleet and replace it with newer acquired fleet at higher prices. The impact there on a percentage basis within OER was 1.7% headwind that translates into about $17 million worth of headwind in the year-over-year rental revenue performance.","We call out FX for the last few quarters because it\u2019s been a material impact in the year-over-year drivers, so this quarter was no different. The Canadian dollar year-over-year was down about 5%. So that cost us about $7 million of year-over-year revenue, 7 million of headwind which translates into about a minus 0.7% against the OER growth.","Mix and other was robustly positive again in the quarter, call it 3.6% or $36 million of positive impact in the quarter. Now obviously, adding an attractive segment like pump in the quarter was a big driver of the positive mix there, call it 30 of the 36 from the mix impact of National Pump. But even aside from that, we had a positive impact from sweeter mix of products in the rest of our business along with some other minor positives. So the net effect mix was a real robust $36 million.","So all of those components added together give you the $177 million of year-over-year rental revenue improvement. And the momentum that we\u2019re feeling as Mike pointed out is robustly positive going into fourth quarter as well.","Moving to used equipment sales, another good quarter in used equipment sales, a $140 million of proceeds from used and a very nice 47.9% adjusted margin in the process. So, we\u2019re seeing continued robust demand overall in all of our channels for used equipment in the quarter. Our retail channel mix was down a little bit in the quarter, roughly 10 percentage points, not due to anything other than the fact that we did a little bit more in the quarter in some of the other channels. Retail contribution was still up nicely on a year-over-year basis, up more than 20%. So we\u2019re continuing to focus to drive used equipment sales through our retail channel as well as the other channels as well and that contributed to the very strong used results in the quarter.","On the profitability front, you saw the adjusted EBITDA of $761 million in the quarter at a company record 49.3%, actually both those numbers were company records in the third quarter; actually EBITDA margin was a record overall. That was a $119 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement and 30 basis-point improvement from the prior year. The key drivers of that $119 million of improvement were as follows: Rental rate contributed about $45 million of incremental EBITDA, that\u2019s the 4.7% rental rate improvement flow through at about 95%. The volume component, we counted $66 million of impact on EBITDA.","The fleet inflation component was a headwind of $10 million at EBITDA from the previous inflation revenue impact that I talked about. Our ancillary improvement, ancillary revenue improvement was another $11 million of EBITDA impact and again that\u2019s driven by the improvements that we\u2019re making in our pickup and delivery revenues as well as certain other ancillary items like our RPP program. Used equipment sales, the margin impact there was $19 million contribution to EBITDA in the quarter. And then the other components were a variety of one-off items. So, we had an increase in our cash incentive compensation programs in the quarter that cost us about $10 million. Cash comp went up, because our performance for the year is coming in strong and so we\u2019re accruing more for cash compensation and we made the adjustment in the third quarter to the tune of about $10 million year-over-year.","Merit increase, that\u2019s our normal merit increase throughout the course of the year. In the quarter, it was about $6 million worth of headwind and then a variety of other components contributed to the remaining $11 million of headwind of which bad debt expense was about $4 million of that headwind, reflecting not so much any deterioration in our experience with bad debt, but more just the size of the accounts receivable balance requiring a larger reserve to be set aside.","So, those are the key drivers of the $119 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement and again reflect all of the components that we talked about before.","You put that revenue and EBITDA performance together you get an adjusted flow-through for the quarter of 51.1% and that flow-through while below the 60% that we\u2019ve been guiding to you for the full year still puts us in line to deliver the full year 60% flow-through. In fact if you look at flow-through for the year-to-date period, we\u2019re right at 59.7% year-to-date flow-through. So we\u2019re well positioned to be able to deliver the flow-through of 60% over the course of the full year.","We have been getting questions about what was it that drove third quarter flow-through to be less than a 60% to be indeed at that 51% or so. And the couple of things that I would point to you there are the bad debt impacts that I called out that alone was worth about a 0.5 of headwind against our flow-through in the quarter. The cash comp increased that I called out as well probably caused us about 3.5 points of flow-through in the quarter. And then the robust other lines of business; used equipment sales, new equipment sales in particular very strong growth in those two lines. So the mix effect of those lower margin revenues coming in, in the quarter was probably another 0.5.","So, call it 6.5 or 7 points worth of drag on flow-through just from those three items. Add those back to the 51% you get pretty dollar on close to the 60%. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about flow-through for year-to-date and more importantly how we\u2019re going to get to the 60% for the full year.","EPS in the quarter was also a very strong $2.20 and on an adjusted EPS basis that compares to the $1.63 that we reported last year. So 35% improvement and obviously EPS reflects all of the other points that we\u2019ve made.","Before I go to the outlook; just a couple of points on free cash flow, capital structure and liquidity. Free cash flow was very strong as Mike pointed out, $312 million. Remind everybody that includes the impact of our merger-related cash outflows. Those were about $16 million in the quarter. So if you look on the ex-merger basis, free cash flow in the first nine months was $328 million, very robust free cash flow picture. And of course, that\u2019s after we spent on capital in the quarter. Total capital was $1.750 billion that includes the rental capital plus the non-rental capital.","So even after the capital investments were on track for very robust free cash flow year. And in fact that pace is what gave us the courage to increase the free cash flow outlook for the full year. We\u2019ve seen a very robust delivery of operating cash flow year-to-date. We\u2019ve seen very strong collections against our accounts receivable year-to-date and the timing of our accounts payable year-to-date has broken favorably. So you put all that stuff together and that\u2019s what prompted us to raise our outlook for free cash flow by about $25 million for the full year.","On capital structure and liquidity, liquidity was a total of about $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter and that included $900 million of ABL capacity plus about $170 million of cash in the bank. So our liquidity position is very strong. We did during the quarter amend our accounts receivable facility, it\u2019s $550 million facility that we amended to extend the maturity for another year. So that positions us with that facility as well.","The share repurchase program, you heard us announce that we are accelerating the completion of that program to the end of this year. We have spent $389 million on the program life-to-date that includes $152 million during the quarter and it positions us very nicely to be able to finish it out by the end of the year. The combination of slightly stronger free cash flow plus as Mike said, we\u2019re paying attention to the real world, our stock price being down, prompted us to say look, let\u2019s just get it done during calendar 2014 and then figure out where we go from there. So that\u2019s the rational for accelerating the repurchase.","ROIC was strong as Mike mentioned for the quarter trailing 12 months, 8.4%, a company record that\u2019s 1.3 percentage points better than the same period last year and it\u2019s a 30 basis point improvement compared to where we were at the end of the second quarter. So, we continue to be on track to drive our ROIC higher, targeting cost of capital and ultimately that 10% hurdle rate that we talked as a target, nice progress against that in the third quarter as well.","On the outlook, we reaffirmed all the components with the exception of free cash flow. So just to recap where we are, we still expect the full year revenue, total revenue coming in the full year between 5,550 million and 5,650 million. That includes of course rental rate performance in the rental revenue component that we continue to expect at about 4.5% year-over-year for the full year. Time utilization, robust in the quarter and positioned us well to be able to deliver the 68.5% time utilization that we\u2019ve given as an outlook, we\u2019re sticking to that as well as the adjusted EBITDA range of between $2.650 billion and $2.7 billion for the full year.","CapEx and cash flow, we touched on already. CapEx, we continue to expect to invest, net rental CapEx of $1.2 billion and that of course is after gross spends on new rental equipment of $1.7 billion and the free cash flow range I touched on.","So, those are the comments that I\u2019d offer as color for the numbers. Obviously we can go into more detail in the Q&A but let me add my thought to Mike\u2019s thought. We\u2019re well positioned and everything that we see in hear keeps us on that path for 2014. We certainly are not na\u00efve to what\u2019s going on in the outside world, but we feel good about where we are, what we\u2019re hearing from our customers and how we\u2019re running our business. So, we\u2019re going to continue to drive forward and we\u2019ll talk to you as we go forward about the results that we achieve.","So, with that I\u2019ll open up the call for questions and answers. Operator, can we open it up?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll go first to Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. ","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Hey guys, congratulations on the quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","William Plummer","Hey Ted, thanks.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","I was hoping just to kind of come back to the 2015 outlook, and I know you haven\u2019t provided kind of formal guidance. But Mike, your body language is quite positive. And if I didn\u2019t hear your right, I think you said that the business feels to be accelerating and there is obviously seasonality. But could you maybe just touch on at least a framework for how you\u2019re thinking about 2015? And I think a lot of questions that we get are kind of on energy and energy exposure and kind of what you\u2019re picking up from those customers and maybe how much of that business that constitutes.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, I\u2019ll talk part of it then I\u2019ll ask Matt and maybe Bill to chime in as well. We\u2019re looking at the forecasts that obviously are produced by Global Insight as well as we\u2019re looking at IIR which is an industrial resource and looking at how they\u2019re seeing the world. And they continue to see 2015 stronger than 2014. Obviously, they can always update but we haven\u2019t seen any material change. As we went through the quarter, we saw momentum building and then that\u2019s particularly true in our time utilization as we went through.","The other thing I would tell you is just a data point Ted is another thing that we look at is the construction backlog indicator which is produced by the American builders and contractors in August; it reached an all-time high. We\u2019re still waiting for the report to come out sometime in October or in early November. But those are some other indicators that we see. As I mentioned in my opening comments, talking to our customers and their outlook of how they see the next 12 months, again as we went through the quarter that progression of optimism grew as well.","So, those are the things that we look at. With regards to the oil, I would point out oil and gas is how we look at it. We don\u2019t bifurcate the two because of how we go after the market. All-in and I am talking about upstream, downstream and midstream, and looking at 10.5% of our total business. If you take a look at I think where you\u2019re trying to drive to is the area of where we would see exploration on oil would be around 5%. Now that 5% will also include pump, it would also include the gas, natural gas as well. Natural gas, the LNG plants and everything that we\u2019ve seen is continuing to go along. Matt, if you want to?","Matt Flannery","Yes. Mike covered that we don\u2019t necessarily have a lot of exposure to oil and gas. But I think more importantly is the fleet that we use to serve that vertical market is compatible to the rest of our fleet. So if something did change in that sector, we have robust growth throughout our network and throughout many verticals that we could move that fleet because it\u2019s core to our offering to other verticals and other end markets.","And when I talk about the breadth of our end markets, Mike mentioned that more than half of our regions had double-digit improvement in the year-over-year rent revenue. Well, we had over 30 states that had double-digit improvement in rent revenue year-over-year and 5 of our 10 provinces in Canada. And all, but four states showed year-over-year rental revenue improvement and 8 of our 10 provinces. So when we say we have broad demand, we really do have broad demand throughout our network.","","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","","And then the follow-up I\u2019d ask is just from the standpoint of just kind of taking share on your competitive positioning, can you just maybe give us a sense for how you think you\u2019re doing relative to kind of a broader growth because honestly my sense is non [Inaudible] your market\u2019s probably are not increasing double-digit rates. So just from the standpoint of how you think about market share capture next year, maybe can you just touch on that?","Michael Kneeland","Well, we haven\u2019t gone through the process and obviously we\u2019re going to have our December meeting coming up for our investors. But the way I would look at it is what is projected today by global insight for our industry for 2014 is 8% growth.","We just reported a 16% growth and I think you can get a sense of how we\u2019re outperforming. I want to make sure everyone understands. Well, I\u2019m not thinking about just growing for market share, I\u2019m talking about growing for profitable growth and returns and those are the things that we\u2019re most interested in.","So again, I think that we\u2019re performing well. I think that our specialty business clearly is outperforming the industry by a multiple. And I think you can see the power of the cross-sell that we\u2019re actually benefiting from right here and now.","William Plummer","Yes. I\u2019m a simple guy, Ted, I just step back and I say, have we driven our business throughout the course of the year, rental revenue year-to-date is up 14.2%. I would guess that there aren\u2019t a lot of rental companies that can say the same thing. And so I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves against the overall environment and against the competitive set pretty well. That positions us well to be able to continue to do that next year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay. Well, that\u2019s great. Best of luck this quarter and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Hey thanks. Good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","I want to talk about the rental metrics a little bit for the quarter. So time utilization was actually much better than what we were expecting, rate was good. But I\u2019m wondering does the upside to the time utilization, should we infer anything into that that you\u2019re pushing time versus rate anymore going forward and is that any kind of reflection of the national account growth that we\u2019ve been seeing? Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Hi Seth, this is Matt. We absolutely are continuing to push both rate and time and we feel that the demand is there to get both. We saw record realized rate in Q3 and we saw record time as we closed Q3 in September. And I\u2019m pleased to say that that kind of demand is as we sit here today in October, we\u2019re seeing sequential rates continuing to grow at about half a point and the time utilization gap that year-over-year which was a 1.6% positive, a 160 basis points positive in September, as of last night, we maintained that 160 basis points gap. So, we\u2019re seeing the demand continue and we feel that rate and time are both again there for us for the taking.","Michael Kneeland","The other thing I would add to that is the only thing that we saw in September is our national account did grow faster than our core business. And as I mentioned, a lot of these larger projects are coming on line.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Right. Mike, you mentioned, I think the phrase you used was \u201cnegotiated pricing\u201d and I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m trying to understand this market a little bit better, because some of your competitors have talked about going after the national account market more aggressively. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how that -- as this market becomes a bigger part of your mix and as other competitors are going after it, your ability to sustain rate here and your ability to continue to -- for that business to grow at these types of levels, at a profitable level; I mean have you noticed any change on the competitive front, I guess on a national account business.","Matt Flannery","Overall in aggregate, no. I think there maybe some movement within who is the number two, number three, number four players for some accounts. But as Mike had mentioned, our September growth for national accounts was almost 19%. So, that\u2019s as high a number as we\u2019ve had in the quarter. So we\u2019re actually seeing our momentum pick up. Is that a slight drag on sequential rate? It can be in a quarter but we\u2019re -- I think Bill guided properly of where we get to see rate going forward. We\u2019ve talked about that and we think that 3% is the entry level for us and somewhere between that 3% and\/or about 4.5 guidance for this year is the goals that we look for going forward.","Michael Kneeland","The only thing I would only add is look, we can\u2019t be complacent. We have to continue and as I mentioned in my comments to be innovative and think about how we can enhance our value proposition to our customers. I just mentioned that we announced that we\u2019re going to have 160,000 units by the end of next year with GPS. I guess there are other competitors who have GPS capability, they typically will put it on and charge for an extra charge. December, we\u2019ll give you some understanding of what we intend to do with the GPS technology and how we think that we can continue to focus on improving our value proposition in comparison to the competitive environment. That\u2019s what we\u2019re learning and that\u2019s our job. And I am very happy to report that the team is very active and thinking that through.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you for that. If I could just ask a quick follow-up kind of piggybacking on Ted\u2019s question about 2015, Bill, is it fair to think about pull-through margin at the same levels, is high 50%, 60% pull-through margin you think sustainable into 2015 and how much of this $100 million lean initiative you think is part of that?","William Plummer","We said in the past that we believe 60% is a reasonable way to think about pull-through margins for the next couple of years. So yes, 60, if you\u2019re thinking about 2015 is a good starting point. Obviously we\u2019ll sharpen that as we finalize our plan for the year and talk about it at future points. So that feels about right. I\u2019m sorry; the second part of your question was\u2026?","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Just how much of the 100 million of initiatives, the lean initiatives that you see on cash during 2015?","William Plummer","Yes. We haven\u2019t boiled it down to an expected realized dollar amount. Again, as we go through our planning process and think about what our guidance for \u201815 is going to look like, we\u2019ll figure out what more we might want to say on that. So stay tuned.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you very much guys.","William Plummer","Thanks Seth.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks Seth.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Dave Raso with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","","Michael Kneeland","Hey David.","","David Raso - ISI Group","","A quick question on \u201814 question then a question on \u201815. The utilization I know seasonally peaks in October but still just given the way you\u2019ve started the quarter, it would appear to get to your full year utilization increase to 40 bps. The drop off in November, December in utilization appears to be a little heavier than normal seasonality. Am I reading that correctly or is it maybe utilization is the area that maybe is little upside to the guide but then the rate is that the trade off on it. I\u2019m just trying to understand are we seeing something for November and December that would imply a little further decline in normal seasonality over the last two months of the year.","William Plummer","Maybe I\u2019ll start. I think we saw a very robust utilization result in the third quarter. And it\u2019s hard for us to extend that thinking too aggressively in the fourth quarter. Obviously we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that we get as much utilization as we can in November, December. But we haven\u2019t really aggressively moved those utilization months up from what we thought earlier in the year.","So we\u2019re continuing to look at it. If October finish is out the way started then maybe we\u2019ll have to revise our thinking. But right now there is nothing dramatic negative going on in the November, December timeframe that we\u2019re protecting against or concerned about. It\u2019s just we haven\u2019t gotten to the point of saying, yes third quarter and October let\u2019s goose up November, December based on those results, haven\u2019t got there yet.","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay. So that\u2019s someway go there. On 2015, I know that the stock supple out today, but obviously stocks been off, it influenced your use of cash and the time of the repo for 2014. Can you walk us through the cash flow for next year, the use of it? How the stock price may influence your thoughts on moving forward with more repo versus maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the M&A market?","William Plummer","I think it\u2019s important to say that the stock price isn\u2019t really the guiding light for our decision about whether we do a repurchase and how much of a repurchase that we do. That comes out of our consideration for how to allocate our capital and our free cash flow. And we try to think about that question in longer term strategic terms. That\u2019s what led us to the $500 million program that we\u2019re currently on. And that\u2019s what we would think about as we consider whether and how much of a follow-on program we could or might do.","So that thinking is going on right here now. The stock price at the margin may prompt us to say let\u2019s go a little bit faster, a little bit slower within the broad framework that we established. So in this case, the current 500 we said initially it was going to be 500 over the period extending till April of 2015. As we got into it, and so our cash will come in and so the stock price come down, we adjust it as we thought appropriate.","And so tactically that\u2019s the way we would manage any future program as well. But the program itself both existence and scale would come out of what we think our cash flow is going to look like over the long-term over the next number of years. And we\u2019ll continue to talk about that as we sharpen our thinking about 2015 and future.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. And David on an M&A front, our principles have never, they haven\u2019t changed one bit. They have to be strategic, it has to be accretive and you know our goal around return on invested capital and the other part would be a cultural fit. So, and it\u2019s a pretty high hurdle and we\u2019re very comfortable with that.","David Raso - ISI Group","The net debt to EBITDA 2.9 at the end of the year; when I think about how you\u2019re going to manage that through \u201815, are you comfortable maintaining the 2.9, obviously I\u2019m trying to figure out whatever I believe the cash flow will be for next year. Can I assume you\u2019re going to put that all to work? I know you\u2019ve got roughly about a $125 million of earn out you have to pay to the National Pump deals assuming you hit their target. But are we comfortable assuming where the net debt to EBITDA ends this year? Is a comfortable ratio for the end of \u201815?","William Plummer","I think and we\u2019ve said that next year 2015 we believe that the leverage should trend lower, so lower than the 2.9. And in fact I think I\u2019ve said in the past, we see it toward the lower end of the 2.5 and 3.5 range that we\u2019ve talked about. That thinking certainly would have us using our cash flow to both pay down debt, but also to finish up our current share repurchase. And we would continue to think about it that way, the leverage path that way even if we decided to do another share repurchase. Obviously that all assumes de minimis in the way of acquisitions if a significant acquisition comes along, we would reassess that path of leverage that we\u2019d want to be on. And we talk about it at the time of announcing the acquisition, right. But our thinking right now ex acquisitions is that we\u2019re going to trend toward the lower end of the range during 2015 and finish up toward the lower end of that range.","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","William Plummer","","Thank you, Dave.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks Dave.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Joe O\u2019Dea with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Joe O\u2019Dea - Vertical Research","Hi, good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Joe O\u2019Dea - Vertical Research","First question on lean and it looks like from the slides that employee participation was higher in 3Q versus 2Q that the actual branch participation was more or less in line. And so as you approach year two of the implementation, could you talk a little bit about how lean evolves and what the key goals become in year two of that process?","Matt Flannery","Sure Joe. Part of what you see as far as more participation is the aggregate, right, we aggregate how many folks have been through lean as our goal to get through as many of our 12,000 employees as we can. I\u2019d say, the bigger opportunity for us is you\u2019ll see in that slide, I am sure you\u2019re referring slide 21; we\u2019ve done 141 branches but 314 branch managers. We do believe there is an opportunity for us to spread through our line management some of the lean processes and procedures as well as push out some very simple best practices that we\u2019ve discovered during the lean projects and the kaizens that we\u2019ve done and push them out through the broader organization. One example of that would be counter accuracy and you\u2019ll see the term BPRO in there. That was a designed rollout as a result of findings during kaizen events at multiple branches that we felt we\u2019d share with the broader organization and we are seeing metrics very favorable throughout kaizen and non-kaizen branches in our order accuracy because of that. And I think you\u2019ll see us continue to work down that path in our lean management process.","Michael Kneeland","That\u2019s right. Just to add, that\u2019s the process for driving the culture change that lean represents. We recognize that it is fundamental culture change, the different way of looking at your business. And we\u2019re taking the variety of the paths to drive that culture change whether it\u2019s direct training, whether it\u2019s rolling out BPROs best practice rollouts whether it\u2019s just generally talking about what lean means to an organization. We\u2019re deploying all of those and doing it in a structured reason way to make that lean implementations stick, because that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to deliver the 100 million and beyond of benefits from that change in mindset. So, we\u2019ll continue to work on it and talk about it and welcome your questions about it.","Joe O\u2019Dea - Vertical Research","Okay, thanks. And then, second question just on National Pump and with respect to CapEx plans, how are oil prices right now influencing your equipment spend plans and if no change so far, how long before $80 oil leads to hold off on some considered investments?","","Matt Flannery","I\u2019d say no change so far is definitely the way to think about our capital plans. Unless and until we actually see a pull back from our customer base, we\u2019re going to continue to invest. And even then, even if we saw a little bit of a pull back, we would have a debate about what does it represent and how does it impact our plan for investing in our pump business, in fact in all of our specialty businesses. It may not mean anything.","If you look at National Pump through the last recession, they were on a growth path that was so aggressive that they didn\u2019t have a downturn back in the 2009-2010 timeframe. So we would have to ask our sales, are we positioned so that we can find demand outside of a slowing oil and gas sector that to continue on the growth path and therefore justify continued investment. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a ridicules path to have for the pump business or indeed most of our specialty businesses.","Michael Kneeland","As I say strategically on the pump business, I just want to remind everybody. It was a roughly $200 million tower volume play. It was 50% of their business in that oil and gas arena. If you recall, 6% of our business or their business is in our sweet spot and we\u2019re almost $5 billion. So the idea was, is taking that knowledge and springing it and cross-selling it to our customer base as opposed to us going after their customer base. And that strategically we found very attractive.","Joe O\u2019Dea - Vertical Research","Great. Thanks very much.","Matt Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Steven.","Eric Crawford - UBS","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Eric Crawford on for Steve.","Michael Kneeland","Hey Eric.","Eric Crawford - UBS","Hi. Circling back to Seth\u2019s question on time utilization, with all your operational improvements with the lean and Telematics initiatives, how are you framing the puts and takes around what the new normal for time utilization can look like? I mean clearly, it varies by equipment type, but do you think you can raise each category in other couple of hundred bps from where it sounds today?","William Plummer","Yes, Eric. We\u2019ve talked in the past about operating in the 70s on average throughout the course of the year. So yes, that would be a couple of 100 basis points from the full year 68.5 that we\u2019re expecting this year. And we certainly feel like lean and some of things that we\u2019re doing to change internally will help us get there.","So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it broadly, is in the 70s. If you got a couple of drinks and the three of us that we all might give a slightly different number in the 70s, but it\u2019s going to be in the 70s and that\u2019s couple of 100 basis points north of here at least.","Eric Crawford - UBS","Okay. We\u2019ll work on getting those drinks with you. I guess switching over to the dollar utilization, nice uptick year-over-year and sequentially across all the categories, but the largest step up was year-over-year at least was in earthmoving equipment. Could you speak to your availability in that category specifically and how the demand has trended relative to your expectations?","Matt Flannery","I think the demand is ticked up at about the same pace that most of our other core products. I think we made a little bit more consorted effort on fleet mix. And therefore we\u2019re calling on a broader customer base in the broad base we already had. ","So we continue to want to have broadened our offerings for a lot of reasons. And we think that it\u2019s part of that opportunity. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing; you\u2019re seeing the results of that. And I think as we continue to tie our sales efforts to our fleet mix efforts, we\u2019ll see continued growth in both scale of our other non-aerial, reach fork products, as well as returns.","Eric Crawford - UBS","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Good morning guys.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Congrats on a nice quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Thank you.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","So, most of my questions have been answered, but maybe the one box we haven\u2019t kicked yet is just the M&A backlog what you guys are thinking from an acquisition perspective as a potential use of cash in 2015?","William Plummer","Nicole good morning, it\u2019s Bill. I think the way we approach M&A, the way Michael articulated earlier, we certainly look at a variety of opportunities, we look carefully because it\u2019s been an important part of how we\u2019ve driven the company forward, but we\u2019re also very disciplined in when we actually execute a transaction.","So, we\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities as they come. As I\u2019m sure everybody is aware there have been a number of opportunities, there are number of properties available in our sector over the last recent periods. And we\u2019ve taken a look at the ones that make sense for us and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But nothing more to say on that front right here now. Matt, Michael you guys want to add anything?","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, got it.","Matt Flannery","Other than just to say Mike said it on every quarterly call we have the bar is high and if the bar is high for us and we\u2019ll continue to keep that bar high.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Good to hear. And then maybe just one on CapEx into next year, I mean is it fair to assume that we\u2019re going to have kind of another flattish year, 1.7ish billion of gross CapEx in 2015 or is there scope to increase given that you guys are seeing improvement in your end markets?","William Plummer","Yes. Well, certainly we feel there is justification for another $1.7 billion next year that\u2019s our thinking right here now. Could it go a little higher than that, yes, it could go a little higher. We\u2019re in the midst of that plan process right now. And that\u2019s currently on the table. And I would say if the utilization trend that we\u2019ve seen here late in the year continues right to the earlier discussion if November, December don\u2019t fall off or indeed if they do a little bit better then I think we would have to put at least another $100 million on the table in that kind of environment. Matt\u2019s smiling here so. Our arm wrestling match is going to continue once this call is over but that\u2019s the range that we\u2019re thinking about and the market certainly as we sit today, the market feels like it supports that.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. And the other thing I would say Nicole is that we are very disciplined in our approach and how we use CapEx and that will stay with the company and our belief.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, understand. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks Nicole.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Michael Kneeland","Hey Scott.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","","Thanks for taking the question. I just want to talk a little bit about the increase of free cash flow guidance. Bill, could you talk a little bit about what some drivers were of the strength in the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about the multi-year free cash flow guidance right now? Thanks.","William Plummer","Sure Scott. I think I touched on it. The key driver in the quarter and for outlook for the full year is the momentum that we\u2019ve seen on collections. Our DSO performance is coming in nicely relative to what we expected. So that\u2019s feeling more confident around the collections that we\u2019re going to experience. And then we got greater visibility on the timing of our payables for the quarter, during third quarter and a greater visibility to what fourth quarter is going to look like. So, those were the two main drivers for the increase in guidance for this year.","It sets us up nicely for next year. We have talked in the past about being north of 600 million of free cash flow during calendar 2015 and we certainly continue to feel good about that. And again, we\u2019ll sharpen that as we finalize our plan for 2015 and report more on it either in our Investor Day or when we deliver fourth quarter earnings. So well positioned for next year to be in that north of 600 range and then beyond that \u201816 and \u201817, assuming the cycle place out, look better still.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Excellent, thanks. And then just following up on a question earlier with regard to M&A, it does seem like there are a lot of opportunities out that [wait]. Could you just kind of compare contrast looking in your traditional equipment rental business versus specialty on an M&A and maybe some of the areas you\u2019re looking to branch out into in specialty or just [work] out there?","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike. I would tell you that obviously we\u2019ve been talking about specialty as an area of growth for us. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk more about that at the Investor Day. We have a keen interest in that arena. And there is a lot of areas we don\u2019t understand. And again we look at that strategic return and cultural fit. So, all those things have to come into play. As Bill mentioned, there has been a lot of properties that have been up for sale. And we\u2019ve looked and we\u2019ve cash, because of the high bar, that will continue. So I would say that we\u2019re always acquisitive and we\u2019ll always look and we\u2019ll try to understand and how that can benefit the company, not just in a year over time for longevity but tie it to our strategy and the return metrics that we\u2019re looking for.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs & Company. Please go ahead.","Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs & Company","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. Just briefly wanted to talk on the capital allocation side and if you could maybe touch on what regions you are seeing outsized capital allocation towards, maybe where you are seeing the most growth and maybe give us one, two and three of the top regions within your company.","Matt Flannery","Sure Matt. It\u2019s pretty broad based and we have a very rigorous process when we put out growth capital. So, when you think about our capital, large portion of it is replacement. And because of the broad based opportunities we\u2019ve seen throughout our network, we\u2019ve been giving all of our regions the appropriate replacement capital. And then they earn growth capital based on the returns, not just the demand in the end market.","Mike said earlier, we\u2019re chasing not just growth for growth sake, but profitable growth and we do allot our capital appropriately. You can imagine where the hot pockets in the markets have been along the Gulf Coast, but we\u2019re seeing growth in the Midwest and on the West Coast, as well as in Northeast as well. So, we\u2019re really seeing a very broad-based growth and we\u2019re allocating our capital appropriately.","Michael Kneeland","And the other thing I would add to that is a proportion of our growth capital has gone to our specialty business. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing the fantastic growth that they\u2019ve been able to produce.","Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs & Company","Great. I know you touched on it, just to follow-up a little bit on the beginning of the call, but from an end market standpoint, Gulf Coast obviously large petchem potentially LNG build out there. But can you maybe touch on which end markets are driving the strength in the Midwest and in the Northeast?","Michael Kneeland","Well, I mean I think if you take a look at, it goes in line with what you\u2019re seeing, the consensus report. There are things like commercial, healthcare, power; manufacturing and multifamily are all seeing nice improvements. So those are probably be the likely areas that you\u2019re going to see where we\u2019re putting it.","As I mentioned in my call, kind of broad-based all the multiple different types of projects; I was just recently down at a race car facility where they\u2019re doing a major expansion. And so it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s very broad in general. But those will probably be the hot buttons that you can take a look at.","Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs & Company","Great. Thank you very much.","Michael Kneeland","Okay. Operator I think this is a good time to wrap up the Q&A. I do want to remind everyone to download our investor presentation if you haven\u2019t already. Please give us a call in Stamford or give Fred Bratman a call, particularly if you want something to discuss or if you want to see a branch visit or go to a branch visit. Also please make note that December 04, is our Annual Investor Day in New York, we\u2019re very excited about it and I hope you\u2019ll attend. But if you can\u2019t, you can join us on the webcast.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer and Matt Flannery, Executive Vice President - Operations and Sales. ","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome. With me today, is our CFO, Bill Plummer, Matt Flannery, our Executive Vice President of Operations and Sales and other members of our senior management team.","Matt has been leading the integration planning for our merger with RSC and I have asked him to share some details about that process, so I have three speakers this morning. But first I want to spend a few minutes on the quarter and the closing of the transaction. So I\u2019ll start with the results. ","You saw the numbers we reported last night. We had a very good quarter, we showed 21% growth in rental revenues and realized $231 million of adjusted EBITDA in our slowest seasonal quarter. In fact our performance surpassed all prior first quarters with record time utilization, record fleet growth and record adjusted EBITDA and a record margin. Once again we drove the profitable growth faster than the construction recovery and this time we got some modest help, from the environment. Spending our non-residential construction appears to be running year over year. Now, I have to wait for the March numbers to see of that holds true. ","And the architecture billing index, which has remained above 50 for the commercial and industrial sector for 7 straight months and this morning the ABI reported that the March index for our sector was 56. So, as you know we felt good about 2012 going into this year and we are just as bullish now and even more confident about our outlook. ","We put $300 million of gross CapEx into the market in the first three months, because we saw demand and as a result show we didn\u2019t just grow our fleet, we put it on at rent, at good margins."," ","Our rates improved more than 6% year-over-year, and time utilization was our first quarter record for us at 62.3%. Now, both of these metrics are in line with our expectations. These results speak volumes about the effectiveness of our strategy and the ongoing secular shift towards renting. ","We\u2019re managing the business to a new kind of construction cycle, one that benefits from both the upswing in activity and a change in customer behavior. Now, we\u2019re making the right decisions at the top, more important our branch teams and our sales organizations are doing a stellar job of acting on those decisions, by living up to our promise of exceptional customer service, as the heart of our value proposition and are conducting business more safely than ever. We cut our [ph]reportable rate for more than half in the first quarter, so a lot of credit goes to this field and I commend them for the progress that they are making. ","Now, as a quick overview, I can tell you that all of our operating regions show double digit rental revenue improvement in the quarter compared to last year. But our strategy doesn\u2019t focus just on the top line. We\u2019re pushing hard for profitable growth, in the Southwest for example where the environment has been challenging over the past two years. We showed 20% rental revenue growth in the quarter. And we also had a 5.7% rate improvement, as well as the strongest utilization improvement of any region, up 7.6 percentage points. ","In the Gulf, with demand drove rates up 8.6%, our time utilization also improved. Now that being said, some areas are more robust than others. In Eastern Canada, although we are up year-over-year, we don\u2019t expect the same vigorous market conditions that we saw last year. We still anticipate that rental revenue growths will be in the double digits, but it maybe they\u2019re at slower pace. Now, the balance of rates and utilization is top of mind for all of our branches in every sales person. Our people know that when we compete for business, particularly big projects, the revenue dollars could be exiting, if the margins have to be protected. ","Some sectors overseeing demand are energy, which is stronger than ever and plant construction in the manufacturing sector. Also institutional projects and big urban areas like Montreal and Dallas are seeing growth. And in more rural areas states like Oregon, the construction of datacenters represent a growing opportunity for us. Our specialty business in trench safety, power and HVAC had a very strong quarter with rental revenues up more than 40% year-over-year and an improvement in operating margin. Now some of that comes from our acquisitions in the trailing 9 months, but even excluding acquisitions, we still had over 24% growth in our specialty rentals.  ","It\u2019s good to see project activity pick up again. And it still has a long way to go but our customers are in a better place than they were a year ago, particularly our target customers. When we look at our key accounts and national accounts as segments of our customer base, the rental revenue growth for each group was higher than the company\u2019s 20% growth overall. ","And we talk to our customers all the time and are optimistic about this year. And this supports our belief that 2012 will continue to be a year of significant growth for us. Now, very soon we will have a much larger organization, putting momentum behind that growth. And we schedule our special meeting of stockholders for April 27 to approve the RSC merger, and we planned a closer transaction on April 30. Now, immediately after closing on what we call Day 1, we\u2019ll start communicating with all employees of both companies and move immediately into integration mode. The planning process of the past four months has been intense. Every detail has been scrutinized. Am very proud of the way we are handling this work load without taking our eyes off our customers. ","In a matter of weeks we will begin building on the strengths of each company to form the world\u2019s best equipment rental provider. United Rentals and RSC are both strong companies right now and are going to be even stronger united. And we\u2019ll open the door for greater creation of value for our customers and our investors and that has been our goal all along. And we are very close to acting on those opportunities. ","So, with that I\u2019m going to ask Matt to spend a few minutes on the integration and then Bill will cover our financial results and after that we\u2019ll take your questions, so over to you Matt.  ","Matt Flannery","Great, thanks Mike and good morning everyone. When the senior leadership teams of both RSC and United Rentals got together in early January, we were all ready in complete agreement about what would be our guiding principles for the integration process. These three principles were defined early on, as part of the decision to combine the operations. ","First, we would do view any and all changes through the eyes of the customer. Any lapse in customer service would be unacceptable. Second, we would be diligent about making sure we created the best in class organization for the new United Rentals. We wanted to make sure we retained the top talent and continued on with the best process for each business function. And third we committed to follow the money and look hard for synergy opportunities along every step of building our new organization. I would like to take a minute to tell you all how we\u2019ve gone about this process.","When Mike asked me to lead this integration, the first challenge that I confronted was at the most fundamental level. How can we pull together an integration team from both organizations without hurting the base business? Well, as you all read last night, both companies stayed on-track with strong first quarter performances despite the fact that we\u2019ve had over 100 people deeply involved in the integration planning and thousands of others more than little curious about the process.","We accomplished this through the efforts of our align management as well as productive communication from both (inaudible). From an integration process perspective, we organized our efforts into 14 functional and strategic teams. All focused on a specific area of the business. These teams have a total of 25 sub teams working to assist them. Each team is jointly led by the functional expert from each organization to ensure that the end result incorporates the best thinking of both companies. One example of this would be the go-to market strategy team. They\u2019ve been focused on sales, structure and customer segmentation. As a first step, the senior vice president of sales from each team reviewed the best practices from both companies. Then we had multiple field leaders from both organizations break out into sub teams. Each sub team is charged with focusing on a single component of the sales approach. By having the sub teams drilled down to the most basic customer touch points we\u2019ve been able to be very precise in identifying the challenges and opportunities that employees will face as the new United Rentals.","All of our field managers will be handed a sales playbook on day one after the close. The playbook will identify what issues may arise and how they should handle them in the field. We\u2019ve compiled similar playbooks for the business functions of operations, human resources as well as for all the corporate departments so that employees can be focused on keeping this a seamless transition for the customer. We want to be sure that everybody is on the same page.","While these teams are working on building the best process, they also continue to look for potential synergies. In other words follow the money. For the past 12 weeks each team has had weekly meetings to provide updates on the synergy opportunities they found and they would then report them to our Integration Management Office or IMO. The IMO evaluates each opportunity and gives guidance on how each potential decision would affect the business. In other words, is this synergy reasonable to attain. The IMO then reports out to our steering committee for final review every two weeks. We\u2019ve gone through this process methodically since February and we will continue to review opportunities long after this field is closed.","These efforts have resulted in each team preparing detailed action plan that has not only uncovered synergies in excess of our original estimate of 200 million, but have also helped us to identify best practice. For example, we are in agreement that RSCs total control system is the best way to help our customers manage their equipment usage. And the fast dispatch system used by United Rentals will help the combined organization operate its delivery vehicles in a more cost effective and efficient manner. Another area where we spend much energy is on the people selection process. We\u2019ve said throughout this process that we are focused on building the best team in the industry and I am pleased to report that the leadership teams from both organizations are very well represented. Earlier this month, we announced internally our field leadership team which includes 14 vice presidents heading up our branch network, 7 from RSC and 7 from United Rentals. We\u2019ll also have 4 senior vice presidents working in the field; 2 from RSC and 2 from United. And although having these numbers be identical was never a target. The need signifies the balance that we\u2019ll have in representation from each organization throughout our field network. And before I turn the call over to Bill I would just like to add that there is one thing I have learned in my 20+ years in the business and in the experience that I have gained with multiple acquisitions and to that success will be driven by the ability of the new team to work as a cohesive unit. For the past 4 months, I spend most of my time with the RSC and United Rental\u2019s employees doing just that working side by side getting prepared for this integration. And it is very encouraging to realize that we are much more alike than we are different. I feel confident that this alignment will help immensely in delivering a smooth integration process for our employees and our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Bill for the financial review.","William Plummer","Alright, thanks Matt and good morning to everyone. In the spirit of saving more time for Q&A my comments would be briefer than normal and let me start by reminding everyone of the change that we made in some of the key metrics that I\u2019ll be touching on here this morning. Effective, that the beginning of this year we adopted the ARA methodology for calculating certain key metrics, they include rental rates, time utilization, dollar utilization and fleet age. So, all my comments about the metrics here will be on the new ARA basis and year-over-year comparisons will have the prior period adjusted as well. So, let me start with rental revenue as always very strong quarter rental revenue as Mike pointed out. Rental revenues up 20.5% year-over-year and we had strong contributions from both rate and volume in that number Rental rates were up 6.3% for the quarter over the prior year and were on a sequential basis essentially flat, they were down 0.08%, so let\u2019s call that flat for argument sake. So all-in-all the rate environment was solid and fully consistent with what we expected for the early part of the year and indeed fully consistent with the 5% target that we\u2019ve laid out for the full year.","Volume was also strong. We were up 18% year-over-year in OEC on rent, up to $2.6 billion of OEC on rent, a very strong number for the first quarter. It obviously reflects the size of our fleet being larger. We spent a robust amount of CapEx in the first quarter and increased the average size of our fleet by 16%. But it also reflects nice performance on time utilization. Time was 52.3% and that was up 120 basis points over the comparable period last year and that represents yet another record for the quarter in the company\u2019s history. So, strong time on a larger fleet and getting the rate, it\u2019s a pretty strong combination, we are firing on all cylinders and it gives us great momentum on rental revenue for the early part of 2012.","The other part of the revenue story that\u2019s worth noting is the used equipment result for the quarter. We sold $76 million of proceeds of used equipment in Q1 and that\u2019s up robustly from $32 million last year. Combined with that huge volume though was the gross margin result that was very strong, 38.2% gross margin and while it down a little bit from last year the size what we sold was truly impressive. The real driver of that strong margin performance was our channel mix. We sold 68% of that total volume of used sales through our retail channel. It was combined with a robust pricing environment, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the channel mix is a major driver for us and so we were very pleased to be able to move that volume through our retail channel. A total of $147 million of OEC sold in the first quarter, another very strong performance for us in that regard.","Let me move briefly to profitability measures, anyway you cut it, again a strong quarter for us. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $231 million and that was up 59% over last year, $86 million more of adjusted EBITDA this year compared to last year and along with that a great performance on margin. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 35.2% and that was an increase of 750 basis points over last year. So nice performance on the top line, also good results in the cost of rentals and our SG&A performance as well, all of that contributed nicely in Q1.","On a flow-through basis, the adjusted EBITDA flow-through to total revenue was 64.7% for the quarter, again a robust performance and fully consistent with the range that we have given you for the full year of 62% to 65%.","EPS, again, another strong performance there. Adjusted EPS for the quarter is $0.36 of profit and that compares to a $0.32 a share loss last year. So, again, by any measure a strong profitability performance.","A couple of words real briefly on our capital plan for fleet and free cash flow for the quarter. On CapEx we spent $390 million of gross rental CapEx in the quarter. That\u2019s a very very strong CapEx performance on the company\u2019s part and I must say a strong performance on the part of the vendors as well. They were able to deliver a very large amount very rapidly in Q1 and certainly it was something that we wanted to take because we saw a very robust demand out there as you could imagine from taking $390 million of gross rental CapEx spend and still driving improvements in your time utilization in the first quarter seasonally weak. It\u2019s a pretty strong performance. So, $390 of gross capital spends in the quarter. The spend has been as we have done for the last and several quarters, focused more on those categories that we are interested in, in the particular Boom and Scissor lifts and Forklifts and we have got some more earth moving equipment coming in for the quarter. So a good spend quarter for us on gross capital.","Our free cash flow in the quarter was a usage of $89 million that compares to a free cash flow source of $70 million in the first quarter of last year. The swing certainly reflecting the larger capital spend that we have played this year.","Let me as a final couple of comments update our thoughts about our outlook for 2012. I\u2019ll reemphasize but these are standalone view of our outlook and obviously we will update the forward view of the company once we have closed the transaction with RSC. Our expectation is that we will offer some further guidance on the combined company in the middle of May once we have had a chance to take a closer look at some more detailed data from RSC. But for United Rentals, as it relates to rate, we are reaffirming the 5% rental rate improvement that we expect for the full year, and as I said before, our first quarter performance is clearly consistent with that level of improvement.","On time utilization, again we are sticking with the 0.5% improvement in time utilization for the full year that we had previously provided. And again, our first quarter experience is consistent with that kind of time, especially when you look at the pace that we have been bringing in new capital.","On capital spend, we are going to continue to target about $1 billion of gross capital spend for the year. Although now given the strong start on used sales proceeds we have reduced slightly the amount of net rental CapEx that we expect for the full year. We are now calling net rental CapEx in the $700 to $750 range, down roughly $70 million from where we were previously. I will point out that I have got a question or two from folks about whether that reduction in the net rental CapEx target without moving our free cash flow target for the full year does that imply any reduction in our outlook for profitability over the course of the year? The answer there is definitively no. We just are reducing the net rental CapEx to be consistent with what we have experienced and what we now expect in the way of used sales proceeds over the course of the full year.","Again, our free cash flow target for the year is unchanged, its $50 to $100 million free cash flow negative and again we think that\u2019s the appropriate level of capital as we look at the year currently. If we execute the CapEx plan at these levels we will improve the age of our fleet, over the course of the year, it will improve roughly two-and-a-half months over the course of the full year. We got roughly three months of improvement from the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter with the level of spend that we did and the level of robust used sales. So that will continue to play out as we go through the rest of the year.","On the profitability front, in terms of flow-through, we still think that flow through will be in the mid-60% range for the full year, call it 62% to 67%, again consistent with what we have said previously.","Finally, let me just offer one thought on the merger. As I said, we will be updating our view about the merged company in comments that we will make a couple of weeks after we have closed. But having just completed the financing transaction I just wanted to remind everyone of our view on one of the key measures as it relates to the capital structure our total leverage. Total debt-to-EBITDA we have said previously, we expect to come down rapidly. We have included in our investor deck a view of what that means. We show there on a pro forma basis for 2011, 2012, and 2013 the total debt-to-EBITDA leverage that we expect assuming the forecast that we included in the S4. So, on a pro forma basis with those forecast assumed, we would be something like 4.6 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2011, but that will come down to roughly 4 times by the end of this year and down further to roughly 3 times, 2.9 times to be overly precise, by the end of 2013. That kind of deleveraging is what we have in mind and what we think is appropriate and available to us on a combined basis.","With that I\u2019ll end my comments and ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Matt, can you talk about your updated cost cutting targets? I believe in slide 15 it looks like the branch consolidation number has moved significantly higher, I wonder if you could just step us through the change in branch plan and also touch on relatively lower share on the corporate side as well?","Matt Flannery","Well, as you could imagine, we had our original model back in November\/December time frame that we built out. I think at that time Bill had stated that we are going to have about two-thirds of our synergies were going to be realized in the first 12 months. As we have got into the process and started looking under the hood there is some puts and takes in some areas and you recognize one of them in the branch consolidation opportunity. We also think we can get some of that done sooner than the original model. So we have actually updated\u2013 the probably most significant update is we have updated our first 12-month, say to $147 million realized in the first 12 months and that was from about $132 to $133 million previous.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Matt, in terms of the timing you touched on to some extent is it fair to assume that the branch consolidation will be some of the faster moving operations, so is that the biggest driver of the increase to $147 million from $132 million or are there other factors that we should be thinking about?","Matt Flannery","I would say real estate overall we have been able to find ways to accelerate. There are no other major puts and takes but will continue to refine this and as Bill has stated there are some things we haven\u2019t been able to look at yet due to regulatory reasons and when we get into those after the close that we will might be able to incorporate some more detail into our mid-May update.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And Michael and Bill, can you touch on the CapEx sections that you are seeing out of your competitors? It\u2019s great to see you are putting the new fleet to work at very high utilization rates. For the first quarter here, I am wondering if you can comment on the range of CapEx increases that you are seeing out of your competition as well? I think we have been hearing up to 50% CapEx increases in the first quarter off of a low base for a lot of the smaller companies but we would love to hear your view on the landscape? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, Jerry, it\u2019s Mike. What we have been hearing \u2013 and from some various executives of some of our vendors is that they have been seeing a big pickup. It really came \u2013 the ARA has their first show in the first quarter and that\u2019s where there is a lot of traffic and they are seeing some upward activity. It\u2019s safe to say that I think that\u2019s a positive sign for the industry as a whole and also from United Rentals specifically we are well positioned because we have had our orders well in advance of making sure that we don\u2019t get squeezed by any lead times.","William Plummer","Yes, I think that a key point is that folks who are placing orders right now are going to face a much more challenging environment in terms of lead times. You have to understand what that means, when they will get the equipment and where it will put them relative to the seasoned. That\u2019s one of the things we feel good about is that we place pre-orders very extensively for the early part of this year. You see it in the CapEx that we realize in Q1. I\u2019ll mention something that I forgot to mention actually in my opening comments that as we look at our CapEx plan for the first half, previously we have said we would be spending about $600 million out of the roughly $1 billion of gross capital spend that we are going to spend this year. Our view now is that we will spend a little north of $700 million of that $1 billion in the first half and that reflects not only the pre-orders that we placed but also the relative strength of the vendor\u2019s performance. So we feel we are positioned well and yes, we are seeing some of the others place orders and the question is when do they get it and what does that mean in the marketplace.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Michael Kneeland","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hi guys, congratulations on the quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Thanks, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","I was hoping to touch on the rental gross margins and the incrementals, in particular, 84% on our math is very impressive relative to our expectations kind of history in the guidance you have given. Just wondering if you could give us as sense for what went on in the quarter that may have helped you hit those numbers and if we could possibly do the cost of rent bridge to understand the puts and takes in the quarter that would be great?","William Plummer","","Sure, Ted. So, clearly the impact of rental rate is something you always have to be mind full of in this business and we had a good rental rate performance on a year-over-year basis, up 6.3%, so that gives you a nice backdrop in terms of the contribution of revenue falling to profitability but in addition to that there were a couple of, I guess, I would say one-off items that you should be aware of in order to kind of make sense of it. One is, we had a several million dollars benefit from a recapture of bonus accrual from 2011. We accrued for bonus during calendar 2011 based on an assumption about what we would pay out. When we actually made our final decisions about payout in the first quarter, we ended up paying out less than we accrued. And so, we recognize that benefit as a bonus recapture in the first quarter, in cost of rent that accounted for, as I said a few millions bucks, call it $3 million to $4 million. So that helped, we have had couple of other sort of minor puts and takes. There was a one-time personal property tax benefit that we received that was close onto a million bucks that fell in to the cost of rent bucket as well. So that is another one timer that helped with the follow through in the Q1. The rest of the year-over-year variance in cost of rent, the great majority of it is driven by variable cost associated with higher volume. As I said, volume was up over 18% in the quarter and between repair and maintenance, and delivery expense, and fuel costs, and salaries and benefits associated with the incremental headcount, that really drove the great majority of the year-over-year increase, and as I said, offset by those two benefits, those one-time benefits that I pointed out.","So I think that\u2019s probably the way to think about it. A lot of volume related cost going up, as you would expect and as you want and then a couple of one-timers helping you out to give you that outstanding flow through. Is that helpful? We lost Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","Say it again.","William Plummer","","I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s useful for you, anything else?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","That is exactly what I was (inaudible).","William Plummer","","Great.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","And then on the SG&A side just similar, strong kind of leverage performances, I was just wondering, if you could talk about the quarter and how we might think about the rest of the year? And, I will get back in queue.","","","William Plummer","","Sure, so for the year-over-year in SG&A, the big drivers there, obviously wages and bonus accrual would be sort of several million dollars of that, let us say it was up $7 million, so let us say $3 million of it or so was wage and \u2013 excuse me. Total wage and bonus would have been closer to up 7 by itself, but I would point out there was a one-time headwind from that bonus recapture effect in SG&A. It was a tail wind of a few million dollars in cost of rent, there was little bit of a headwind of about a million bucks, if I remember correctly, about a million bucks in SG&A, but that combined with other wage and bonus accrual adjustments would have taken SG&A up about 7, volume related to commissions and other selling related costs would be up another 3, so now you are up 10 and then we had a very strong bad debt performance in the quarter that actually took that down to the roughly $7 million increase overall. There are a couple of other nits and nats that are kind of offset each other, but those were the big movers. So, wage and bonus and I will call it up 7, volume call it up 3, and then bad debt call it down 4 to get you to -- down 3 to 4 to get you to roughly the net up 7 that we reported.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","Okay that is helpful. And on a go forward basis I know it is going to change in a couple of weeks of the combined company but any kind of guidance, Mike would be willing to share with us?","Matt Flannery","","Go forward for these two cost lines.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","Yeah, well SG&A and then the two cost lines?","Matt Flannery","","I think, the couple of things to keep in mind is just the bonus accrual will flex with how performance plays out over the course of the year. So, we started out very strong, we are accruing to a little bit higher level of bonus than we expected in our original plan for the year and you have to watch that to see how it plays over the course of the remainder of the year. In cost to rent, you have got a trend of lowering the fleet age so there will be a benefit as we go through the year there from lower repair and maintenance expense, as a share of overall cost of rentals. So you have to keep that mind, there will be a little bit of a tail wind if we can keep the age trending down the way that we planned. Those are the things that come to mind right off. We have raises, marine increase is scheduled to take effect, that took effect at the beginning of April, so that will be on an absolute dollars basis, there will be increase of, call it 2.5% to 3% that flows through our both cost to rent and SG&A because of raises. So you have to make sure that you keep that in mind. Those are the things that come to mind Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","Okay, that is super helpful guys, congratulations and best of luck of this quarter. ","Matt Flannery","","Thank you ","William Plummer","","Thanks Ted.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Manish Somaiya from Citi, your question please.","Manish Somaiya -- Citi ","","Good morning everyone and my hearty congratulations as well. ","Matt Flannery","","Thank you","William Plummer","","Thank you","","","Manish Somaiya -- Citi ","","Couple of question, I guess since we have Mat on the phone, I guess particularly on the integration Mat, obviously, the slides are terrific as far as kind of laying out your thought process. But, as we kind of think about on the ground execution and with 2Q and 3Q being seasonally strong for the industry, how should we think about how much is going to get done over the next two quarters? Is it something that is going to have to wait till fourth quarter? And then, related to that how quickly do we expect to have the MIS systems aligned?","Matt Flannery","","Great questions Manish, I would say as far as the synergy timing, what we do expect to get in this calendar year will be more towards the back half of the year. We really need to use the second quarter to validate some of the assumptions we have made to take look and make sure that -- we want to be prudent. As I had stated in my opening comments, the most important thing is to make this a seamless transition for the customer. With that being said, whether it falls in the third or fourth quarter is not going to be managed output for us. As opposed to getting them done as quickly as we can, so that we can move with our operational best practices. So that will be my answer on the timing issue of the synergies. ","William Plummer","","The other question you have was on the IT, IT we are looking at a go live date Manish, somewhere between 60 and 90 days in close. ","Matt Flannery","","Yes.","Manish Somaiya -- Citi ","","Okay and then just two other quick questions, one is on branding, any thoughts on keeping two brands, one brand and then just on Tier 4, I know we have talked about Tier 4 equipment in the past, but now that we have more of that equipment in the field, may be if you can talk about what kind of pricing you are getting on Tier 4 versus non Tier 4? Are you getting more because certainly I mean you are paying more on Tier 4, so may be if you can just kind outline something\u2019s there for us? ","Michael Kneeland ","","Manish, I will handle the branding question and I will pass of the other part of your question on prices of the equipment to both Matt and Bill. But, branding is a great question, I want to make sure everyone understand that the name will remain United Rentals, but to me a brand is much more than just a name. It is about understanding and implementing a vision and getting collective of thoughts from our employees our customers and our investors. And once we collect an information, we will come forward at the appropriate time to voice and communicate what our vision and our statement will be going forward, but right day one it is going to be United Rentals and RSC, it will be plus United RSC and I will tell you that we have got, -- I assume this is what Mat talked about on teams from both sides. We have a gentlemen from RSC who is leading this up, going deep inside the organization and collecting some very very good information about the people\u2019s collective thoughts around both companies and I think that is the important. This is an opportunity for us, because it is a new phase of not only our company but I think of the industry to step back and take a look at our brand. On the question of pricing --","Matt Flannery","","Manish, was your question about whether we realized different pricing, different rental rates for Tier 4 versus Tier 3 units.","Manish Somaiya -- Citi ","","Yes, exactly that.","","","Matt Flannery","","No, the short answer. Although, I will expand a little bit, we are looking at segregating the assets for two reasons, not just for pricing reasons, but if we have a -- as the manufacturers are manufacturing a limited amount of Tier 4 and as you can imagine they face into the fleet will initially we a small percentage, we want to segregate them out to make sure that customers who have Tier 4 requirements on the project or in the states that they are in, that those assets are separated out, so they don\u2019t -- the worst think we could do is send a Tier 4 engine to a project or customer that doesn\u2019t need it. So that does give us the opportunity to separate them out from the rest of the category which then you would obviously look at how the pricing will play out. ","Manish Somaiya -- Citi ","","Got you, thank you so much, I appreciate it.","Michael Kneeland ","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your question please.","William Plummer","","Hey Scott","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Thanks Mike, good morning. I guess my first question would be, how do you guys feel with regard to visibility into the upcoming peak season and the full year from what you are seeing and hearing from the field on, just on projects and what is the visibility (inaudible)?","William Plummer","","I will talk about, what we, the visibility around the customers and I will ask Matt to talk more about projects and what he is seeing more of from a geography stand point. As you know, we have quality business reviews with all of our business segments and we go into depth about talking about what we are understanding and hearing from the customers. Similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, our first quarter results from all indications from our customers remains true 80% came back and said that they see 2012 to be equal to or better than 2011. So, we see that as being comforting, I will also tell you anecdotally, and all the quite comments I have had with customers. They are seeing the level of biding activity go up again and that is another healthy indication of the environment. As far as geography and projects Mat will you \u2013","Matt Flannery","","Scott as far geographically our growth has been very broad based in North America, we had all but four states showing year-over-year growth and the large majority of those have been double digit, as far as those states showing growth. And the four states that haven\u2019t shown growth are in the single digits and then in Canada, all but two provinces has shown growth so, the growth is wide spread, which is good news for us, they are coming from the sectors that you would imagine, the energy sector through power plants and oil and gas drilling, through manufacturing there is some large projects that are going on there like to Walker project and the BigThree[ph] are starting to invest back into their plants and even the commercial sector is up, right here in lower Manhattan, we have got five major projects going on with the four Freedom Towers and the 9\/11 Memorial as well as a path transportation upgrade, so the opportunities are pretty broad based. ","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Great, thanks, if I could sneak through into my last question, could you comment on the weather impact in first quarter, if there is, if it influences the second quarter at all? And then Bill, separately how should we model used equipment sales margins going forward? Thanks, that is it from me, I appreciate it.","Michael Kneeland ","","Excuse me, can you rephrase your first question, did you talk about the weather?","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Yeah, just weather, general question on how you think it influenced the quarter and will that have any influence on second quarter results.","Michael Kneeland ","","Weather is always one that and in particularly in the fourth quarter and first quarter is really any mans guess, as we go through it. As you know that everyone has noted that there was a very warm and dry winter across North America and has it benefited us? Absolutely. How can I quantify it? Very difficult. Do I think it is going to impact the project and our type of customer that we go after in the second quarter? No, most of those are well start up projects, they have to bring their steel, the steel is ordered well in advance, they just can\u2019t fast forward that that quickly. With regard to some of the smaller projects, yeah there are probably some projects that got longer term that probably came on board sooner, I don\u2019t see them ramping or taking away from the second quarter, given the demand that we are seeing and also we are bring in more CapEx because of the demand that our customers are expressing to us, so that is how we see it.","William Plummer","","And Scott on your second question about modeling used margins, I guess what we have said is that, if you go back over a long period, 10 years or so and exclude \u201909 and \u201910 which are obviously major upheaval years, our used margins have been in that high twenties kind of percent area over each of those years. Given the strong start that we had to this year, I think it is very fair to say that that will be a little bit higher than we normally have been we were last year, I think we realized for the full year used margins of 31 and change, 31.7% and I would have to guess that we would do that at least again this year as just a general statement to how to model it. So, I would say higher than our normal historic average, I will let you use your imagination for how much higher.","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Right, thanks guys great job.","William Plummer","","Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of from David Raso from ISI Group, your question please.","William Plummer","","Hi David","","","Operator","","David, you might have your phone on mute.","","","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","","Sorry, I am here, thank you. Two quick questions, first the progress you see quarterly on the rental rates in the fleet utilization to maintain those full year targets. I appreciate seasonally the rental revenue in the first quarter doesn\u2019t completely carry its -- say 25% of the year waiting, but specially on the fleet utilization, if we were positive 120 bps year-over-year in the first quarter and we are looking for 50 for the full year, can you walk us in that quarterly progression? Are you expecting the back half of the year, fleet utilization to be largely flat at that stage or how do you think that would do that progression?","William Plummer","","Yeah David, it\u2019s very clearly that as we get into the back half of the year, we are going to be comping really huge utilization quarter. So, we brought the year-over-year improvement down aggressively in the back half to reflect that very fact. So, we think half a percent, we can make without giving a specific year-over-year number by quarter. Yeah, it comes down pretty close to nothing as you get further out. And keep in mind obviously, the fleet is getting much larger and we are comping very strong utilizations last year, so in our view that is going to require us to put a huge amount on rent as we get that larger fleet in. And our belief is that the markets there, the demands there to be able to do that, but that\u2019s underlying the time utilization model. On rental rates and the progression there, the one way to think about it is, given what we did in the first quarter, we would need something like half a percent per month sequentially out through October and then basically nothing sequentially thereafter, in order to deliver the 5% full year. So, that\u2019s very clearly within the realm of reasonable and as always we are going to look for more if it is there. Does that help?","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","","Well, could you give us some color on how the rates were moving sequentially, I know there is some seasonality with the first quarter, but how much were rates up March versus February? How are we looking at April so far versus March? Just to see how that progression is playing out so far?","William Plummer","","Sure, so on a sequential basis, I would give you the sequentials and I would remind everybody that this is on ARA basis. The sequentials for January, sequential is down 6\/10th and then it went positive 3\/10th and then flat in March. And I guess, I would offer that April is -- the first half of April has been strong. Just to give you a comparison, if you look at last year, the sequentials in January were down half a percent and February up 2\/10th and March down 2\/10th, so the sequential progression this year is actually better than it was last year, when you think about the monthly sequentials, so that again gives us a lot of confidence that we are off on a nice run and that the 5% should be attained.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Then when it comes to CapEx, lets say your comment, first half of the year you\u2019ll be over 700 million of the billion growth lets call it 07\/10 for argument sake. It implies to back after the year CapEx is down 20% year-over-year. How shall I think about that in the sense of by the time we get to June how are you viewing the age year old t? Are you comfortable with that? Or simply look that is the map, it is right map, but we will obviously evaluate the CapEx when we get there. How shall I think about that back up CapEx implication.","William Plummer","You said it beautifully. I don\u2019t question the map, but we\u2019ve done and you\u2019ve seen us do it the last several years right. What we do is, we assess where the market is and where it is heading and how it feels and whether we can put more CapEx on rent at good rates and expect good returns over the longer haul and if and when we make that call we are not short about raising our CapEx guidance. I think we\u2019ve done it all three years that I have been here and so our plan is bring the 700 in the market certainly feels like it will soak that up right here now and then lets take a look around as we get toward the end of the second quarter and make a separate call about whether we should be raising the back CapEx expectation or leave it where it is.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And related to that question from my very last question, the CapEx\u2019s decision to bring the equipment in a little earlier, that may be the original plan in the first quarter. What drove that? I mean obviously you can answer the business was strong (inaudible), but safe from the supplier side or some of the dynamics that drove that decision and take the equipment a little earlier and if you could enlighten us like when was that decision made, I am not sure how quick your suppliers can respond to a change in that decision?","William Plummer","So, great question. We started placing pre-orders for the first two quarters in late last year and I think the first pre-orders that we placed we probably did in like September and that was the signal to our vendors that we were going to have demand, robust demand in the first half of the year. So, they started to position themselves to be able to deliver against those pre-orders as sort of a baseline of capacity. They did a nice job of ramping up their production capacity and they were able to supply fleet into us, quite honestly even faster than we had in our plan with the pre-orders. So, we asked ourselves can the market absorb more fleet faster than what we had thought and we concluded, yes it can and so we said yes if you can ship it we\u2019ll take it and that played out very nicely and resulted in the numbers that you saw for Q1 and what you\u2019ll see for the first half and it was a combination of the market being able to absorb additional fleet and the vendors being able to supply it and in us obviously being able to buy it. So, it all worked together to accelerate the CapEx.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Alright, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS. Your question please.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","Hey good morning guys.","William Plummer","Good morning Henry.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","You\u2019ve sold a lot of equipment over the last few quarter into the used market, just wanted you if you could talk about who is buying, it is generally staying in the equipments original home market or have you seen international buyers come in and clear it out of your serve market.","William Plummer","Michael, you want to say something.","Michael Kneeland","I am just going to say Henry, I actually attended one of the auctions, actually both of the auction. Actually, both of the auctions that the two large auction houses I had in February and the general feel I had and the comments I received back was at the offshoring of equipment actually went up significantly over the prior year. That\u2019s to me is a tell-tale sign. That demand is robust in other parts of the globe and the demand for our equipment which realistically, if you are looking for used equipment there is no better market than the US and North America, because it\u2019s still the largest producers of used inventory.","Matt Flannery","The who is buying question, as we said many times before it really is the who is who of people who use equipment, so wide range of folks. But I do think Michael\u2019s point is a very important one. Strong offshore demand I think is really supplementing demand that we are seeing from a wide range of customers here in North America.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","That\u2019s helpful. One follow up, could you talk a little bit about how far along do you think we are on the secular shift? And maybe, how does the new prospect look today compared with a year ago, cycle is picking up, have you seen an increase in enquires from potential customers who weren\u2019t renting before?","Michael Kneeland","Well, Henry, we have had this discussion and we have been talking with Global Insight with Scott Hazelton and as you know they have been commissioned by the American Rental Association to do some research. All indications that they have put forward based on a lot of data that realistically is very in depth, they are suggesting that the CAGR growth for our industry over five years is going to be somewhere in the vicinity of 12.5%. That\u2019s a pretty healthy number by any stretch of the imagination. When you asked about secular shift and what happens, I think that going into this year they are continuing to see that secular shift movement going in a positive direction. When the capital markets are wide open, when you asked them what has occurred historically the secular penetration doesn\u2019t decline, it levels itself off until the next downturn and then it actually goes back up again, continues its march upward. I don\u2019t think that that pattern is going to change and what we are seeing right here and now.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","Thanks a lot. Congratulations.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Matt Flannery","Thanks, Henry.","Operator","Thank you. Due to time constraints this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I would like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Okay. Well, thank you very much operator.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks operator and good afternoon, everyone and welcome. With me today, as the operator mentioned, is our CFO, Bill Plummer and other members of our senior management team.","I\u2019m going to start out with a quick recap of our fourth quarter results, which as you know, gave us a strong end to a very good year. And then we\u2019ll look forward to 2012. This is obviously an important year for us.","We have the RSC deal on the table and we also have a strong outlook as a stand-alone company. So, I want to focus on the fourth quarter metrics that serve as potential indicators for our operating environment in 2012.","For the fourth quarter, we reported rental revenue up nearly 19% compared to last year; rates up 6.7% on higher volume of equipment on rent; and time utilization of more than 70%, which is a fourth-quarter record for us, once again.","Now all of this contributed to an adjusted EBITDA that was significantly higher at $281 million, an increase of 55% over the fourth quarter last year. All these metrics tell a very compelling story about our ability to exceed the expectations created by our operating environment.","We know from the Department of Commerce that spending on non-residential construction declined slightly year-over-year in October and was basically flat in November. And yet, we were able to drive our revenues and rates higher and our time utilization went up on a larger fleet.","So here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. First, despite the external reports, our sales force is finding that customers are more active and optimistic than a year ago. Our own survey confirms this. So we think there is an early upswing that\u2019s not fully reflected yet in the government data.","Second, as we mentioned before, there is a secular shift towards renting and just this week several industry reports came out that support this. So there\u2019s no question that the recession is encouraging customers to rely more on rental and less on capital purchases. And once they make that shift, they saw that it could enhance their balance sheet and liquidity. And we believe that this is the most rapid penetration our industry has seen in a long time and we expect most of it to stick as the conditions improve.","And third, we think that we\u2019re getting a bigger share of pie. Changes in share can be difficult to measure our industry because it\u2019s so fragmented and largely private. But clearly, our segmentation strategy and customer service initiatives are working. And you can see it in our fourth quarter numbers. We had 21% growth in rental revenues from key accounts compared to last year, including 22% growth in National Accounts.","Key accounts were 55% of rental revenues in the quarter and National Accounts was 35%.","And rental revenues from industrial were up almost 20% year-over-year and if we remove the impact of acquisitions, industrial was up still a solid 17%. And we are at a point in the cycle where the better run, well-capitalized rental companies can outperform both the environment and the industry as a whole. And we expect to turn another good performance in the first quarter.","While it\u2019s all very positive, it\u2019s still a tricky cycle and we know that and we are managing the business very closely. But it\u2019s encouraging that we are getting the push in several areas. At the macro level, the leading forecasters predict a rebound in non-res construction of just over 2% on average in 2012 and about 6% in 2013. And this is supported by the architectural billing index, which came in above 50 for every month in the fourth quarter in our sweet spot the Commercial and Industrial sectors.","Now, if you compare that to the report from Global Insight, which you all know is the industry\u2019s leading forecasting firm. They expect our industry to grow about 5% this year with the majority of those revenues coming from rentals. So, demand for equipment rental services is forecast to outpace construction spending in 2012, just as it did this year. And once again, we are prepared to capture a good part of that growth.","Another encouraging sign is the fact that all of our regions continue to show year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, all of our regions saw double-digit growth with the exception of the Southeast and that was partly due to the capital decisions that we made.","We are also dealing with a bumpy demand both geographically and month-to-month. So our branches are doing an impressive job of implementing our strategy and driving results. Part of that strategy as you know is to constantly manage the productivity of our footprint against changes in the marketplace. We consolidated 28 branches in the year, 18 of them in the fourth quarter. We also acquired 16 branches and opened six as cold starts.","So, there\u2019s very little change in our branch count from January to December, but we made some important strategic shifts. Of the 16 branches we acquired in 2011, six of them have a strong industrial base. And of the cold starts, half were specially rental branches, meaning trench safety, power and HVAC.","Our specialty operations are growing at a fast pace with segment revenue up 45% in the fourth quarter. And we benefited from the energy boom and recovery efforts from natural disasters, but there is also an underlying trend toward more demand for power and climate control equipment. And we are also selling, cross-selling our fleet more effectively than ever before. So, specialty rentals are more than a niche for us, it\u2019s an important part of our growth strategy and you\u2019ll see us make further investments in this segment as time goes on.","Given the way we entered 2012 in high gear, we\u2019re very comfortable with the outlook we\u2019ve issued last night. Our expectations for 2012 are grounded in a solid and achievable plan Bill will discuss in a few minutes. But I want to call your attention to one number that is particularly indicative of our strength as a standalone company. Now, we\u2019re looking at gross rental CapEx of approximately $1 billion this year. Now I know that\u2019s a big number and we are not going to turn away business that is profitable and strategically sound. The fact is demand is there and our rates are still improving.","We drove more than six points of rate achievement in 2011 and as we said last night, we\u2019re projecting another five points this year. We are not a commodity; we deliver value in areas that matter most to our customers. And we\u2019re very focused on communicating that message as a basis for rates.","Now if the economy turns against us, we have the flexibility to adjust our CapEx and accelerate new sales. And we\u2019re becoming a much more disciplined company in that regard. And we will always continue to focus intently on customer service as to a way to achieve our targets.","Now, I should mention that the forecast excludes any impact from the RSC transaction and we will revise that after the deal closes.","So let\u2019s talk about the RSC deal. I know the announcement created a lot of buzz and rightly so. It\u2019s tremendously exciting. But I don\u2019t want it to overshadow what this company has accomplished and continues to accomplish as we march forward with our strategy. Yes, we\u2019re addressing the needs of the RSC transaction, but we\u2019re also continuing to think about new ways to serve the customers in the field.","Now for me, that\u2019s one of the things that makes this merger so exciting. United Rentals and RSC are both extremely well run companies and we\u2019re seeking to integrate the best of both companies into one incredible organization. Now just last week, Eric and I kicked off our first all-hands meeting in Houston, Texas. We had a total of about 60 people there representing everything from operations and IT to sales and maintenance.","Both companies came away from that meeting feeling very good about how closely our cultures are aligned. Now, I\u2019ve been involved in countless integrations for United Rentals both before and after becoming CEO. In fact, I came to this company through an acquisition myself. So, I\u2019ve developed a pretty good instinct for the planning process and the process with RSC is going well. And it\u2019s going to be as seamless as possible for everyone involved.","So when we get to Q&A, I\u2019m going to ask you to please respect the fact that we are limited in what we can share with you about the deal at this point. So as you know, we filed a preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC on January 17 and we understand that they\u2019ll have comments and we\u2019re prepared to address them. The forecasts in the S-4 reflect our view of how we would perform as a standalone company. And we\u2019re still comfortable with our estimate, as we discussed in December, that we should get about $200 million \u2013 in fact at least $200 million in cost synergies from combining the two companies.","With the Hart-Scott-Rodino, the 30-day waiting period, expired on January 20. So that\u2019s a major step forward in the process. And we did receive some requests for more information from the Canadian Competition Bureau, so the waiting period for Canada will be extended until 30 days from the date when all the requested information has been provided. So, as you can see, things are moving along and at this point we expect it to close in the first half of this year.","That\u2019s about it for updates. So let\u2019s use the Q&A for the best of our advantage this morning. In a lot of ways, we have a straightforward message for you today. We just came off a terrific year, and now we\u2019re entering into what will be a landmark year where we believe that we can excel both as a standalone company and in combination with RSC operations.","When we set a goal for this company, we pursue it, and we achieve it, and that\u2019s a matter of record. And now we\u2019re looking at bridging to well over $1 billion of EBITDA in 2012 at about 40% margin. And that\u2019s a source of pride for our employees and our leadership team. This company delivers on its promises. 2012 for us is not just about the deals that we can make or forecasts that are out there; it\u2019s about what we can deliver. So with that, I\u2019m going to ask Bill to review the numbers and then we\u2019ll come back and take your questions. So, over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone. Just to stay focused on the key points here, I\u2019m going to be very brief on the quarters \u2013 the quarter and full year numbers. You\u2019ve all seen those. I\u2019ll spend a little bit more time on the outlook, and then we will move to Q&A.","And I\u2019ll just reiterate some of Mike\u2019s comments to start out. It was a very strong year, a very strong quarter for us finishing up 2011. On rental revenues, that 18.5% year-over-year increase in rental revenue for the quarter was driven by a very nice progression in rate and volume in the quarter with rates being up, as Mike said, 6.7% year-over-year. Rates in the quarter were up 1.4% sequentially compared to the third quarter, which is a very nice progression in that part of the year seasonally. So, nice progression on rates in the quarter.","On the volume front, OEC on rent during the quarter was up 15.1% over the prior year, and it took us to a total dollar amount of OEC on rent of right around $3 billion. That\u2019s the second highest quarter ever in the Company\u2019s history of fleet that we had on rent, and it\u2019s second only to the third quarter in 2011.","Time utilization in the quarter was up 1.5 percentage points at 70.8% in Q4. And that represents the seventh consecutive quarter of record time utilization over the last seven quarters. So, just tremendous momentum on the time utilization front to go along with very nice rate progression as well.","When you look at the full year last year, just real briefly, rate \u2013 Mike mentioned that rates up 6.1% came in right at \u2013 maybe a touch better than what we had guided to after the third quarter. And that set us up very nicely for 2012 as well. With rates at that level, we have a carryover benefit in 2012 full year of about 3%, so a nice starting point for 2012.","For the full year time utilization was up 350 basis points, 3.5 percentage points to 69.1%, and that\u2019s another company record for the full year. So all-in-all, the rental story was very strong just across the board. It feels like we\u2019re firing on all cylinders. I get nervous when I say that, but it feels pretty good going into 2012.","The other part \u2013 significant part of the revenue story in the quarter was used equipment sales. We sold $93 million in proceeds of used equipment in the quarter. That\u2019s up from $40 million in the prior year. And that generated a pretty significant full year used sales proceeds number of $208 million, up from $144 million in the prior year. The especially good news though was that gross margins finished the year fairly strong for us both for the quarter and the full year. Just looking at the full year, our margin was 31.7 percentage points, and that\u2019s up 320 basis points compared to the prior year, and it\u2019s our strongest full year margin ever.","So, the used equipment story is very important to us because it\u2019s a vital part of how we\u2019re managing the fleet going forward. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of use that we need to continue to focus on in 2012 and in future years. So we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time thinking about the channel mix and in particular how do we enhance our retail sales contribution in our used sales. So we\u2019ll be talking about that more as the year unfolds.","On the profitability front, again, a very strong quarter, adjusted EBITDA came in at $281 million for the quarter. That\u2019s an improvement of $100 million or 55% compared to the prior year. And in fact, the fourth quarter EBITDA was basically flat with the third quarter EBITDA which, as you all know, is historically our highest seasonal quarter during the course of the year. Obviously, fourth quarter was enhanced by the used sales strength that we had as well as the $8 million self-insurance benefit that we had in the quarter; still a very, very strong performance for the quarter on adjusted EBITDA. Margin for the quarter came in at 37.7% and that\u2019s an increase of 740 basis points over the prior year.","So, when you look at the full year, we had a very nice result. The full year adjusted EBITDA of $929 million, that\u2019s a 34% increase. And the full year margin came in at 35.6%, and that\u2019s a 470 basis point increase over the prior year, and indeed it\u2019s a full year record for the company on EBITDA margin.","Flow-through was very robust. We had flow-through for the quarter of 67.1%, and that put us at 63.6% for the full year, well within the range that we\u2019ve been guiding you to of 62% to 67% for the full year. So, a nice result on the flow-through front as well.","And for those who like EPS, we had a very nice adjusted EPS result, $0.82 on the year. Obviously had some puts and takes, including the self-insurance reserve benefit of $8 million. But that was offset by a higher than expected tax rate. So, when we look at that $0.82, we think that\u2019s a good reflection of the strength of profitability that we delivered throughout the course of the fourth quarter.","Just a couple of key points on fleet management and free cash flow, we had promised $775 million of gross capital spend at our last outlook; we delivered $774 million. Combine that with the $208 million of full year used proceeds, that gives you a $566 million net rental investment in the Company for 2011.","And that spend, as we\u2019ve said again and again, was driven by us responding to what we\u2019re seeing from the market. So, it\u2019s very encouraging that we\u2019re able to put that much investment into the Company based on very strong demand. Certainly, time utilization for the year shows you that we\u2019re able to make the investment and still put the equipment on rent. So, very encouraged by that coming in to 2012.","On free cash flow, we finished the year stronger than even we expected. Free cash flow was $23 million for the full year, and that was really helped significantly both by the used sales effort at the end of the year but more importantly by collections which were very strong late in the year.","So those are the key points I wanted to make about Q4 and full year 2011. Let me spend just a few minutes on our 2012 standalone outlook. And again, it\u2019s standalone, not giving any effect for the transaction.","As Mike mentioned this outlook is fully consistent with the forecast that we put in the S-4 for 2012. So, if there is any question on anybody\u2019s mind about the difference between what we\u2019re seeing now and what was in the S-4, there is none.","On the revenue front, you saw in the press release that we expect rates to be up about 5%. And as I mentioned already, we\u2019re starting with a carryover benefit of about 3%. So, we think that we\u2019ve got a good foundation for delivering that 5% going through the year. And obviously, as we have for the last couple of years, as the opportunity presents itself to take more, we will drive more in rate realization.","On the time utilization front, we look to improve utilization by another 0.5 point or so for the full year. That would be another record year for us and to do that in the face of spending $1 billion of gross CapEx, we think it would be a very, very nice result on time utilization.","On the CapEx front, we are going to spend about $1 billion of gross CapEx and the net underneath that will be about $770 million to $820 million, that\u2019s the range that we\u2019re calling for. If we do that, we will drive up the average fleet size for the full year by $0.5 billion. The spend is going to be focused the way it has been for the last couple of years. We\u2019re going to respond to key customer needs and we\u2019re going to help to drive the fleet mix that we\u2019ve been driving and so we expect to continue to shift the fleet through our spend.","Spending $1 billion gross and selling what we expect to sell will have the impact of also reducing the age of our fleet. It should come down about 2.5 months over the course of 2012 on that plan.","Free cash flow for the year will be a use of free cash of anywhere from $50 million to $100 million. And on the profitability front, we think the flow-through that we\u2019ll realize in 2012 will be very comparable to what we realized in 2011. So, we are calling it mid-60s \u2013 for a range, we would say the same range that we gave you for 2011 between 62% and 67% adjusted EBITDA flow-through to total revenue.","Obviously, there will be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as you saw in 2011 on that flow-through. And we will certainly keep you up-to-date as we go through the year.","And finally, just to offer a couple brief thoughts on the first quarter of 2012 as you can gather from our comments, we\u2019ve got a very nice start on rate and time utilization so far through January in the first quarter. So, we expect the quarter to develop nicely for us.","There will be the normal seasonality. We haven\u2019t repealed the seasons not just yet. So, on the revenue front, we will see sort of a typical kind of decline due to seasonality and profitability will also show a typical type of decline due to seasonality maybe somewhat muted as we drive better utilization, put more fleet into the business and continue to realize price.","But all in all, the momentum is good. Things feel like they are headed in the right direction. And we are very encouraged by the way the year is kicking off.","So with that, I will end my comments and ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Henry Kirn of UBS. Your line is open.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","Good morning, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Good afternoon, actually. Thank you.","William Plummer","It\u2019s morning somewhere, here.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","It\u2019s been a long day. Last year, there was some volatility and incremental flow-through as we went from fourth quarter to first quarter and then throughout the year. Can you talk about your expectations for incrementals as we progress in 2012?","William Plummer","Sure. I mean as I said, we expect volatility in each quarter. It\u2019s a very sensitive calculation, so that\u2019s going to happen. We feel good about the way things will develop as we get into the more busy season, second and third quarter in particular. First quarter, the flow-through, you\u2019ve got to have some below the average in order to get the average if \u2013 somewhere above the average and first quarter is always a challenge on that front for us. So, I\u2019d say you probably could see flow-through a little bit lower than the range in the first quarter and then improving as we go through the year.","Keep in mind, the flow-through is going to respond to things like how much you sell and you use equipment in a given quarter relative to the rental revenue that you generate. That\u2019s a challenge in the first quarter. It will respond to things like the acquisitions that you do, right, when they came in last year and how that quarter comps with the quarter that you\u2019re in this year. That can be a little bit of a drag in the first quarter given that we\u2019ve started to add the acquisitions later on in the year.","So, those are the kinds of things that will flow through the flow-through calculation, if you will. And we\u2019ll point them out as we go through the year.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS","I\u2019ll respect that one question limit and pass the baton. Congratulations.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks.","William Plummer","Well, thanks. Thanks, Henry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Chang of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Peter.","Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year and another strong quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a quick question on the forecast. I mean you pretty much went through your 2012 expectations, but for the S-4, you also have 2013 through 2015 in there. And I was curious as to kind of what your macro assumptions were and what contribution you were expecting from higher pricing for those three years.","Michael Kneeland","Well, I\u2019ll give you what the macro environment and Bill can go into some of the other details. But the macro environment, as we have worked with all of the outside services that are \u2013 the IHS Global Insight and Moody\u2019s, Economy, McGraw-Hill, all the typical names that you would play out; the consensus is starting in 2012, it\u2019s up about 2.1%. Then in 2013, it goes to 6%.","And then, we also are working with the Global Insight, which as I stated in my opening comments, has been working very closely with the American Rental Association projecting what the growth patterns will be over the following years. So, those are the macro environments that we\u2019re working with. Keep in mind, we also tie that by talking to our customers and we will do that and continue to update as we go year-to-year. But I would say that that was probably the biggest macro environment that we were looking at.","William Plummer","And in terms of other aspects of those forecasts, I mean we certainly used our usual thought about what the value of incremental rental rate is. So, it will drop through at something like 97%, 98% for rental rate improvement. But we also thought carefully about the fleet additions that we would make over that timeframe and the impact of additional fleet to profitability, how we might drive time utilization across that timeframe and what that means to us; really all aspects of our business. And starting from that macro backdrop, we put in what we thought were very attainable goals for the next several years, we\u2019re not trying to dilute ourselves, we just wanted to tell the story that we thought was as close to accurate as we could and those are the numbers that came out.","Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a quick clarification, is it fair to say that starting in 2013, we are expecting I guess kind of like a decel to a low single-digit to flattish rental rate environment as the years go forward?","William Plummer","I\u2019m sorry, starting in 2012 you said?","Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse","2013.","William Plummer","2013. Yeah, the way we thought about rate over that time period was 5% in 2012, and then we trended it down to low single digits over the next couple of years. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we trended down from the 5% we assumed in 2012, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Yep. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso of ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, David.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Quick question about the S-4 progression on the EBITDA margins, again we\u2019re \u2013 excuse me, talking standalone company. The improvement that you see is obviously a little more significant 2011, 2012, but even from then on still getting a couple of hundred basis points. And I know there\u2019s a lot that can go into that beyond just the rental margin itself.","But how are you thinking about looking out a couple of years, the rental margin ex-depreciation, right? I mean, it used to \u2013 you know, high watermarks used to be 55, go back in the day maybe a little higher. But we\u2019re already at a pretty high level coming out of 2011. So, again, on a standalone basis, what are the things when it comes to the mix, the kind of accounts you\u2019re taking, how should we think about your target for the rental margin? Because the other things have a lot issues around your capital decisions, right? Some buying a lot of new, you can sell out a used, and so forth, but truly the core kind of business, the rental margin ex depreciation.","William Plummer","Yeah, David. I think rather than sort of talk about specific rental margins, I\u2019d just point to a couple of key aspects of our business that I know you know. We\u2019re putting fleet into our business in a fairly significant way over that period. And that\u2019s a very powerful lever for improving margins for us. So the amount of fleet that we\u2019re adding over the horizon is hugely important. That\u2019s point number one.","Point number two is that, what we just said with Peter, the rate assumption, while it does trend down over the next several years, we\u2019re still realizing rate improvement which as you know is a hugely powerful lever and generating better margin as well. So I think those are two very prominent aspects of how the margins of the business, overall rental included, will trend. And we feel comfortable that we can deliver that if the market demand is there to support that additional fleet. We believe it will be based on the macro backdrop that Michael just talked about. And so that\u2019s why we put together the forecast the way we did.","Michael Kneeland","Yeah, David, we\u2019re also trying to drive some efficiencies in the business. As you know, we\u2019ve kicked off fast. We\u2019ve got by the end \u2013 midyear this year, we\u2019ll have all of our locations up on that. We do believe that, using technology to further drive efficiencies, we\u2019ll be able to realize in the out-years.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Okay, I appreciate it. I was just \u2013 the S-4, you\u2019re already above 40% for 2013, next year, and then in the north of 43% in 2014. So I was curious, obviously the new machine gets it on the depreciation line, your maintenance goes down with the new machines. So I could see why the new machines obviously create a better rental margin. I was just curious if you had any color around how you thought about the mix of business, maybe deemphasizing aerials in the fleet. Just trying to think about cycle to cycle, the configuration of the accounts and the fleet size and the type of fleet might be a subtlety on why the margins can be better at the rental level cycle to cycle. I was just trying to flesh out some of those items that might show a difference between the companies cycle to cycle?","William Plummer","Yeah. I think our general assumption is that we can continue maybe at a somewhat slower rate, but continue to trend in the customer mix that we\u2019ve established, growing with the larger players who we believe offer us a better profit opportunity. So we continue to trend in that direction, continue to trend more toward industrial in that mix of customers.","As for the fleet, again, we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying that we\u2019re going to continue to trend to a slightly smaller aerial share of the overall fleet and grow in some of the other areas. Some of those other areas are the specialty businesses like trench and power and HVAC. So, those will contribute very nicely as we go forward. So I think those are the things that I would call out as part of that longer-range forecast that we believe supports the margin trends that you see there.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","No, I appreciate that. I mean there is a difference between saying we\u2019re just going to run the company more efficiently, which hopefully you will, it\u2019s a higher hurdle rate to jump over than simply \u2013 the mix, it\u2019s just more advantageous to have a higher rental margin, thus the idea of doing a 40%-plus EBITDA margin or a higher rental margin in the last cycle is \u2013 it\u2019s not quite as high a hurdle rate in the investors\u2019 mind, so. Okay. No, I appreciate it. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Joe.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","William Plummer","Hey, Joe.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","A question for you on the competitive environment. One, can you maybe just comment on the health of some of your independent regional peers? And two, because I think most of them are also fully utilized, do you think that 2012 could actually be a better year for you in terms of share gains?","Michael Kneeland","Well, Joe, this is Mike. We have our plans. We laid it out. We\u2019ve \u2013 as Bill was saying, we put a lot of \u2013 set of assumptions. Could it always be better? Yeah. It could be. When you look at the landscape, as I mentioned, the well-funded, the larger companies I think will outperform the industry as a whole. And you are right; I think time utilization has kicked up for everybody. But I think that the credit market is still restricting a lot of growth and that bodes well for the larger organizations.","So is there an opportunity? Yes. Our strategy is to focus on profitable growth and be selective of the customers that we\u2019re going to choose, and also expanding our trench, power, HVAC side. So, yes, the answer is, could it be? Yes.","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll hope back in queue.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I apologize in advance, just out of habit I\u2019m going to have a multi-part question. But, with \u2013 Bill, mostly for you, with regard to CapEx, could you discuss timing throughout the year since it\u2019s such a large number this year; implications of how the RRR transaction might make you rethink that, and then just a reminder of your supplier commitment and rates that you have locked in with them? Thanks for the run-on.","William Plummer","Sure. So on the timing of CapEx, we\u2019ve talked about looking at the year, and 2012 is a year of two halves, with the first half being fairly hefty amount of spend. We\u2019ve talked about something like $600 million of the $1 billion would be spent in the first two quarters of the year. That\u2019s our thinking as we sit and speak right now.","And based on the commitments that we\u2019ve gotten from the vendors, and indeed based on the receipts that we\u2019ve had so far in the month of January, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any issue with getting that much fleet delivered in the first half. So that\u2019s the first half; the second half would be the remainder.","And as we said, though, we\u2019re going to evaluate how the market develops to make sure that it warrants spending that second half roughly $400 million or so. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the timing.","As to the impact of the transaction, we \u2013 it\u2019s really too soon to say the specific amount of impact on the transaction. We are going to evaluate what their capital plan is, what our capital plan is and where there might be opportunities to realize some benefit managing the two as one. My guess sitting here right now is that there will be some impact, but it\u2019s going to be pretty small in 2012 is my guess. And that\u2019s the way we modeled it as we modeled the acquisition to set the valuation. So I would say pretty small impact to the overall spend in 2012.","As to the suppliers, I\u2019m sorry, Scott, I\u2019ve forgotten, what was your question around the suppliers?","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","Just negotiated rate going into the year with the suppliers.","William Plummer","So, we\u2019ve been very focused on mitigating the impact of inflation, as we always are. If you exclude the Tier 4 purchases that we do, the rest of our purchasing will come in in the low single-digits in terms of inflation over last year. The Tier 4 units, depending on the manufacturer, will cost more. There\u2019s just no avoiding it. That\u2019s partly though why we wanted to try and pre-buy a significant amount of our fleet this year as well. We were able to place orders that take advantage of run-on production under the old Tier 3 rules, and so that has helped mitigate any impact of our capital spend \u2013 of inflation on our capital spend. So ex-Tier 4 in the low single-digits inflation, very low single-digits I would say. Does that help?","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","Yeah. Great. Thanks and congratulations.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Emily Shanks with Barclays Capital.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Emily.","Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi. How are you, guys?","Michael Kneeland","Very well.","Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good. Congrats on a great quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital","My one question is just around the 4Q rate coming in better than your forecast and your thoughts around that. I\u2019m specifically curious if there\u2019s anything of note going on on the competitive front and\/or is it just simply demand, and with that secondarily if you could comment if you are seeing any improvement from some of your competitors? I know it seemed as though they had fallen off in the summertime.","Michael Kneeland","Yeah, Emily. This is Michael. My sense would be is, we are the first to report and if you look at historically what you have been hearing from all of my competitors who are public; they have all publicly have come out with improvement on rates, so my sense is that that trend will continue.","I have said this before, and I will say it again, rates is a powerful lever within our industry. And if you look over the last several years, all of our rates came down quite a lot. And the fundamentals of getting over your cost of capital hasn\u2019t changed and so my sense is given the high time utilization, given the fact that the Tier 4 engines and Tier 4 products are going to cost more, it\u2019s going to behoove all of us to make sure that we get the right return on all of our assets.","So my sense will be given what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, it should continue. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see but, again, my sense would be is, as you hear other companies come out publicly I would not be surprised to see their rates up as well.","Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great. Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Pease go ahead.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hey. Thanks, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Hey.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","How are you doing?","Michael Kneeland","Good.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Congratulations on another great quarter.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","I just wanted to tag on to David\u2019s question, and take it one step further and go in the direction of returns. And I know one of the big things you guys have really tired to emphasize is \u2013 is improving the full cycle returns on invested capital.","William Plummer","Hey, Ted. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m having a hard time hearing you. Can you get a little closer to the phone?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Sure. Is that any better?","William Plummer","Yeah. That is.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Oh, great. Sorry about that. So what I was hoping to do was talk a little bit more about your returns on a go-forward basis. And I know one of the big internal pushes has been to improve the full cycle returns. And so, given the inflection that we\u2019ve seen in the business, I\u2019m just wondering if you can update us on how you think about returns over this upcoming cycle, both on a standalone basis and to the degree you can talk at all about the pro forma that would be great as well?","William Plummer","Yeah. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m rapidly scanning my brain trying to think about how to talk about the returns and not be flippant and say something like returns are going to go up. We\u2019re certainly focused on the elements of return. And we certainly, over the forecast horizon that we put in the S-4, improve our returns. They\u2019re going to come out of the usual suspects, right, improving rate, being more efficient with the cost side of the P&L, leveraging your fixed costs in particular over a larger fleet. We think we get better profit improvement than the increased average size of the fleet in the forecast horizon that we\u2019ve put out there. So \u2013 maybe if you ask a more specific question, but overall we think that there is a very nicely trending path of returns over the next several years and it\u2019s just up to us to go out and get the elements that lead to that trend in returns.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Asked maybe differently, could you speak to specific numbers about your targeted returns on invested capital, maybe that will be implied by the forecast you had in the S-4 and what that might mean cycle-over-cycle, will the average return would be for the company?","William Plummer","Yeah. No, I wouldn\u2019t comment on a specific targeted return that\u2019s in the S-4 forecast. Maybe I\u2019d just drop back to say that we\u2019re very firmly committed to the idea of delivering cost of capital returns over the cycle. And we think about our cost of capital as being something like 10% as a target. So I\u2019ll stop there without getting more specific, but we feel good about the trend that we have toward that goal of delivering cost of capital returns over the cycle.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. That\u2019s great. Well, congrats again, and best of luck this year guys.","Michael Kneeland","Yeah. Thanks, Ted.","William Plummer","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC. Your line is open.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Seth.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Afternoon.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC","Kind of conceptually, I just want to throw something out there. I mean as the commercial construction cycle gets better, would you expect the \u2013 your construction bucket to outgrow your industrial bucket going forward, just have a faster growth? And then, what would the implications for margin be? I know you\u2019ve talked about I think industrial margins being actually higher, fewer transactions, what have you, so can you just \u2013 maybe as the market get \u2013 as the cycle gets better, how we should be thinking about that?","Michael Kneeland","Yeah. Seth, basically what we\u2019ve been saying is we\u2019re looking to diversify our portfolio. And to your point, around industrial, the dynamics around industrials are typically larger. They rent longer. They have the equipment out for longer periods of time. Those same dynamics you could fit into the larger national accounts spread across North America. So, we said we wanted to expand our portfolio to be somewhere in the 30% to 40% range of industrial. And I mentioned on the December call that this transaction with RSC gets us to where we want to be.","And I think that when you \u2013 we look at industrial, industrial recovers first, and it\u2019s less cyclical. We can park 2009 for a moment because it affected almost anything and everything that was moving. But in a typical cycle, it\u2019s more resilient. But in a recovery, as you can imagine, production goes up and industry goes up, first, and then you see construction kind of lag behind it. And, my sense is you\u2019re going to see that again here. So, when I look at it, we want to make sure that we have a blend, but it\u2019s more the type of customer that we are focusing at inside of construction that I think is the difference today versus yesteryear.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC","Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, okay. So even though the construction \u2013 commercial construction is getting \u2013 accelerating, the customer profile is different than it used to be?","Michael Kneeland","Yes.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC","Okay. And then I guess just \u2013 on the acquisition front, does the RSC transaction preclude you from doing other deals in your mind? I mean, you\u2019ve had some good success picking off some of these specialty operators. Do you think you\u2019ll continue to do that? Or just get too distracted with the RSC deal?","Michael Kneeland","Well, let me just say this, that we\u2019re razor-focused on the RSC deal and getting that done and completing that. Having said that, as I said, we\u2019ll continue to look at the opportunities that do exist in our specialty business. We see that as a unique opportunity for growth. And more importantly, there\u2019s a connection of cross-selling between our current customer base and those lines of business. So, we will be cognizant of what\u2019s available out there, but we\u2019ll also look at it from a cold start and also from a capital allocation for assets. So, it\u2019s all the above on our specialty, but clearly I want to make a point that we are focused around the integration process of RSC and United Rentals.","William Plummer","Yeah, just if I could; that \u2013 the integration process will certainly be a major focus, but we want to make sure that we\u2019re seeing opportunities and put those opportunities in the context of everything that we\u2019ve got going on. So, integration and, as Mike mentioned, our capital structure and how we allocate capital. That won\u2019t be lost on us and we\u2019re going to be very protective of the capital structure to make sure that we do good work on the capital structure over the early part following the acquisition of RSC.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC","Got it. Thanks very much, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wells with Thompson Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, David.","David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So, my question is if I look at the industry data flow out of the company, you had your survey results from August and September that were positive, and then we\u2019ve had a really nice run of positive weather here. And, what I\u2019m trying to get at is: we\u2019ve got some signs that the market is looking good.","But, my sense is what\u2019s the risk that that\u2019s a head fake to some extent, and another year where the macroeconomists come out and talk about a recovery in construction, and we had the same thing happen last year and it didn\u2019t really happen in 2011. So maybe could you steer us to what\u2019s giving visibility to really make the big wager on CapEx that you\u2019ve made in the first half and maybe even any data points here over the last, say, six to eight weeks that give you the confidence and visibility to put the big roll of the dice, so to speak?","Michael Kneeland","Well, I look at it \u2013 it\u2019s a little more scientific than rolling the dice. But, as we went through the year, our time utilization consistently quarter-over-quarter was at record levels. And, as Bill mentioned, we are seeing that play out going into this year as well. But, when we talk \u2013 it\u2019s about our customers and the way in which we go to market and we\u2019re focused with our customers and we\u2019re more connected with them than we ever have in the past. And, again, they\u2019re more optimistic. It\u2019s the work that they have in front of them.","And, we also take a look at where the opportunities existed, but because of our process and the way in which we planned last year, we could have grown. We\u2019ve been mentioning quarter over quarter and \u2013 with investors that we could have spent a lot more money last year, but we were very disciplined, and we wanted to achieve certain hurdles which we have overcome.","As a result of that, even if the market were to play out at flat, forget the 2% for a moment, take a look at this past year. The market declined, and we had significant double-digit growth. I think it still plays out that the uncertainty in the marketplace, coupled with the capital \u2013 or the credit market tightness still \u2013 the secular shift toward renting is continuing that momentum. So, we have something else at play here than just the macro environment.","William Plummer","Can I just add one thought? Maybe it\u2019s a little too granular; but one of the things that gives me comfort is not only to hear our customers say how encouraged they are about this year and the next few, but then to dive deeper into some of our tools like our job board and actually look at the projects that those customers are on, right?","And, you look at XYZ customer is on an airport expansion; well that\u2019s going to run for a couple of few years. Another customer is on a new power plant construction project; that\u2019s going to run for a while. Here\u2019s a hospital over here; here\u2019s a school expansion over there. So when you scratch the projects that folks are working on, it just feels like there\u2019s something real and substantial underneath. The overall tone that we get is that there\u2019s a solid year coming up. So that\u2019s one of the things that I look at.","David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research","Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Yeah, on the RSC acquisition, to the extent you\u2019re comfortable commenting, can you just talk about, if the acquisition is approved, how much upside to your utilization rates should we think about from the RSC Total Control system? And, can you comment on whether you would ultimately expect the revenue share for the trench and HVAC businesses for the combined company to be similar to where you are on a standalone basis today?","Michael Kneeland","Yeah, Jerry, let me just say that, as I mentioned, the integration process is well underway. We just kicked it off. Individuals from both companies are looking at a way to launch the new combined organization.","But, also at the same time, I want to emphasize that operationally we are two distinct companies until such time that we get all the approval and votes and we close. So, we are conducting ourselves accordingly at all levels. That being said, we do have a team that is dedicated for just what you just talked about and many more. It\u2019s made up of both sides. I will tell you the operating principles that we are working under, I think, are the key takeaways. We are looking at it through the customer\u2019s eyes.","How do we affect the customer? And, we\u2019re looking at integration of the best of both worlds. And, there is a lot of things that RSC does great and there are some things that we do as well. So, the question is, how can we get both of those married up and put together and that\u2019s what these teams are focused on. Bill talked about and I mentioned about following the money and making sure that we deliver on at least that $200 million. But, then the last one is communication and we have to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to communicate as we come through and find these answers. But, it\u2019s too early. We just kicked it off but you just mentioned the one thing that they have that quite honestly is a valuable asset to them. We just don\u2019t know yet at this point.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about fleet age in this cycle compared to the last cycle for your stand-alone business? I appreciate it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s more of a byproduct of your capital allocation decision than a target in and of itself but I would appreciate your broader thoughts if you don\u2019t mind.","Michael Kneeland","Well, sure. And, I\u2019m going to ask Bill to chime in as well. But, what we have experienced during this downturn is our ability to actually achieve record time utilization while improving our rental rates on the older fleet. And so, we\u2019ve pressure tested our theory, and we seem to be able to operate a lot \u2013 just fine at record levels on the older fleets. So, I think we will probably do some reevaluation to better understand that. As Bill mentioned, with the capital that we\u2019re spending, we will drop our fleet age down over time and starting this year. But, to say what is the optimum area, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we still have to refine that because, like I said, this downturn opened our eyes.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","And, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kneeland. Sir?","Michael Kneeland","Okay. Well, thank you, operator. I think this is a good time to wrap up the Q&A. And, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And, also I suggest that you download our latest investor deck that we\u2019ve got posted on our website. It has our full year numbers and also some additional information.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thanks operator. And welcome and good afternoon everybody. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. ","These first quarter calls are always about the future in the past and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 2015 for two reasons. First, it was a solid year for us with some excellent results, and as I will discuss, it says a lot about how we're managing the business. And second, we saw some trends emerge in 2015 that are likely to impact the current year. ","I will start with the operating environment. It offers some challenges although the underlying foundation of the recovery remain positive. We capitalized on some broad-based opportunities such as the continued rebound in commercial construction and we saw lively demand from some sectors such as hospitality, renewables and public works. At the same time we dealt with a significant drag for upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effect. A weak Canadian dollar and fleet growth in the industry, which according to Rouse is outpacing demand. ","Nonetheless, for the full year of 2015 we delivered a record amount of adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and a margin of 48.7%, which is the highest in our company's history. And our free cash flow came in at $919 million after CapEx which was also a record. These numbers tell a good story to show how we can be flexible and adjust our tactics while delivering value for investors. ","So as we look to 2016, the headwinds are still with us. There are also some evident macro constraints such as pressure on industrial activity, the Canadian economy as well as some unknowns. But underneath these dynamics, the non-residential construction markets are continuing to recover. And that's a key point. ","The equipment rental industry is continuing to grow. That\u2019s why if you asked me where we stand on our operating environment, there\u2019s really two answers to that. One has to do with the short-term, meaning 2016, and the other is longer-term relating to the rental cycle. Short-term, our stance is to be cautious on CapEx and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas, such as specialty services. And I will talk more about specialty in a minute. ","For the company as a whole, we think that our 2016 revenue can range from roughly $1 million [ph] to $200 million on either side of last year's performance. And this includes a significant negative impact from FX as Bill will discuss in a moment. And it takes into consideration the continuing drag from the Canadian economy on our performance. Canada is a commodity-driven country with economic issues that go deeper than Alberta and the oilsands. Real GDP growth in Canada this year is projected to be less than 1%. And as the largest rental company in Canada, we\u2019re going to feel some pain, and it could be significant. But we\u2019ll do what we can do to mitigate the impact on rates and utilization through fleet management. ","Now with rates, for the company overall we\u2019re projecting a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2%. We\u2019ve moved rates higher for five straight years and we\u2019ve maintained a premium price for our services, and sometimes I can make our rates more vulnerable to pressure in the short term. But rate integrity is the best long-term strategy for value creation. ","With utilization, we\u2019re guiding to approximately 68% which would be an increase of 70 basis points. We see improvement coming from our disciplined management of CapEx and OEC rent, a continued recovery in non-residential construction spending, secular penetration and the absorption of fleet excess in the industry. ","What our outlook doesn't show is timing and that\u2019s a big part of our 2016 plan. We\u2019re going to be very careful about the rollout of our CapEx. In the first quarter, we expect to spend less than half of the CapEx we spent in last year's first quarter. The CapEx we do spend will be focused on growth sectors and key customers. And from there we will test the waters. Full year plan is for approximately $1.2 billion of gross CapEx and we have the flexibility to move that number up or down based on the data that we see from our operations. ","So now turning to the longer term. Beyond the current market uncertainty, we agree with the industry forecasters that there are multiple years of growth ahead for rental in North America. The latest projection from Global Insight is about 6% annual growth in construction and industrial rentals through at least 2017. And we\u2019re seeing levels of customer activity to support this view. That point can't be lost when revenue flattens out for reasons I mentioned earlier. ","So it's important to note that our actual -- market activity is solid and in many cases trending upward. And our customers are on a whole optimistic. So I\u2019ll give you a few examples. Our Southeast region had a strong finish to the year. The activity is coming from mix of sectors, including automotive plants, infrastructure and amusement parks. ","On the West Coast, commercial construction is going strong along with renewable. Our Pacific West region has launched some business on a number of solar projects. And more universally, we\u2019re on large multiyear construction projects in industries ranging from ag business to biotech, to hotels and to sports arenas. The real standouts continue to be our specialty services of Trench Safety and Power & HVAC. For the full year combined these services increased our rental revenue by 21% and a healthy 16% of that revenue increase came from same store. ","We will continue to invest in fleet and coal storage for the specialty operations as well as our pump business. We\u2019ve been expanding our pump footprint in new geographies and diversifying our customer base beyond upstream oil and gas, and we expect to realize some benefits from these actions in 2016. ","Specialty service is an important part of our game plan for value creation. But when I speak to investors one-on-one, I often caution against thinking specialty as a standalone business. It\u2019s true these are high margin operations in their own right but their greater value lies in the holistic view of the company and specifically in cross-selling. We cross-sell our specialty services to national accounts to create stickier customer relationships, compete more effectively on major contracts and earn a larger share of the wallet. ","In 2015, we generated 22% more revenue from cross-selling versus the prior year, and we believe there\u2019s significant more financial benefit to be realized. This is just one area of the business that we\u2019re operating more effectively. In 2015 we also performed at a record safety level. We became a more technology enabled company. We\u2019re even better at change management, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in improving our rental process and service capabilities. And our employees are incredibly engaged in our company's future. All these are important attributes that matters to customers. ","And finally, I want to make a comment about our liquidity. We generated over $900 million of free cash flow in 2015, and we do expect to create about the same or more in 2016. We plan to utilize this cash flow to buy back shares and pay down debt this year. And these are the most prudent uses of our cash at this time.","So in closing, I want to emphasize that while 2016 contains some unknowns, we\u2019re absolutely certain about our ability to manage through any volatility. 2015 didn\u2019t always go according to our plan but it was very profitable for us. We executed on our strategy. We showed discipline as an organization. And this year we also showcased our resilience and flexibility we have in adapting to change in order to drive returns. These qualities will serve us well in 2016 when we expect to deal with some ongoing challenges. And they will serve us equally well in the longer term as we benefit from a rental cycle that has still years of growth ahead. ","So with that, I will \u2013 shifts this over to Bill for the financial results and then after that we will take your questions. Over to you, Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone from me as well. I\u2019ll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you\u2019ve all seen, starting with the revenue picture. Rental revenue in particular \u2013 rental revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus last year, that's about $42 million of revenue decline. The pieces of that really start with re-rent and ancillary. Those two combined were little better than flat, so call it up half a million dollars, the net of those two components. The real driver in the change in the quarter was OER growth. Within that, rental rate down 1.8%, that was about a $21 million decline versus last year. ","Our volume increased 0.2%, accounted for about $3 million of improved revenue year-over-year, that's a plus year-over-year. Inflation \u2013 CapEx inflation cost us about $19 million, little more than $19 million versus last year and then everything else, mix and all other components aggregated to a decline of about $6 million year-over-year. So those are the key pieces of that $42 million rental revenue drop in the quarter and explains the 3.2% decline from last year. ","One other operating measure within that year-over-year rental revenue performance was time utilization, 68.2% for the quarter was down 2.4 percentage points for the quarter. I\u2019ll point out that, that does include the impact of Canadian currency translation of the fleet on rent in the volume component. ","Speaking of Canadian currency, the impact in the quarter for the currency was very significant. Canadian dollar cost us $22 million versus where we would've been had it stayed flat. So a pretty significant impact in revenue growth for the quarter. ","And just one real quick note on the full year rental revenue, $4.949 billion, up 2.7% last year. I'll note that that also included the impact of the currency headwind. Currency in the full year period cost us $78 million versus unchanged currency. So a very significant impact in the full year as well. In fact, if you excluded that, our growth rate would have been as high as 4.3% for full year rental revenue as opposed to the 2.7% that we reported. ","On used equipment, we generated $157 million of used proceeds in the quarter, that\u2019s basically flat with the prior year and the adjusted gross margin came in at 46.5%. That margin is down from the prior year by about 2% but it\u2019s still very strong relative to the margin that we\u2019ve achieved in our long history. And I think that reflects the fact that we've been very focused on driving as much of our used equipment sales activity through our retail channel as we could. ","In the quarter, retail accounted for 77% of the proceeds that we realized and that\u2019s the highest share through the retail channel that we've achieved in a number of years, probably going back to before the last downturn. So we feel good about the overall used equipment result that we drove in the quarter and in the year and look for the used equipment market to continue with robust pricing and momentum here in the near term as well. ","On the profitability front, starting with adjusted EBITDA, it was $744 million in the quarter and came in at a margin of 40, that\u2019s a $31 million decline or 70 basis point decline in the margin. The $31 million versus last year is made up as follows. Rental rates cost us about $20 million in EBITDA whereas volume was a positive of about $2 million over last year. ","CapEx inflation was about a $14 million reduction versus last year and that used sales margin in dollar terms cost us about $5 million versus the last year. Our usual merit increase impact of about $6 million of reduction in EBITDA came through in the quarter. And then we had the biggest positive in the quarter year over year as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the year was our reduced incentive compensation accruals, that was a benefit of about $19 million. ","Bad debt expense was about $2 million of the headwind versus the prior year and everything else aggregated to $5 million headwind versus the prior year. So those are the key components of the $31 million of EBITDA change in the year. ","I will also point out that spread throughout a number of those lines was the impact of currency. It all aggregated to about $8 million of headwind from currency on a year-over-year basis to bring us to that full year \u2013 excuse me -- that quarterly number. ","For the full year, just real briefly, our adjusted EBITDA of 2.832 billion was an increase of 4.2% and that included an unfavorable currency impact of $29.3 million for the full year, so again currency was a pretty significant impact. ","On flow-through. Adjusted EBITDA flow-through for the company finished the year at 86.4%, but I will point out that, that includes the impact of the lower incentive accruals, that was a benefit as well as the impact of the currency change year over year which actually sounds bizarre but it also was a benefit to flow-through as well just given the impact \u2013 the separate impacts on revenue and EBITDA. If you exclude both currency and incentive comp, the flow-through calculates out to 65% for the company and that's probably consistent with the roughly 60% that we guide to or guided to for 2015. ","Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.19 and that was essentially flat with the prior year. I will point out, however, that on a year-over-year basis currency was at play [ph] in the adjusted EPS number. It costs us about $0.02 in adjusted EPS. ","We also had a significant tax law change that was finalized in the fourth quarter in the state of Connecticut. Lots of detail around that but when you net out the impact of that tax law change, it costs us about $0.06 versus last year. And then I\u2019ll also point to the mix shift between the US and Canada. Canada took a smaller share of our income in the fourth quarter and actually indeed [ph] over the full year in 2015. So if that mix shift had not happened, we would've been better by $0.02 as well in the adjusted EPS number. So keep those three things in mind as you think about the quarter EPS. ","Same with the full year, $8.02 adjusted EPS for the full year. That was an increase of 16% last year but again that was impacted by the currency impact which in the full year was about 8% of headwind, also the Connecticut tax law change, a portion of which was accounted for in the second quarter tax rate and the remainder was finalized in the fourth quarter. So if you aggregate those impacts in the year, that was about $0.12 of headwind and then the shift in mix between US and Canada cost us about $0.13 for the full year. ","On free cash flow, great story here in 2015. $919 million which compares to $557 million in 2014. Obviously the lower rental CapEx was a big part of the positive impact year-over-year but also the higher profitability contributed as well. ","Our cash taxes also had an impact. They were lower cash taxes paid and favorable working capital effects were also at play during the year for that $900 million or $919 million of free cash flow. ","Rental CapEx, as you\u2019ve seen already, gross rental CapEx reduced in the quarter by $109 million and that brought the full year total to $1.534 billion, somewhat below $1.6 billion that we've been guiding to, and that rental CapEx was about a $1 billion number for the full year. ","On the liquidity front. $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of the quarter. That included ABL capacity of just over $870 million, and cash on the balance sheet of about $180 million there. So we\u2019re well-positioned on liquidity as we typically are. ","Just a quick note on our share repurchase programs. We completed during the quarter the $750 million repurchase program that we were operating under previously. We bought out the remaining $10 million of that program in the quarter, and then we also began purchases under the new $1 billion authorization and, in fact, completed $111 million against that authorization during the quarter as well. So a total of $122 million of repurchases in the quarter and it put us on the path to executing the new $1 billion program over the course of the next 18 months. We started it in November of last year and so we expect to complete it by the end of April in 2017. ","As I pointed out in prior quarter we do need to be mindful as we execute the program of our limitations on share repurchases, in particular, the restricted payment limitations in our debt covenants. However when you aggregate those RFP baskets available to us plus the available cash that\u2019s held at the holding company, we have about $500 million worth of available capacity at the end of December in order to execute share repurchases. So we feel that we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to manage the program on a prudent timely basis as we go through the year. ","Return on invested capital in the year, just to touch that real briefly, was 8.8%, and that number was essentially flat compared to 2014. ","Let me finish just by addressing our outlook really briefly. You\u2019ve all seen the numbers that we put out. I\u2019d just point out that as Michael mentioned, we have a somewhat wider range around the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, EBITDA and indeed, we\u2019ve instituted a range for our view on rental rates. That wider range represents truly our view of the uncertainty that we\u2019re managing through right here now. And we put the wider range there to give us a little bit more flexibility in responding to whatever the environment hands to as we go throughout 2016. In particular, the range on rental rate, the minus 1% rental rate, top end of that range reflects our carryover \u2013 our carryover from 2015 is essentially 1%. And so as we go through 2016 in order to achieve the 1% decline, the top end of the range would require us to have some slight increases during the peak season on a monthly sequential basis, which we think is a reasonable -- reasonable outlook. To get to the 2% would require essentially flat monthly sequentials during the peak season.","The time realization improvements 70 basis points is also we believe very reasonable given the approach that we\u2019re taking to our management of the CapEx spend. $1.2 billion of gross capital, netting down to about $700 million after used proceeds, we think again is a great way for us to approach the environment that we\u2019re managing through right now. If we do that, that will net out to that $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow that you see in our guidance, very very comfortably. ","So those are the key things that I wanted to offer as prepared comments before I open the \u2013 ask the operator to open the call for Q&A. I\u2019ll just reiterate some of the comments that Michael made. Caution and flexibility are two of the key watchwords as we think about 2016 and we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to evaluate the environment very carefully and make decisions about what to do in response in a very prudent way. I think you can count on that and certainly look forward to talking all of you as we go forward throughout the year in managing the business.","So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase ","So I am going to ask question about free cash flow allocation. So I think you guys said that you have $500 million available from the buyback -- for the buyback into \u201916, but generating $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow. I am just curious about the potential for debt paydown, what you guys are looking at for \u201816?","Michael Kneeland","Sure, Nicole. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re thinking any free cash flow in excess of the share repurchase program that we\u2019ve talked about will go to debt paydown. So we\u2019ve still got the view that the share repurchase program we want to execute over the 18 month period, that averages out to something like $165 million a quarter or so. And that would eat up about $700 million of free cash flow if we did it on that pace. So the remainder of the free cash flow we would use to pay down debt, that is our baseline view of the best use of the cash flow given our outlook for the market and the opportunities that are in front of us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI Group.","David Raso ","My question relates to the free cash flow beyond 2016, just we all can have our own views of the length of the cycle. But just thinking about your maintenance CapEx levels, it appears the 2016 CapEx is getting down toward maintenance levels already and then we have cash taxes going up in \u201817 as well. So can you help us a little bit with that lever that we usually have to pull or things do go awry economically in \u201817 or \u201918, you usually have a pretty good lever on pulling the CapEx down. So given we\u2019re already down in maintenance levels, can you just walk us through where we could see CapEx get cut beyond \u201916 in case the need arises? I am just trying to understand the dynamics there.","William Plummer","So maybe I will start and Mike and Matt, you guys can chime in. The maintenance level for maintaining fleet size and age is probably in that 1.1 billion kind of area these days. And so that certainly is one view of maintenance and one view of where we could go to if things are softening up. But I would argue that there is no need to replace the units that we have, if our view became that we truly were headed for a downturn. And so I would argue that we could be even more aggressive than that and be a sub a billion in total CapEx if a downturn started to develop. So how far below a billion, I think we\u2019d have to -- we have to discuss that in more depth before we gave an answer to that. But could we carve another couple hundred, 300 million out of the $1.2 billion that we\u2019re spending this year? Yes, I think so. ","Michael Kneeland","Hey David, I would just say that $200 million of that growth capital is really going to or the growth capital we have is going to our specialty business. So if things were to turn south as you described we would obviously pair that back and as Bill mentioned, it's not unusual for us to ratchet back given the maintenance CapEx going forward if we had to. ","David Raso ","And I know it's relatively early in a quarter. But can you give us a bit of an update \u2013 if you said that earlier, I apologize, I missed it. But how the year started when it comes to sequential trends, I mean, usually January is not a strong great month, but just given the way the year ended, how are rates trending sequentially and year-over-year relative to the full year guidance?","William Plummer","So we won't characterize it with a number but I'd say that that rates are trending as we expected. By the way I\u2019d say the same thing for OEC on rent in the early part of the year here, even including the impact of the currency. OEC on rent is trending at what we expected and that's consistent with the rates ending up in the range of guidance that we\u2019ve given. So that\u2019s as far as we will go on that one right here now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace ","Bill, maybe as a follow-on to that last comment today. I was wondering if we could just decompose kind of rate dynamics, in the fourth quarter and broadly on \u201815 and then relate them to expectations on \u201916. Just wondering if we can talk about rate in Canada versus the US, talk about rates in kind of more heavily exposed energy markets versus non -- and then construction versus industrial, just so we can get a sense for what that interplay was last year and how we should think about those dynamics in the current year?","William Plummer","During -- guys help me out. I will start here. And so regards how rates finished out the \u201915, I think it's fair to characterize it as they finished weaker than we expected. We\u2019ve given the sequential months there at minus 10 basis points for October, minus 50 November and minus 50 in December as well. And remember, we\u2019ve told you that we expected seasonal to maybe slightly -- seasonal declines in that fourth quarter, right? I think it came a little weaker than what we thought. And Canada was certainly a part of that. As a result, the carryover that we brought into \u201816 starts at a lower point and we\u2019re watching very carefully how rates develop from here. And to our point earlier, that's going to be the watchword for the entire year. ","Canada, I don\u2019t know if you guys want to handle the Canada notion but Canada did have a fairly sharp decline in the fourth quarter \u2013 sharper than we expected when we talked to you at the third quarter call, and we\u2019re watching that very carefully and thinking very very aggressively about what do we do in response, right? What are the drivers? Is it something that we can address and if not, what can we do in response? So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about Canada and honestly thinking about the whole business as we come early end of the year. Matt, Michael, you guys want to add anything?","Matt Flannery","No, Ted, I think Bill captured it well. I would just say -- if the team up in Western Canada is really fighting it hard, specifically in Alberta and they\u2019re continuing to take the actions necessary to adjust their fleet appropriately and they cannot run the macro environment there and we\u2019re going to adjust appropriately and now we\u2019ll get some growth capital to the lower 48. ","Ted Grace ","Maybe ask a little differently, rates being down 180 basis points in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a dispersion like \u2013 on a relative basis that \u2013 what did Canada do versus, call it, Texas in the Gulf Coast, the stronger reasons like West and the South. I think what people are really trying to understand is if you look at down 10, down 50, down 50, as the monthly progression, how broad-based was that the sequential degradations?","Matt Flannery","Ted, I think you could say it was spotty and you could imagine the places where they had more challenges. So if you think of the relative rate we've enjoyed in the past, Western Canada and anywhere where we\u2019re doing shale drilling was the highest relative rate. So in markets where that was dramatically impacted mostly in Western Canada than any other single end market, you saw large rate decline. So we saw rate declines in Western Canada in Q4 of over 6%. So that would be the highest that you would see. But as you can imagine losing your highest rate business in Texas or in North Dakota or in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, right, up in the Marcellus Shale, those were the ones that has a bigger decline and then you had positives in markets on the coast where non-res was really carrying the ball for us and they were able to do well on some of the projects, Mike referenced in his opening remarks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Brandon Jaffe","Hey good afternoon. This is actually Brandon Jaffe on behalf of Jerry. Can you please provide some commentary on what you're seeing out of your industrial customers? Are you seeing any difference in activity from refiners, manufacturers or chemicals companies?","Matt Flannery","So Brandon, this is Matt. I think that we\u2019re still seeing growth and solid steady business from our chemical and also in our downstream oil and gas customers. But we\u2019re also seeing pressure from those that have a more significant holdings in any kind of exploratory or upstream oil. So I think that's predictable but when you look at -- what we count in our industry, you have to recall in our industrial and other we also put in our infrastructure. And we see some growth opportunities there. We see some growth opportunities in manufacturing and then above all of that, I know you specifically asked about industrial but we continue to see growth opportunities in non-res. So you'll see Global Insight say the industrial has got 5% growth opportunity and you'll see reports that we\u2019re in an industrial recession. I would say we\u2019re experiencing somewhere in the middle of that pack and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our business and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, I would only add that if you take a look at our investor deck, it has industrial outlook for the US and outlook for Canada, and it\u2019s really a story of two different worlds. But they\u2019re going to grow. And it\u2019s not so much capital projects, it\u2019s also maintenance and so that\u2019s why they go through spending and look how the industrial is forecasted for 2016. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.","Joe O'Dea ","I'm just trying to understand a little bit more in terms of how things unfolded over the quarter. I think as of a quarter ago, you were anticipating a quarter of a point to a third of a point of carryover headwind and now that\u2019s a full point, in terms of the experience you\u2019ve had with customers, I mean you talked about no surprise where the weak areas are. But was it really just a function of customers coming back and pushing for those price concessions, or was it more a matter of increased competition that whereas we had expected a lot of fleet would've been moved but still excess supply, and you still see that competition pushing rates down?","Matt Flannery","Joe, this is Matt. I would say that the concession part of the equation happened earlier in the year mostly in upstream and Western Canada, there are not really any concessions out of that side. But I think the growth opportunity from an OEC on rent perspective tempered any kind of rate improvement that we would get and we certainly had to partner up and defend some strong relationships here and there on national account base. But I wouldn't point to it as a concession driven situation. The fact of the one point carryover is really a function of what Bill stated what Q4 sequentials look like. When you have 0.5 negative in both November and December that made the full year carryover of a full point negative. So when you look at our range of 1 to 2 we\u2019d have to be flat for the full year of \u201816 to achieve that one and that\u2019s where we\u2019re driving towards, and if there is more there, we will take whatever opportunities we can get. And Mike said it earlier that rate discipline is a key lever for the industry as well as for us.","Michael Kneeland","I would only add two things. One, which is -- in the fourth quarter is where we saw a significant drop off in Canada that impacted our carryover as well. That\u2019s number one. Number two, to answer your question, at last year we talked about the supply and demand imbalance and with oil -- and then as the fleet additions coming in, it\u2019s not unusual to see some pricing pressure. And as we went through the fourth and first quarter, I\u2019ve always told a lot of investors that, this will be the challenge, this is the challenge that we have, simply because we don\u2019t have oil like we've had over the last five years. So it\u2019s more seasonal trend, more non-res trend and what gives me a lot of comfort is I am seeing the trend where the absorption is coming through in the fourth quarter, with Rouse and some of the data points they had. And the other one is the declines we\u2019re seeing in OEMs on their book of business tells me that we think this is a prudent decision-making. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC.","Seth Weber ","I just want to follow up on a couple earlier questions. I think the first one on the potential levers to pull. I think you guys \u2013 you\u2019ve got $40 million or $50 million through your efficiency program so far. I mean are there actual measures that you can take from a cost-cutting perspective other than cutting fleet, I mean branch closures -- any other, more on the expense initiative side that you guys have considered. I didn\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard any talk about that so far.","William Plummer","Sure, Seth. We certainly are looking at opportunities to help address any shortfall should it develop as we go through the year. We have taken some actions. You saw in the quarter that we took a restructuring charge in the quarter as we restructured some of our organizations in the last couple of months. We are looking for other opportunities that might make sense should the environment deteriorate from where we are. Those actions come across a wide variety of our operations. And so we\u2019ve got our usual lean initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years now, and those initiatives really resulted in a run rate of savings at the end of the year of about $53 million. We still are targeting getting that run rate up to $200 million by the end of this year. So there are lots of other actions that we\u2019re going to continue to look at. Right here and now we don't have a notion of branch closures. Right here now we don\u2019t have a notion of large headcount reductions but those are questions that we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate as we go forward. And we think that\u2019s the prudent way to get at it. In the meantime there are some specific things that we are already doing that we think we can double down on to help drive that run rate of cost saves higher and help realize some of those cost saves in the current year. ","So those are the things that we\u2019re focused on right here now. We continue to evaluate to see whatever actions we might need to add to the list that we already have. ","Michael Kneeland","The other thing I would add to that is \u2013 this is a very seasoned team and we have done this before, if need be, we\u2019ve got the experience -- not only through economic downturns but also in achieving synergies when your \u2013 during your mergers. So I have high respect for the team and what they are capable of doing. And as Bill mentioned, we\u2019re not thinking about it now but we are more than capable of making adjustments as they come. ","Seth Weber ","And then just circling back on the oil discussion, can you update us on what you think your direct oil exposure is today and whether you're still \u2013 whether you think you need to continue to move fleet around, I think you had a target of $200 million for 2015. Is there an estimate for 2016 or do you feel like that we\u2019re kind of near the bottom on the oil and gas, the weakness, you\u2019re starting to anniversary that soon?","Matt Flannery","Yes, Seth, this is Matt. So we had talked about at the end of the third quarter as far as fleet movement that we were down to about 30 million, 35 million of seasonal items and we pointed the heat and light towers and I would say other than the heat, be in a little bit light we still may have another 10 million, 12 million of excess heat right now in the oil and gas that we haven\u2019t repositioned because the demand hasn\u2019t been there. We\u2019re pretty much through the oil and gas movement. The exposure now in the upstream is down to 4%, down from 6% a year and a half ago when we started tracking this. So our exposure is certainly less and if we end up getting a little bit more of a dip than where the baseline is today, I don't -- certainly don't think it's anything that we\u2019d have to call out in large fleet movement, it would be like any other end market that ebbs and flows that we had to move fleet out.","Michael Kneeland","The other thing I would add to that is the fact that, look, we expect continued weakness in oil and gas, particularly in the upstream. And more importantly Canada -- my opening comments I think the issues there will likely persist with a very meek GDP growth that we\u2019re going to have for 2016. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher ","It sounds like you guys are still pretty committed to buying back stock these levels, which I understand simply because stock is down \u2013 do you still believe you\u2019d ever get opportunity ahead of you but if how are you weighing the possibility to reduce debt as the cycle moves. I guess, as a follow on, what would you have to see in order to start being more being aggressive and in paying down debt.","William Plummer","So we are as I said my prepared comments we are still on the pace that we talked about for the share repurchase and we think that that's appropriate given our baseline view that says that the cycle still has room to run. We believe there will be growth in construction in 2016. We believe that there is likely growth in construction in 2017 and on that basis, we think that the cash flow is going to remain robust and we can still execute that share repurchase to pay down some debt and end up in a better place. What would have to be true in order to change that point of you is I think we would have to come with different conclusion about how long the cycle has to run. I realized that there is a reasonable position that says, hey, Bill \u201816 and \u201817 are not looking good right now, so you should change your view right now. We haven't gotten to that point. ","The good news is that we\u2019ve got the capability, we\u2019re executing the program on a steady pace over time. Now we\u2019ve got capability to pull it back if we do change our view based on the experience that we have in the marketplace. If the first several months of the year come in weaker than we expect right now, then we\u2019re going to have to rethink that approach to the share repurchase and debt-paydown. And that's how we\u2019re approaching it right. This is part of the notion of flexibility, we set up a point of view. We established a plan based on that point of view but then we keep our head on a swivel as they say and keep asking ourselves: is it still right? Is it still right? And at the point where we can convince ourselves that it's not, then it\u2019s time to something different and that might include paying down more debt and buying back less share. ","Michael Kneeland","Yes, I would just add that, capital allocation for us is very important, it\u2019s also ore discussion that we have quite frequently. And those write, how we see the world, I guess the point I would make is we\u2019re approaching the world and this year cautiously, with our capital, with our CapEx and we will kind of see how things unfold and we will make adjustments and changes if need be. But right here and now we spend -- we frequently spend -- of these either monthly or at least once a quarter with the various of industry experts. Scott with the Global Insight, McGraw Hill and other industry experts to try to gauge the marketplace and try to understand what they see. And that forms our decision -- as part of our decision process. ","Steven Fisher ","So it sounds like, just to paraphrase that, you believe that debt reduction is really the downturn tool and capital discipline is really your up-cycle tool for not for letting the debt get too far, the levers can go out of control, is that the way to sort of paraphrase it?","William Plummer","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. Obviously the capital control and the cash flow it drives links to the amount of cash flow that's available for debt reduction or share repurchase. And we have to manage and balance all of that as we go forward. And I think it\u2019s a high-class problem to have to be able to say, oh, we\u2019re buying back shares and we\u2019re paying down some debt. But maybe the mix isn\u2019t right. It's great to be in a position where you can do both and that's the approach that we\u2019ve been taking, and we\u2019ve been talking to you about for a number of years. So that\u2019s a great position to be in. Now we\u2019ve just got to come to a view about what\u2019s the right mix. We have a view that says 700 \u2013 250, to use the midpoint of the cash flow -- is the view that we want to manage to right here now. So let's go forward and see if anything comes along to convince that, that's not the right view.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. ","Robert Wertheimer ","If I can do a two for \u2013 is there any flexibility to move fleet from Canada to the US, or you just under spend if that market sort of semi-structurally declines? And then second, just to ask a question, maybe there are bunch of us a little more bluntly. Have you been able to benchmark more on a branch by branch basis against major competitors to see if you have any competitive issues versus just mix issues that you\u2019ve been talking about for a long time on rate and utilization?","Matt Flannery","Thanks, Robert. This is Matt. So we are absolutely going to move fleet out of Canada. The first lever that we pull as we discussed before is to sell any excess fleet, that\u2019s outside of its real useful life and we\u2019re being very aggressive doing that as we speak right now here in the first quarter. The next lever would be to go through our normal retail channels and target, and maybe it\u2019d be some special values and to move some of that fleet. And then the third value -- lever would be to move it and there\u2019s some more complexity about moving it out of Canada than there would be if it was internal but not enough that we can't get over through most of our assets. I think the first two levers are going to be enough to adjust the fleet to where it needs to be but if we have to go further we are capable of doing it. And we absolutely are doing it today. ","Michael Kneeland","Your question around what kind of metrics and add down to the granular level of a branch on where we stand amongst our peers is something that we utilize routes for, it\u2019s not by branch, it\u2019s by market. It\u2019s a rearview mirror of 90 days but it is a useful tool that we use to help judge us in our process. We didn't have that years ago, it's relatively new, it represents about 40% of the market or somewhere around there, and we pushed that down, all the way down to the district level, which is kind of how they measure our markets. ","Robert Wertheimer ","And the outcome \u2013 I mean you feel confident, you talked about it, I understand that, at a high level. You feel confident that you are in a district level, let's say, or regional level that it's more mix than competitive slippage? Well, I know you're saying it better than [mass] overall. I get that. I guess I'm just thinking of larger competitors. ","Michael Kneeland","It only measures you against your peer group. It doesn\u2019t give you specific people. And so it\u2019s a very general tool of measurement and it\u2019s the best measurement we have because we all report electronically \u2013 the electronic feeds nightly to the Rouse report. So look, on balance, we are doing very well. Is there opportunities? Absolutely. And those are things that we pick up on, that helps the way in which we manage to become a better company. So that's why we subscribe to it and we use it \u2013 we\u2019re actually utilizing it as a tool. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger ","Hey, guys, good afternoon. I'm going to go little bit off here and a question on rent versus buy. On your three biggest general rent categories aerial, earthmoving and reach forks, where would you say we are in the rent versus buy percentage? And then also, if you would address it in your specialty category as well? ","Michael Kneeland","That\u2019s a loaded question but I would tell you that from an aerial perspective I would \u2013 Matt, correct me, it\u2019s probably in the high 90s goes through the rental channel. There is not a real distribution network to speak of. With regards to earthmoving, I think it's probably and there\u2019s reports out there, so I may get a little bit wrong but it\u2019s somewhere either 50:50 or 60:40 or one way or the other. But earthmoving is predominantly still owned, as in comparison to a lot of the rental assets. ","With regards to our specialty, think of specialty as not just the product, it\u2019s really the solution. We\u2019re trying to solve problems whether it be pump, how much fluid, what kind of distance, what type of fluid, what\u2019s the velocity do you need and how often does it need to be recurring, singles for power, there's various sizes, and then also with HVAC whether it\u2019s industrial cooling or whether it's something that you're doing for just air-conditioning. Each one is more of a solution than it is just the asset. ","Matt Flannery","Yes, I think Mike hit it very well. Trench, would add with trench -- the only one he didn\u2019t touch on would be we really got secular penetration against non-compliance which is a great end market sell-in to grow that pie. So I agree wholeheartedly. ","William Plummer","Scott, I interpret -- I heard your question as being what the guys answered. But I also heard your question as being \u2013 has the rent versus buy decision dynamic changed in any fundamental way? And my view would be no, it hasn\u2019t. There is still I think a pretty powerful argument for rental versus purchase across all of those cat classes that you mentioned. And we believe that that's going to continue to be the case going forward. ","Michael Kneeland","Yes, and on that point, the OEMs we\u2019re seeing their distribution network add more to their rental fleet. So rentals become more of a viable channel. ","Operator","Thank you. And due to time constraints, our next question is our final question from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Ross Gilardi ","Thanks, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Michael, I just want to ask you, I mean your number one competitor seems pretty insistent out there publicly that things are great in the rental space and that nothing is even remotely changed outside of the oil and gas space. They are clearly taking a much different stance on capital spending than United Rentals and I'm just wondering, is that one of the reasons why the pricing environment still hasn't really firmed up, or is the pressure on rate coming from elsewhere? And how willing are you to cede market share to them if they continue to keep their foot on the accelerator? ","Michael Kneeland","Well, look, everyone's got different strategies. So we have ours about value creation and that's what we\u2019re going to stick to. I have mentioned about the fleet imbalance, that\u2019s the data that comes out of Rouse in comparison to the growth of the industry. We can peek in different markets as well and we have more of an industrial non-construction related than others. We also have a more geographic footprint, like I mentioned in Canada which also has an impact. And so I think that each one has their own strategy but the industry has its own challenges and I can only speak to what we\u2019re going to do and how we\u2019re going to approach it. ","Ross Gilardi ","But in terms of the pricing pressure that is out there, do you think it's -- is it coming from Sunbelt or is it coming from the smaller players who are the ones that are really saddled with more of the over capacity right now? ","Matt Flannery","Ross, this is Matt. I won\u2019t speak individually to any one competitor but because we don't have visibility to what their baseline is and what their price levels are. But all I would say is when you look at the Rouse data which is industry average, so let\u2019s say just looking at 6% or 7% of the market, looking at a third to 40% of the market, it\u2019s very clear that there was too much fleet early on, time utilization was impacted and you can make the inference that that impacts rate growth in each individual market. ","As far as the smaller regional players, if you are in some of the markets where we\u2019re seeing great growth on the coast, I am sure we have small regional players that are seeing great growth as well. So it's really spotty as far as where you are on the map. And I think that's why you will hear different versions of what people are enjoying.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. I want to thank all of you for joining on today's call. We have three topics on the agenda this morning; first, our strong performance in the quarter; second, our external environment and how that's playing out in terms of demand; and third, we'll give you an update on National Pump and some of the other initiatives that we have underway to drive growth and efficiencies. Our goal is also to provide you as much visibility as possible into how we are thinking about the rest of the year will unfold. And then after that, we'll answer your questions. So let's get started.","The first quarter is always about pushing forward against seasonal headwinds and driving year-over-year improvement, and I'm happy to say that we overcame an unusually harsh winter and generated solid numbers in every major metric. We did this by managing the business very strategically to capitalize on pockets of demand, and we saw that in the results last night.","We had a sizable increase in rental revenue and our adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin were both first quarter records for us. We also increased our volume, time utilization and rates on larger fleet, and something that wasn't in the release, we improved our rate sequentially for every month in the quarter. Frankly, that was a little better than we expected. Now Bill will discuss the numbers in a minute but that gives you an idea of how we've turned a seasonal low point into a strong start of the year. And now, I want to turn our attention to the marketplace at large.","Last year, I said that we were bullish about the impending recovery. In January, we confirmed that equipment rental appears to be in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle. And now, commercial construction, which accounts for about half our business, appears to be in a broader recovery, and as you know, commercial construction is typically the last end market to pick up steam in an up-cycle. So any improvement is a positive sign.","Even so, the first weeks of the year were very difficult, but as we moved through late February into March, things evened out and we're now seeing near universal improvement in demand. And that's not just a 10,000 foot view. A few weeks ago, we completed our quarterly business reviews, so we have very recent input from the front lines. Reports from the field indicate more optimism than we've seen in years, and our customers are upbeat about their own business prospects. So in short, there is a widespread sense that things are back on track.","The first quarter metrics support this. For one thing, our used equipment margin was more than 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter last year, and that's another good indicator in market optimism. All but one of our regions showed rental revenue growth in the quarter and about half our regions had double-digit growth. I'll give you an idea of the scope of recovery. Our Midwest and Southeast regions turned in the strongest revenue performance. They had year-over-year increases in the range of 18% to 19%. And our Gulf, Mountain West and South regions were very close to the top. In the Southeast alone, we won bids on the City Center complex, a power plant, a pharmaceutical plant as well as two other sports facilities and a large residential tower.","We're also seeing infrastructure projects come back online both in the U.S. and Canada, and our industrial business continues to be robust, particularly with manufacturing and energy. And this kind of project diversity we expect recovery begins to take root, and we've been steadily scaling up to meet this demand, and now in the second quarter we're in an ideal position to take some significant steps forward.","First, there's our capital allocation. We plan to deploy over 40% of our gross rental CapEx in the second quarter and we'll purchase roughly $750 million of fleet against our full-year guidance of $1.7 billion. And as we noted in January, we increased our capital allocation for the specialty rentals this year with an eye towards growing these businesses. Our full-year CapEx plan for specialty fleet is approximately $240 million, and this includes capital for National Pump which we closed on April 1.","Now on the subject of National Pump, this is a new platform that has all the hallmarks of a home run. It's really put in the place as a key part of our equipment range, and the integration is doing well. We have rebranded the business as United Rentals Pump Solutions, in line with the way we market our other specialty offerings. The plan is to move the pump operation onto our technology by the end of June, and then launch a fully integrated cross-selling effort.","Our other specialty lines continue to turn in strong performances. Same-store growth for trench safety, power and HVAC was an impressive 19% year-over-year, and we're on track to open at least 18 branches this year including some for our new pump platform and our industrial tool business.","As we previously stated, we want to double the size of our high-margin specialty segment within five years. That gives you an idea of the importance we placed on these businesses as a lever of ROIC. Although they are unique in certain ways, our specialty operations share the same culture and sense of purpose as the rest of our organization. For example, every branch regardless of its focus understands that safety is our first priority, and in the first quarter, we worked together to drive our recordable rate below one, for the first time in our history. That's really a major victory.","Now I want to call attention to our lean initiative that we announced on our last call. Lean requires upfront investment of time and money, but we think it can generate a run rate of at least $100 million of efficiencies within three years. We have already introduced the lean process to over 100 of our branches, and while still early, we've identified what should be sustainable improvements in productivity, and we'll be able to share more about this program with you later in the year.","And finally, our entire sales force is out there talking to our customers about the benefits of sourcing their job site needs to a single provider. This gives continual cross-selling opportunities throughout the project lifecycle. It also encourages more revenue from our key accounts which were up almost 8% in the quarter versus last year, and it encourages our local unassigned accounts to stay with us and grow over time. Unassigned accounts, roughly a third of our revenue base, they were up almost 12% in the quarter. So we have a lot of momentum in a very promising year.","Now before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to share a personal observation. I believe that one of our greatest strengths as any organization is our ability to manage all the initiatives I just described, and still think about the business very strategically. We're a disciplined, thoughtful, inventive company that stays both focused and open-minded about our avenues of growth, and these qualities have given us a strong start to the year and we'll continue to make sound decisions that earn us investor confidence.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results, and after that, we'll take your questions. So, over to you, Bill.","William B. Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and I'll offer my good morning to everyone as well. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that were in the press release last night and hopefully it would be helpful. If not, ask questions in Q&A. Starting with revenue and in particular rental revenue, a nice quarter for us in rental revenue growth. It was up 9.7% over last year. It's about $89 million of higher rental revenue, and that rental revenue growth was really driven by all components.","Within that, our owned equipment rental revenues were up 9.1%, our re-rent was up 7.8%, and our ancillary and other items were up a robust 16% over last year. So, a very nice growth in all the components of rental revenue. Within the owned equipment revenue line, OER, Mike mentioned rental rate performance was good. We were up 4.3% on our rate metric for the quarter, very nice start to the year for us.","The volume was also very strong in the quarter. We had an average of just under $5 billion of fleet on rent. That's up 7.6% compared to last year. So, a nice volume quarter for us as well. And to get those two lining up nicely in spite of the harsh winter that Mike mentioned and also in spite of what was a headwind from the Canadian exchange rate which was down about almost 9% year-over-year, it was a nice start for us.","So, those were two nice drivers. Obviously inflation and mix were a headwind, call it 2.8% headwind, on the year-over-year growth for those two components combined. So, all in all, a very nice start to the year on a rental revenue basis and carries us nicely into the start of the second quarter.","Fleet overall was up this year. We spent roughly $330 million on fleet purchases for the quarter and so our average total fleet size was up 7%. So you combine that with the 7.6% growth in fleet on rent and that gets you the 40 basis point improvement in time utilization that we reported last night. So, again, another nice start on time utilization improvement for the year.","Before I leave revenue overall, just to hit used equipment sales quickly. We generated $110 million of used equipment proceeds during the quarter, and very importantly, we did it at a very robust margin of 49.4% adjusted gross margin. We think that reflects a very, very strong demand environment which despite the harsh winter started to build momentum later in the quarter. It was down from the prior year and that 11% decline we think was heavily impacted by winter weather.","We also think it was heavily impacted by the expiration of depreciation incentives in the tax code at the end of last year. We think some people accelerated their used purchases into the fourth quarter and borrowed it out of January and February of this year. But we are encouraged by the fact that March used sales activity was very nicely rebounded and so far April feels pretty good as well. So we feel we're well on track to deliver our used sales expectations for the full year.","Let me turn to profitability, starting at adjusted EBITDA, $519 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and delivered at a 44.1% margin, which is a record first quarter margin for the Company. So, a very nice improvement in adjusted EBITDA, $68 million year-over-year improved, and importantly, 310 basis points of improvement from last year.","Just to walk you through the bridge components of the year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, we calculate the rental rate impact at $33 million of that $68 million improvement, volume about 7.6% growth in fleet on rent translates into $41 million of the $68 million year-over-year improvement. Fleet inflation and mix was a headwind, a net of $16 million. The robust ancillary and other rental revenue growth that I referred to earlier translates into about $8 million of year-over-year improvement.","We had a good bad debt expense experience for the quarter. Year-over-year bad debt was favorable $4 million compared to last year, so that contributed nicely. We had our normal merit increase process. It cost us about $5 million of headwind in the quarter. And then the net of everything else we lump into other, including much of the FX impact, and all of that was a net $3 million improvement over last year. So, those are the components, and certainly if you have further questions about them, we could address them in Q&A.","Flow-through in the quarter was very robust for us, 87.2% for the quarter, and that reflects not only the underlying performance of the business but a couple of specific items that we'd call your attention to. You remember last year in the first quarter we had some one-off items that we called your attention to back then. It was $5 million to implement 5S across our branches. There was another $5 million that we spent to reduce the amount of fleet not available. So, those were one-offs, they did not recur this year, and so that $10 million year-over-year impact helped to boost our overall flow-through. We also had the bad debt experience that I talked about. It was $4 million of year-over-year improvement. So, that helped boost the flow-through effect as well.","And the last thing we'd point to is that we did have a decline year-over-year in used equipment sales. And so, we had a reduction in revenue dollars that took away roughly 49% margin dollars. So, that reduction in a lower margin item actually helped boost the remaining overall flow-through. So, we wouldn't extrapolate the 87% flow-through for the remainder of the year. We continue to believe that we'll deliver about 60% flow-through for the full-year as a total company, and I'll point out that that includes the impact of adding National Pump which adds revenue dollars at about a 50% margin. So that's going to weigh us down, but we still think that we'll deliver about 60% flow-through for the full year.","Dropping down to EPS real briefly, $0.90 of adjusted EPS for the quarter. That compares to $0.48 in the first quarter of last year. Obviously, a robust performance and it really just reflects everything that I talked about previously.","Before I go to the outlook, just real quickly on free cash flow and the capital structure. It was a busy quarter for us. Free cash flow came in very strong in the first quarter, $278 million, and that's of course after the $330 million or so we spent on rental CapEx and another $18 million or so on non-rental CapEx. So, a robust start to year on free cash flow and it puts us nicely on track for the free cash flow that we guided to for the full-year.","We had some capital structure actions during the quarter as well. We had previously announced the redemption of $200 million worth of our 10.25% notes. We made that announcement in the fourth quarter. We actually closed that redemption in the month of January and funded it from our ABL. So that transaction closed early in the quarter. And then later in the quarter we issued new notes, both to refinance another high coupon issue, the $500 million of 9.25% notes. We issued new notes there by reopening another existing issue, our 6.125% notes. And then we also issued $850 million of new notes to finance the acquisition of National Pump. And I call your attention to the fact that all of those issues happened during the month of March, the actual payments though didn't happen until the month of April. So, they actually don't show up as outflows on the balance sheet at March 31.","If you look at where we stand today, actually as of April 14, so earlier this week, on liquidity, the net of all those actions have happened and so our liquidity overall is a total of $1.35 billion. That includes available ABL capacity of $1.2 billion and net cash position of $132 million.","Just briefly to touch on the share repurchase program, we executed about $43 million of repurchases in our common stock during the first quarter. If you add that $43 million to what we did in the fourth quarter and what we've done in the month of April so far, we stand at about $90 million of shares that we repurchased against the $500 million authorization that we had. Obviously, we've said before that we expect to repurchase about $450 million of shares during calendar 2014, and we feel like we've gotten a decent start during the first quarter, but perhaps a little slower than otherwise it would be because so much of the first quarter was blacked out either for reporting purposes or because we were working on the National Pump deal.","So, you can expect us to ramp up that repurchase activity in the second quarter and we still are very committed to delivering $450 million of those repurchases in calendar 2014, and indeed getting the entire $500 million authorization done by April as we originally \u2013 April of next year as we originally announced.","Just to hit on our outlook real briefly, you saw that we didn't change any of the numbers to our outlook for 2014 last night but perhaps a slight change in tone. So just to reiterate, we expect total revenue in the range of $5.45 billion up to $5.46 billion during calendar 2014. Within that, rental revenue growth will be driven by our expectations around rental rates. We still see rental rates up about 4% for the year. Obviously, we did get off to a nice start. So, we hope that we will have an opportunity to do better and always will try to do better.","Our time utilization for the full year, we continue to expect to be up 30 basis points compared to last year, and I'd remind everyone that that would be another Company record. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect the full year to come in between $2.55 billion and $2.65 billion, and as I said before, we expect the flow-through to adjusted EBITDA to be about 60% for the full year. Our view of adjusted EBITDA is that we're not in a position where we think it's prudent to raise the range of expectation, but we have started to say that we expect to be near the top of that range, and so we'll continue to drive higher there if we have the opportunity.","The CapEx picture is unchanged as well, $1.7 billion of growth CapEx for the full year is our expectation, and that will net down to $1.2 billion on a net basis. And finally on free cash flow, we continue to expect between $425 million and $475 million of free cash flow for the year. And I'll remind you that all of those outlook components reflect the addition of the performance that we will realize from National Pump.","I'll stop there and open it up for Q&A, but certainly do feel good about what we did to start this year and we look forward to rolling out the rest of the year hopefully into a very strong year for us overall. So with that, operator, let's open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","I just wanted to go back to, in your prepared remarks you talked about this $100 million of cost initiatives. Can you talk about how much of that is embedded in your guidance for this year, it sounds like not a lot, and sort of how should we be thinking about that rolling through the model over the next couple of years and kind of helping the pull-through margin, is my first question?","William B. Plummer","Seth, it's Bill. We haven't given a number for 2014. What we said is that we'll make a nice down payment on that $100 million run rate impact. We certainly think that anybody who saw the number would agree that it would be a nice down payment, but that's as far as we've gone.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","And do you think it should have been linear or you think it's more backend weighted?","William B. Plummer","You know, we're just starting to roll out the program, so logically it has to be more backend weighted. But I think we expect that it will build nice momentum as we get into the second half. I'd remind you also that it is built into the guidance that we've given, right. The assumption that we have for how much, we did put in. So it's not something that we are keeping in our back pocket, it's out there in the guidance.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Right, but if it's accelerating going forward, could that in theory support a pull-through margin north of 60% next year, say in 2015?","William B. Plummer","I'm not ready to say that just yet, Seth. I think what we need to do is to make sure that we've got a handle on all the components that will impact pull-through next year. We certainly over the longer haul think that 60% is a good way to think about things. This could be a way to get higher flow-through, but it's maybe what we need to do in order to get to the 60% consistently. So, let us reserve comment on 2015's pull-through until we get a little closer.","Michael J. Kneeland","This is Mike. There is a level of transparency that we have with everybody in, and as I mentioned in my opening comments that as we go through the year, we'll be able to communicate more. There are several factors, it's not just the cost initiative, it's also our revenue initiative as well. So we want to be able to quantify and be able to speak clearly to everybody. So, expect to hear more as we go through the year.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then, Mike, if I could just follow up on National Pump, I know we're only a short time into the transaction but can you characterize any conversations you've had with customers about cross-selling between the two, any opportunities that have come up in the short time that you've owned the company?","Michael J. Kneeland","I will say that I did spend a day out at one of the branch right after we closed and I walked away very excited about the opportunities there ahead of us and also the management that we have brought on board, but I'll ask Matt to speak specifically to your question.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks, Mike. Hi, Seth. So, we obviously were very excited about the deal before we closed or we wouldn't have made that investment, but we've been even more pleasantly surprised by the reaction from our employees and our customer base. We've had strategy meeting over the last few days where Paul McDonnell and his team leading the specialty business and our national accounts team have been strategizing on cross-sell because the customers are pulling us in immediately. So, once we're all on the same platform, which will happen by the end of the second quarter, that will be even easier to do but we already are working on plans on cross-selling. Our customer base has really received very positively us filling this gap in our product offering.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you very much, guys.","William B. Plummer","Before we go to the next question, I just wanted to correct one thing I said on our outlook for the full year. The total revenue range will be $5.45 billion at the bottom, $5.65 billion at the top. I think I misstated that previously. I just wanted to get it straight. So, operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs","Can you gentlemen just talk about the action that you took to manage the fleet in the quarter? You alluded to it in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could flush that out because you outperformed the typical seasonality from a utilization standpoint, 1Q versus 4Q, in what should have been a really challenging quarter, and then if you apply typical seasonality from here, I guess you'd get well above your utilization target for the year. So I'm just wondering if you could just step us through what went right in the quarter.","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Jerry. It's Matt. Obviously, we really were focused on not putting any undue pressure on the areas that we're having a bad weather impact, and re-shifting fleet, both new fleet and existing fleet, to the markets where we had opportunities. With that being said, the Midwest had quite a harsh winter and was one of our highest growing region at 18% growth. So there is some of this that's just penetration and the continued growth of the build we've been doing since the integration of RSC. But I would say from a macro perspective broad-based, it was how we managed our opportunities and make sure we funded our opportunities, and the rate impact came as a result of us not putting undue stress on the impacted markets. So, we're very happy with the way the team managed that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs","And given that, Bill, at which point did you start thinking about taking up your CapEx outlook for the year in the context of how strong the start has been from a utilization standpoint or which utilization level on a full-year basis would you say we probably have enough fleet on hand?","William B. Plummer","There's not a magic number on utilization where we would say, it's time to spend some more. I think it's fair to say that we have an ongoing conversation about how much we spend daily, and the question is, what's the set of circumstances that get us comfortable enough to say, yes, we'll put more fleet into the business. I think it's also fair to say that we probably want to have a good look at how the season is building, and that means that you want to see April, you probably want to see May before you start having any serious conversation about possibly raising CapEx. So, stay tuned. I think we'll talk more about it in the second quarter earnings call and have a tighter view at that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS","As you've been exhibiting a greater level of discipline on CapEx, as you were just talking about, but I'm curious what kind of discipline, or if relevant lack of thereof, are you seeing in the marketplace from competitors both large and small?","Michael J. Kneeland","I'll talk about the high-level. First and foremost, I think when you look at all the companies that report publicly, they are all very prudent in the way in which they are approaching the markets. They have different strategies but they are putting in the appropriate capital for their strategy, but [indiscernible] you're seeing rental rates improvement. We also subscribe to [a route] (ph), we've mentioned this before, there's about 84, 85 good companies that report as you look in the rear-view mirror for legal reasons, about a 90 day lag on it, and it gives you a sense of different [MSAs] (ph).","When we look at how we're raising our rental rates over time, we're seeing kind of the whole industry come up. So that would tell you that everyone is appropriately trying to apply rental rates wherever they can. So that's the best market data I have. Matt?","Matthew Flannery","I think Mike covered it well, and I do think more importantly the OEMs are \u2013 I think that the combination of the OEM participation and the credit markets are making people to be more responsible than maybe they did going all the way in through 2008 and spending money and OEMs producing a lot of products. So, I think the growth is smooth, steady and appropriate for the level of demand that's out there.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS","That's helpful. And then maybe just a question about the agility of your business model. You made a decision to focus on rates as you talked about [to enable to] (ph) make adjustments for weather in the quarter. Just curious, at what point in the quarter did you make those adjustments and set that strategy, and I guess the broad question is, how quickly can your ship be turned to address market conditions, and then how would you say, how would you describe what your focus is for the second quarter?","Michael J. Kneeland","I would tell you that when you look at our fleet management process, there's an evolution of the best of both worlds when we went through the RSC transaction. We took some of their operating principles, we took some of our operating principles, we bonded them together and we developed a very disciplined approach in the way in which we are going to apply it, and this is the end result. So, I think that as Matt mentioned, we have the ability to fund pockets where they were needed. Conversely, we didn't put undue pressure in areas where it wasn't required, and I think that will be an ongoing process.","As far as our agility to move, it's very difficult to move things from say Canada down to say Florida, but you can sell and you can repurpose that capital. Those are the things that we do and all of these things are how we manage the fleet on a go forward basis. And by the way, it's not just a snapshot of where we are today, we have to think about it, where are we going to be six months to a year down the road because we don't want to be moving this capital on a continuous basis in that format.","Matthew Flannery","I think the additional good news is that we have broad-based demand now. We got through the winter by maybe being a little more selective about our opportunities, but as a Mike stated in his prepared remarks, we have growth in every region except for one geographically and half of them are double-digit growth. So I don't think we'll be as challenged with where we meet the demand from a rate perspective, it will be which ones we choose to fund at a higher level than others.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","What I would like to tackle is your sales force. You added I think 100 folks mostly unassigned accounts last year. Want to get an update on productivity there and then your plans for 2014 and which areas are you adding, the number and productivity and areas of focus.","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Scott, this is Matt. We actually have 153 more field sales reps on a year-over-year basis. So we had 100 for our goal for the second quarter last year but we built that up to 150 throughout the year, and that's where we sit today. We think that's appropriate level for OSRs other than additional reps we may bring in for our 18 cold starts, and you'll see some more there. So, we feel pretty good about the level of our sales team and we've got very good productivity out of them. As you see, our unassigned accounts grew faster than the overall Company growth in the back half of the year and for the first quarter this year, and that was really us reconnecting with some of the business we felt we lost during the RSC integration.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. And then I have a follow-up. I noticed from the presentation pack this time around, you're focusing on the specialty rental categories that you have. Historically you've also \u2013 you've been focusing on those that you were targeting and [I was just wondering] (ph) now you've achieved it. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking, is it going to be time spent on integrating or are you looking still actively perhaps at M&A and some of the other categories, liquid storage tank rental or others that you had listed previously?","Michael J. Kneeland","This is Mike. I would tell you that we are clearly focused on integrating the pump business and we've dedicated ourselves to growing our specialty business and we want to grow it, double the size of the business over the next five years. That is our main strategy. With regards to looking at other possibilities, I think it's prudent for us to always look at what the future may bring us and that is a big laundry list. So again, going back to the discipline that we've talked about numerous times, we look at a strategy, we look at the returns and then we also look at the culture, and all of those will always play into our decision-making, but right now we're focused on integrating the pump business and we see a significant upside opportunity for us to \u2013 like I said, it's got the hallmarks of a home run and that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank","With the goal of doubling the specialty business, how much of that is going to come from acquisition and how much of that would come from just organic growth and capital spending?","William B. Plummer","It's Bill, Phil. Most of it is going to be organic growth. That's the way we're targeting the initiatives for the business. So if there is an acquisition, we'll re-evaluate whether we should raise that target, change that target to add on the acquired growth on top of the organic growth.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank","Okay, as the last question, you answered the question on the liquid storage tank, obviously with National Pump you get into more of the oil and gas, is that an area of focus that you'll either spend CapEx or look to make an acquisition to kind of broaden out that pump portfolio?","William B. Plummer","So oil and gas is an area of focus just as an industry vertical for the business overall. I don't know that I'd say it's particularly a focus for acquisition as much as a focus for how do we build relationships with customers and how do we make sure that we can offer value to them. If an acquisition makes sense, right, then we certainly will look at it but it's got to hit our criteria and we're not going to do it just because we want to plan a bigger flag in the oil and gas sector. But Matt, Mike, if you want to add anything to that?","Matthew Flannery","No, I think Bill covered it well.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank","Great, and just the last one for me. I think, Bill, on the last call you mentioned 2.7 to 2.8 net leverage by the end of the year. Is that still part of the guidance?","William B. Plummer","Yes, I mean that's still in the neighborhood. It might be a touch higher. We put in the investor deck a slide that shows 2.9 at the end of this year. I think as we've gone through some of the refinance actions, as we've gone through finalizing the Pump acquisition and just looking at how the cash flow will play out over the year, it may be just a touch higher but it's still in that neighborhood.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray","Just wanted to get some color on your capital allocation strategy. You're generating attractive free cash flows of north of $450 million per year. Once you complete your delevering plan of 2.9 by the end of this year and your share purchase of $500 million by April of 2015, what's your priority for use of excess cash beyond that?","William B. Plummer","I'm sorry, George, can you ask that question again?","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray","So just want to understand what your priority for capital allocation is once you completed your delevering plans and share purchases to the targets that you have already issued?","William B. Plummer","Once we complete our delevering plan, that's interesting. I'd say we still believe in the leverage range that we talked about, 2.5x to 3.5x. If we get down to the 2.5x level and have completed the share repurchase program at that point and we don't have an acquisition that hits all of our criteria, then I think it's legitimate that we would talk about whether further share repurchase makes sense. That's certainly not something that we're afraid of. But we got to get through that priority of cash flow use that I just walked through.","And we've put a slide in our investor deck just trying to highlight the priority of thinking around cash flow allocation that very much reflects that order, right. First, you got to fund the organic growth of the business, but yes, that's before free cash flow. And then, once you have that free cash flow, we want to make sure that if there are acquisitions out there that make sense, that we will take a hard look at them, but if they are not lined up, share repurchase makes a lot of sense. That helps?","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray","Yes, very helpful, thank you.","William B. Plummer","Let me go back to Phil's question just real quickly. The 2.7, 2.8 leverage ratio was before Pump. So when you include the acquisition of National Pump, the 2.9 is our view currently of where we'll end the year, just to clarify that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group","Quick question on the guidance what's implied. It sounds like you're pretty focused on pushing rate and the rate started the year above the full-year guide. It appears April is off to where you run \u2013 you're running even higher above the guide on rate, and obviously your rate is pretty powerful on drop-through for incremental EBITDA margin. So just so I'm clear, the rest of the year, let's say the high end of the range for EBITDA and that means 2.625, just for argument sake, it implies the rest of the year incremental EBITDA margin base of only 50. If you want to pull out National Pump, 51. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand, is the focus still on pushing rates, because if it is, the 51 would be one of your lower incrementals in a while, so I'm just trying to understand is there something implied in that incremental margin that there is a little more of a utilization push versus rate, I'm just trying to understand what does it imply?","William B. Plummer","So we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the incrementals by quarter or by half. And so, it's not something that I'm as faceted with the numbers as maybe you are, David. I think as we do think about the full-year, we think that we want to make sure that the 60% or so flow-through that we've been talking about is a high probability, we believe that it is, and there are some things that in the second half may represent a little bit more of a challenge than we saw in the first quarter of the year.","So for example, we're going to ramp up our used sales activity. As we add more used sales in the back two quarters of the year, we're going to be adding revenue dollars at something like 50% EBITDA dollars. That will weigh out us a little bit more than it did in that first quarter. I don't see anything in particular that's a concern for the remaining part of the year, but I do think that we want to be a little cautious in terms of how we guide you to think about flow-through.","One other thing I'd point to as well is that bad debt expense, it was a very nice experience in the first quarter, $4 million benefit year-over-year. As we think about the full-year, we don't expect to see that kind of a benefit in every quarter this year. We're doing a lot of good work around bad debt to reduce the amount of aged receivables but as we sit here today we're not forecasting that benefit to continue at the level that it started out the year.","So, it's things like that that as we think through the remainder of the year in more detail, we say let's just make sure that we've got a handle on it before we get too aggressive in where we're going to end up for the full year.","David Raso - ISI Group","I appreciate that, Bill, but even if you pull out the $4 million benefit from bad debt, the incremental goes from 87 for the quarter to 82. I mean obviously it wasn't that big a number. So again, I'm just trying, bigger picture, trying to understand, are you implying something or is it, it is what it is and we can model as we choose, but I'm just trying to understand, is there a shift in what you're focusing on or would you argue, no, it's still a little more rate than it is utilization as your focus the rest of the year?","William B. Plummer","I think it's fair to say that we think about it more of it is what it is. We certainly are going to push rate. We think that we've got an opportunity. Whether we'd actually be able to execute and get better than the above 4% rate that we are talking about, we'll see how it plays out as the year goes on. Let me go back to the first quarter flow-through, that 87% was really aided by a few things, and if you take out the bad debt, if you take out the impact of those one-offs that we had last year, and if you restate used sales revenue to the same level as we had last year, so by taking out those special items that I mentioned earlier, that drops that flow-through down into the high 60s, low 70s kind of area. So, it's those kind of things that we look at and we say, okay, let's just make sure that we've got a good handle on things before we start changing and raising our guidance on EBITDA or flow-through or any of the other measures.","David Raso - ISI Group","I can appreciate that. Okay, thank you very much for the detail.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group","End markets, what are your customers telling you about their expectations for 2014, and I saw your slide showing your customer survey results were very positive, so any further color you can add there about what they are saying and also what type of [indiscernible] activity maybe picks up after you rebound through this tough weather [indiscernible]?","Michael J. Kneeland","This is Mike. Let me just give you a few data points, one of which would be the AGC which is the Associated General Contractors came out with an outlook survey recently and they compared it to 2013 and they broke it down into numerous categories for manufacturing, retail, private office, all the way down through to marine construction. And then after that was they had how were you rating it, expect your dollar, volume or project you complete in 2014 to be either higher, lower or the same. When you aggregate all those numbers, it's a pretty interesting chart that they mapped out where manufacturing, retail, private office, hospital, power, sewer and highway were all double-digit in comparison to 2013. So that would be one data point.","The other one would be Global Insight. Global Insight is another one that we work with, particularly with the American Rental Association, and they are seeing spending in commercial construction, office construction, lodging, retail, manufacturing and healthcare. Again, when you compare the two different ones, there are some similarities that kind of all fall altogether.","So again, it's not a perfect science, it's another data point that we look at in comparison with [indiscernible] reports and all the other reports that come out. But those are the things that we're seeing as far as our end markets and the optimism in what our customers are telling us.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Okay, that makes sense, that's helpful. And my second question is on used equipment margins. They were up a real strong 520 basis points year-over-year on an adjusted basis. How much of your used sales went to the retail channel this quarter relative to last year, just trying to kind of parse out [mentally] (ph) how much was from the [shift] (ph) \u2013 the more retail [indiscernible] strong performance in used [indiscernible]?","William B. Plummer","Nick, it's Bill. So operating from memory here, 55% or so was through our retail channel this year, and so that's still a fairly robust level of retail and that certainly helps support the margin. But we've also been focused on the market which is pretty robust. The pricing was pretty solid. And you combine those two things and it really does help drive the margin. So we'll continue to emphasize our retail channels, continue to try and take out as much of the auction sales as we can, continue to tap into the overall strong market pricing. There is a mix component to our margins on a year-over-year basis as well, right, the mix of units that you sell that can move things around. So that was probably part of what played into the significant increase in margin in this quarter as well, but channel mix and overall price environment were probably the bigger drivers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.","Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research","Congratulations on a strong quarter. Michael, I just want to go back to your opening remarks on the cycle and I guess as we kind of see the cycle play out, how are you thinking about the up-cycle? I mean you said multi-year, but are you thinking like three-year, five-year, maybe if you can just kind of give your thoughts on that?","Michael J. Kneeland","Look, I have learned that my point of view, I look at the next several years. That's probably after that it gets a little foggy. But all indications are, Manish, that when you look at the Global Insight, when you look at some of the other projections that are out there, 2014, '15 and they go into '16, show nice improvement on a year-over-year basis, with 2015 being one of the strongest. I think it really what is, it's convergence of all the projects coming together in 2015. But again '16 and '17, they still remain very positive but not as great as you would see in 2015.","All-in, they are looking at about 8% growth from Global Insight, 8.8% CAGR growth, which I think is very respectable, and those are kind of the things that we look at, but for me, I look at the next two years and I say to myself, what is it that's on our plate and what can we focus on, and do I look at the outlook outer years, absolutely, but as we get closer and closer then you get the metrics to come in and you try to validate whether those numbers are going to be plus or minus in any direction.","Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research","And then, maybe a question for Matt, I guess to support this growth, organic growth, Matt, are you finding that the kind of people that you want to have on your team out there? I mean what kind of issues are you having, if any, supporting this growth via hiring the right folks with the right skills?","Matthew Flannery","That's a great question. We're having great success. We have a very active recruiting team out on the field that works with the regions. Sales, management, that type of talent is readily available. We've become as we've grown into the largest in the industry quite a big draw in our space. I would say, if there was anything that I worried about long-term, it would just be, like every trade, it would be the technical expertise, but we do a real good job of home-growing that talent and we've invested a lot of money in the last two years in training because we do see that as a longer-term concern about making sure we have got the skilled labor to keep this equipment running. As far as management and sales, we are very, very well set. We're fortunate, Manish, to have low turnover for about the last five years and that's really played into our favor as well. So, I don't think people will be an issue but we are always focused on it.","Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research","Thanks. And then just lastly for Bill, obviously Bill, with performance having improved, with cycle showing good strength, I guess I'm trying to figure out why there is a two-notch differential in the ratings that Moody's has for senior unsecured versus S&P, and are there any discussions that you plan to have to kind of hopefully fix that?","William B. Plummer","We are trying to figure that one out ourselves. We have an ongoing dialog with both of the major rating agencies and both regular structured calls that we do on a quarterly basis and also ad hoc calls as things change around acquisitions or any other key items in the business. You'd have to ask Moody's how they are thinking about the rating directly. Our view is that we've delivered a capital structure and approach to managing the business that is pretty robust, but I'd point you to the Moody's folks and ask you to come back and tell me what they say.","Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for closing comments.","Michael J.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thanks operator and good morning everyone and welcome. And I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. In January, we laid out our plan for a year of profitable growth and a steady market recovery. We spoke about a balanced capital allocation program that supported both organic growth and acquisitions, the diversification of our services and our focus on return on capital. We set full year goalposts and anticipated well over $5 billion of revenue and more than $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA and significant cash flow generation. Last night, we confirmed that we expect to meet or exceed every one of our goalpost by year end. Halfway to the year, our plan has become a profitable reality for the second straight quarter.","We deployed over $1 billion of rental CapEx to-date and realized double-digit revenue growth on our fleet. We added an important new component to our specialty range with our acquisition of National Pump and we are well into our plan on cold start openings. And we are executing a market strategy that leverages our broader service offering as well as our scale. As a result we reported another quarter of significant higher volume on a much larger fleet with no erosion of time utilization. And more importantly better rates. Our adjusted EBITDA was the second quarter record for our company. And we revised our EBITDA guidance upward to a range of $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion for the full year.","Another one of our key metrics return on invested capital, showed real progress in the quarter, ROIC increased over 8% for the first time in our history and this has positive implications for our free cash flow. And last night you saw us raise our full year guidance for this range. These are results of the company that\u2019s firing on all cylinders in an environment of increasing demand. And once again our performance is outpacing the recovery just as we did last year. Based on our current visibility, we now expect to capture a full year rate increase of about 4.5%, which is up from our original outlook.","Bill will discuss our results in more detail prior to taking your questions. But first I want to comment on the macro environment. I will start with the forecast from Global Insight which we agree with the salient points, Global Insight as many of you know provides a comprehensive forecasting service to our industry. Currently the expectation is for equipment and tool rental revenues in North America to grow by 7.7% this year. That\u2019s slightly down from the earlier forecast, but it\u2019s still very robust. The U.S. industry growth is estimated at 8% and Canada is just under 6%. By contrast the U.S. non-residential construction spending is expected to grow at a rate of 3% to 4% in 2014. This reflects a slow start to a year has been picking up steam since March. So in short, demand for rental equipment is projected to exceed the upswing in non-residential construction by more than two to one. Contractors are changing the way they source equipment and as the largest provider we are in a position to capitalize more strongly on that change.","I want to make one related comment to industry growth. We are seeing very strong market for used equipment this year. Our adjusted second quarter margin on sales was up almost 49%. As we said before time utilization, rates and used equipment prices are the three main indicators of demand for equipment in our industry, so it\u2019s a very good sign to see all three of these metrics are strong. For our part we intend to remain very disciplined about our $1.7 billion of new fleet capital we are buying this year. We have high expectations for this capital and we are managing these purchases for maximum returns.","There is no question that our end markets are getting back on track. And in second quarter all but one of our regions saw rental revenue growth and the majority of our regions had double digit growth. Demand from the energy sector is strong across the board with power plants, oil and gas and renewables such as solar and infrastructure projects have been steady. We are also seeing an upswing in commercial and office construction. When the primary project is complete, such as corporate headquarters, we can often capitalize in after growth for surrounding hotels, schools and retail centers.","Our Specialty segment continues to turn in exceptional performance. As you know specialty rentals are an important focus for us going forward and these are high margin businesses with very attractive return on capital. They are cornerstone of our strategy to deliver superior value to shareholders. In the second quarter year-over-year our revenue from trench safety rentals was up more than 21%. And power and HVAC was up 54%. Our same store performance in these two businesses combined increased 22% over last year. So we are getting tremendous organic growth.","And revenue from our tool assets which are rented across our regions was up almost 10%. From a market facing standpoint, the primary value to customers lies in the quality of our service and our technical expertise rather than the equipment itself. This makes specialty rentals less sensitive to price pressure particularly when it comes to providing engineered solutions. In May we added to our power HVAC group with the acquisition of Blue Stream Services, four location business based in the Gulf. Blue Stream serves a good diversity of end markets, oil and gas, disaster recovery, construction, industrial, and entertainment and it will be integrated into our network later this month.","And of course the most significant change to our specialty segment was our acquisition of National Pump on April 1. The pump operations moved on to our IT platform in June and we are now serving customers as United Rentals Pump Solutions. Pump customers have access to our complete range of fleet and we are expanding our cross-selling of pumps to a broader customer base. We are pleased with the caliber of the pump acquisition. It brought a great team on board and it\u2019s off to a strong start. In fact, it\u2019s outperforming our plan. In the second quarter, rental revenue was up almost 62% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of more than 50%. This acquisition also gives us an ideal platform for expansion to cold starts and at least three of our specialty openings planned for this year will be in pump.","I also want to update you on our few internal initiatives we have in progress. First is our lean program, which I discussed last quarter and this is based on the Kaizen philosophy of improving even the best operations. So far, we have completed Phase 1, which involved 306 Kaizen events at 141 of our branches. And though it\u2019s still early, we see measurable improvements in productivity in areas, such as driver turn time and shop flow. And we feel that our targeted run rate of at least $100 million in efficiencies in three years is very achievable. Second, we are operating our business more safely than ever with a recordable rate of just below 1 through June and a 32% reduction in injuries year-over-year. And I am proud to say that we reduced our injury count more in the last six months than in the full 12 months of 2013.","In last month, we also launched our United Academy, which is an online customer portal for safety training and certification management. Two weeks ago, we added our first blended learning programs, which provide a combination of online training with practical experience at our branches. United Academy is going to be a powerful force for safety in our industry.","In closing, I want to say that clearly we are seeing the immediate benefit from the execution of our plan. At the same time, our strategy is built for the long-term to service well beyond 2014. We are looking at an up cycle with multiple years of industry growth. And when we apply our model to that forecast, we are excited about the kind of returns we can generate. And that\u2019s just a broader goal of value creation, but also the components of that value such as substantial free cash flow and a higher return on capital. And by all accounts, we are in a very good place with a long and profitable runway ahead.","So, with that, I will turn the call over to Bill for the financial results and then we will take your questions. Over to you, Bill?","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. I will center my comments around bridging our rental revenue performance for the quarter, our EBITDA performance for the quarter and then updating the outlook and along the way we will throw in hopefully some useful information about couple of other items.","So, starting with our look at revenue performance, rental revenue in the quarter was up 16.8%, so very robust performance. Obviously, that was aided by the addition of the acquisitions in the quarter, but still when you exclude the acquisitions, pretty robust rental revenue result for us in the quarter. So, 16.8% rental revenue growth, that\u2019s $170 million of year-over-year rental revenue growth. Within rent revenue, re-rent and ancillary items accounted for 0.7% of that 16.8% growth. Ancillary in particular had a robust quarter for us. Ancillary revenue was up $24 million year-over-year within that 0.7%. Re-rent was up about $5 million, so $29 million improvement year-over-year from those two items.","When you look at the owned equipment revenue growth that 16.1% that remains, it was driven by rental rate performance and that was up 4.9% in the quarter that was worth about $43 million of the year-over-year increase. Volume growth was very robust at 10.3% volume growth. This year, that\u2019s worth about $90 million of the year-over-year revenue and again that includes the acquisition of the acquired entities this quarter, but even if you strip out the National Pump acquisition, that volume growth was still pretty impressive at 7.6% ex-pump. So a nice volume quarter for us.","We have been breaking out fleet inflation and the impact of that year-over-year on revenue and that this year was about 1.7 percentage points negative headwind, which resulted in about $15 million deduct from year-over-year rental revenue and probably the best way to think about that fleet inflation as we have talked before is as a net against the volume growth. FX was another headwind for us in the quarter. The Canadian dollar year-over-year was down to the extent of about 0.9% impact on our year-over-year revenue growth. So a negative 0.9% from FX or about $8 million of year-over-year deduct from the Canadian dollar move.","The remainder, mix and other was a robust 3.5% positive in the quarter. And that positive really reflects the impact of National Pump. National Pump\u2019s volume growth is included in the 10.3% volume that I referred to earlier. And given that they have a higher dollar utilization of the fleet that they add, they substantially improve the mix result for the quarter. So, 3.5% mix and other impact in the quarter positive that\u2019s equivalent to about $31 million of year-over-year benefit from mix. So, add all those up, you get the $170 million of year-over-year rental revenue improvement, and again, it reflects what was a very good rental revenue performance for us in the quarter.","Before I leave revenue entirely, just a quick touch on used equipment sales for the quarter, another good quarter for us on used sales, proceeds of $138 million and a margin which was very robust, 48.6% is the adjusted gross margin from our used equipment sales, that\u2019s 660 basis points better than last year. And obviously, it reflects what is a continued strong demand for used equipment in the marketplace as well as our continued focus on selling through our retail channel, which is the most attractive margin channel for our sales. So, a very nice result in used equipment for the quarter and it certainly does support the macro environment comments that Mike made about the continued strength.","If we turn to profitability next, first looking at adjusted EBITDA, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA was up $114 million to $663 million in the quarter. That\u2019s a margin of 47.4%, which is a new record for the second quarter in our company. And looking at the breakdown of that improvement in EBITDA dollars, $114 million total year-over-year improvement. We attribute $41 million of that $114 million to rental rate, the 4.9% rental rate increase that we saw in the quarter. Volume contributed another $61 million of year-over-year growth. Netting against that would be the fleet inflation impact at EBITDA of negative $11 million.","And then as you look at the other items in the year-over-year growth, the mix impact that I called out in revenue resulted in about $16 million of EBITDA improvement and again a very nice contribution from the addition of National Pump. The ancillary growth, that I referred to earlier, resulted in about $12 million of EBITDA benefit in the quarter and used sales also contributed nicely, about $11 million of year-over-year EBITDA growth. Working against that was our cash incentive compensation accrual in the quarter, which was up year-over-year about $12 million, so a $12 million headwind as our incentive programs reflect our increased expectations for performance over the entire year. So, it\u2019s a classic good news bad news story. Performance is better, that\u2019s great, but the incentive comp represents little bit of a headwind against that. Still the overall impact is very positive. And the remaining $4 million headwind is merit increases and some other small other nits and nats. So, all of that adds up to the $114 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement, driving that margin which was a 190 basis point improvement in margin up to as I mentioned the 47.4% EBITDA margin in the quarter.","Flow-through in the quarter came in at 59.1%. And in fact, it\u2019s a flow-through result in the quarter that makes us comfortable to continue to look for about 60% flow-through impact for the full year. Obviously, the flow-through reflects all of the factors that I touched on in revenue and in our EBITDA performance. It is worth noting through thought that flow-through impact in the quarter was weighed down by the addition of National Pump. As we have said before pump revenues come at about 50% EBITDA margin, so as we added in the quarter National Pump revenues we added EBITDA at about $0.50 on the $1 for those revenues. That weighs down the overall flow-through of the company and resulted in that 59.1% flow-through for the quarter.","If you were to exclude pump the flow-through in the quarter for the full company would be more like 63%. National Pump had about four percentage point impact, negative impact on our flow-through in the quarter. We expect something comparable for the full year effect of adding National Pump this year somewhere in the 4% to 5% range for the full year impact of adding National Pump to adjusted EBITDA.","Real quickly I will just touch on EPS for the quarter, very strong result for us at $1.65 in the quarter that\u2019s up from $1.12 in the second quarter of last year and obviously reflects all the operating points that we talked about earlier. On liquidity, capital structure, free cash flow we had a very strong free cash flow result in the quarter in the first half. First half free cash flow was $240 million and that of course reflects all the free cash flow remaining even after our CapEx spend this year. Rental CapEx was for the year-to-date period the first half was just over $1 billion of our total $1.7 billion expected spend for the year. So a pretty robust free cash flow result of $240 million for the half and puts us well on track to achieving our outlook for the full year, that free cash flow helped to maintain our ABL balances and maintain our liquidity overall. We finished the quarter with total liquidity of $1.2 billion and that includes ABL capacity of about $1 billion available to us. Along with that we also had about $170 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.","Our share repurchase program continue to pace in the second quarter. We bought $185 million worth of our common stock in the second quarter. That brings the cumulative program purchases to $237 million through the end of the quarter. Nice progress puts us well in our way to executing the $500 million total program that we are operating against and well on our way to executing what we have said is going to be $450 million in calendar 2014 of repurchases. So our plan still is very much to complete the program overall by April of next year.","Before we move to the outlook just a real quick comment on ROIC, ROIC finished the quarter at 8.1% on a trailing 12 month basis through June 30 and that\u2019s an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the past year, so very nice year-over-year improvement in the trailing 12 month view of ROIC. And we continue to expect to drive ROIC higher as we go forward. It was benefited slightly by the impact of National Pump in the quarter. Excluding pump ROIC would have been right at 8% for the quarter, so it bears out the premise for investing in National Pump as we go forward.","Our outlook you all saw we updated last night. We revised the revenue rate and free cash flow and EBITDA guidance I will leave you all to read it in detail, but we did narrow the range of total revenue that we expect in the quarter, it\u2019s now $100 million range centered around $5.6 billion. Rental revenue is within that, obviously it will be impacted by our rate expectations. We have raised our rate expectation for the year to about 4.5% from what was previously about 4% for the year, so reflecting the nice momentum that we have seen rates in the first half.","Time utilization we continue to expect to finish the year at about 58.5%. Free cash flow, we have raised that range a little bit. We are now expecting between $450 million and $500 million of free cash flow for the full year. And our view of adjusted EBITDA is now higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $2.650 billion and $2.700 billion for the full year. So, those are the key points that I wanted to make. If I missed anything that you all want to talk about, please raise them in Q&A.","So, at this point, operator we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning everybody.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning, Seth ","William Plummer","Good morning","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Wanted to focus a little bit on the specialty business if we could, in the press release where you are talking about the National Pump deal, you cite that purchase price of $853 versus the $780 at the time of the announcement. So, I assume that reflects confidence or line of sight to the earn-outs. Can you talk about, I mean, you said you are running ahead of plan, so should we assume that you are going to hit that first earn-out in 12 months?","William Plummer","Seth, it\u2019s in the Q if you look at it, the $853 is comprised of $777 I think it is of cash consideration. It excludes the stock component of the purchase. And then the remainder is the contingent consideration, it\u2019s the earn-out. It\u2019s the way that we have to account for the earn-out. So, that $76 million is an expected weighted average of the earn-out that we expect to pay discounted back to present value. Did that help?","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thank you. Okay. And is it possible to parse out how much of the upside on the rate increase goes to the 4.9 in the quarter? How much did the pump acquisition contribute to the strength in rate in the quarter? Is it possible to split that out? You kind of qualified it for their ROIC, I am wondering, if you could do that for rate?","William Plummer","There is no impact of rate from pump. Remember, the ARA standard calculation you used the prior year weighting for the various classes and we didn\u2019t have pump last year, so its weighting was zero in the rate calculation.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just sticking on the specialty business, last quarter you talked about specialty getting about $240 million of the growth CapEx, I think it was a $560 million number, has that \u2013 has your thoughts around how much capital you are committing to the specialty business changed at all, you obviously didn\u2019t change your full CapEx number this year, but I am just wondering if you are committing more capital to the specialty business than you previously thought?","Matt Flannery","Yes, this is Matt. We are absolutely continuing to fund that business. And we were even exclusive of the pump acquisition, but we will continue to fund that business and we feel we can do that without having to raise our overall capital anymore than the guidance that we changed earlier in the year when we announced the acquisition.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","But is it still in that $240 millionish range or is it going to \u2013 I am trying to understand what percentage of the pie it\u2019s getting?","Matt Flannery","So, it\u2019s still in that range this year, because we don\u2019t have to fund as many cold starts in the power business that we did last year. If you recall we started a lot of power cold starts last year and not as many this year. So, it will still be in that range, but we expect as we go forward, we will \u2013 that range could increase. We are hoping it will increase actually.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And with the increased free cash flow guidance for this year, does that I must truly assume that your M&A could pickup or how do you envision spending that extra capital?","Michael Kneeland","Well, this is Mike, Seth. I think that we are always going to be on the horizon looking as I stated in my opening comments, specialty is the cornerstone for our strategy right now. We will look and we just did the Blue-Stream, but just as I said this more than once that the bar is pretty high to get over the hurdle for us to think about it. We pass on more than we go deep in. That being said, I think our cash flow will be used right here now as to kind of pay down our debt at this point.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you very much guys.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, thank you.","William Plummer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from David Raso from ISI Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Raso - ISI Group","Good morning. The free cash flow target we used to speak of the $1.5 billion from 2013 and 2015, is that still a number we should think about as a target for the three years?","William Plummer","Yes. Hey, David. Yes, we continue to think about that same number. Obviously, we are enhancing our chances of getting there as we raise our outlook for free cash flow this year and we will continue to work hard to hit that number and do even better if we can.","David Raso - ISI Group","It implies then free cash flow for \u201815 as north of $650 million and even if you do payout the earn-out to the full $125 million, you have finished the last $50 million for repo. It\u2019s going to leave your net debt at the end of \u201815 probably at or below the low end of your leverage ratio to 2.5 to 3.5 that you target. So, I was just curious if you can maybe give us some insight on where are you targeting ending \u201815 leverage? Is that math right there really tells you unless EBITDA is wildly off from when you think it would be, you are going to be below the low end of your leverage?","William Plummer","So, all we have said so far, David is that we will be toward the low end of that range without giving out any new guidance for 2015 I think I will stick to that. But I would just add we feel very comfortable about all of the comments that we have made about \u201815, including the contribution \u201815 makes to the $1.5 billion three-year cash flow, including the leverage being in the area of that the low end of that range. And so I won\u2019t go any further there right now. As the year plays out and as we get ourselves prepped for our Investor Day, maybe we can say more as we get later in the year.","David Raso - ISI Group","Well, I guess that\u2019s the related question then. Is there anything we should start thinking about the message for the December 4 meeting? There is a couple of milestones people are trying to think about, obviously at this level is there a stock split thought process, is the entry into the S&P 500 isn\u2019t really up to you, but you would think that\u2019s something that could be out there that\u2019s obviously potentially could happen, obviously some of the leverage numbers I was talking about for next year. I mean, there are some things we should be thinking about already as a framework for the message on December 4?","William Plummer","Okay. Five months in advance, he wants the message already. I would say stay tuned. We\u2019ll develop those thoughts as we go. Mike, I am sorry.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. So, David, we are still concentrating on this year and we will frame up our discussion points for the September meeting. You raised one there is other investors who are asking other questions as well. So, we will try to make sure that we can \u2013 we will try to answer as many as we possibly can as long as we get closer. As you know in December, we will have our understanding of what the 2015 will look from the roll up of our budget, so it will be an appropriate time in early December to have that discussion.","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thank you.","William Plummer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks Good morning guys. Hey, one question but a couple of parts in it, I will ask it all upfront. Can you address how rental rate growth will flow over second half just a bridge the 4.5% rate guidance for the year and then the follow-ons to that are how you are thinking about rental rates long-term just with a strong year again this year with specialty. National Pump mix team and more specialty to come, what\u2019s the long-term view on that? And then lastly just kind of still on the rate theme, what the competitive environment feels like out there. It sounds like you guys are being good leaders, but just any anecdote there. Thanks. I will cut it there. Thank you very much.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, Scott. So, I will start with the near-term and what gave us the confidence to set a target 4.5 for ourselves for the balance of the year. If you think about that sequentially and what we would have to do, we will have to do 0.5 sequentially for the base \u2013 for the balance of our peak season, so July through October, 0.5 and then flatten out to down in November and December, that delivers a 4.5 result for the year. So, it\u2019s not a slam dunk so to speak, but we feel confident that\u2019s why we raised that guidance. As far as long-term, we hadn\u2019t put a long-term target out there yet. I will let Bill speak to it some.","William Plummer","Sure. But just add on to the short-term statement, so if we did that 0.5 through October Scott that would put our year-over-year third quarter rental rate performance in the high-4s and not quite 5% but in the high-4s. And that would put the fourth quarter year-over-year in the lower half of the 4s. So hopefully that gives you a little bit better sense as the second half gains year-over-year rate. For the longer term I think we have talked for a little while now that we continue to see rates over the long-term trending down from the year-over-year growth rates that they have been achieving recently, down to something that looks like 3% a year sort of a steady state. That\u2019s the way we think about our long-term forecasting. I am not saying that we will get that 3% next year, if we finish this year at 4.5 say that will be pretty good momentum carrying into next year and maybe do a little bit better than 3% next year everything else holding \u2013 the macro holding in the kind of growth rate that we are experiencing right now. But as we think about \u201916, \u201917, \u201918 something like 3% we think makes a lot of sense as a modeling assumption. And obviously the macro can swamp that for the better or for the worst, but that\u2019s how we think about the long-term.","Michael Kneeland","I would only add Scott that as far as the competition, I think everyone is being good stewards and marching forward. When you take a look at the Rouse report we have a bandwidth in which are leading the charge. What that band seems to be consistent by all of the report month to months which tells you that as we are growing our rate, the industry is growing our rate as well. And then I think everyone else who is public has been reporting positive number. So I think from our perspective that\u2019s how the industry has been reacting. I will also say that it\u2019s necessary because inflation kicks in prices go up and we have to earn over our cost of capital as an industry. So I think it will continue that trend. And to Bill\u2019s point the macro environment will be one of the ones that we will be able to monitor and judge the rate improvement. But I am also pointing out one last point that is we are always as a company strive to maximize our return and also on our rates.","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great. Thanks guys.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Hi, good morning. I am wondering Bill you talked a little bit about return on invested capital, I am wondering if you are still targeting double digits by the end of 2015 and how you see the trajectory of getting to that metric, is it sort of a steady 100 basis points a quarter or now you tend to be more of a hockey stick at that end and why and I guess related to that this National Pump is the interesting in that, you are taking a local high margin product service and leveraging it across your network is part of a key element to the plan on getting to that return on invested capital you need to do more of the these things that\u2019s sort of a new business model for acquisition for you?","William Plummer","So, on the ROIC, just to be clear I think what we said about ROIC is that certainly we are targeting double digit 10% is our internal hurdle rate. And we have talked about achieving that in the material that we put in our investor deck achieving that over a 3 to 5 year period. So 2015 is a little more sudden than what we would say, we would expect to achieve double digit ROIC. Not impossible but that\u2019s not what we have talked about historically. I do believe that growing in the specialty areas is going to be an important component of us achieving that high level of ROIC. Again in the material we put in our investor deck there is a contribution that we have there from business mix and other and part of that business mix is from growth in the specialty areas either organic growth or indeed if we do any further acquisitions. The material we put out does not assume acquisitions, that\u2019s purely organic growth but acquisitions certainly could help accelerate that process if we found the right ones. So, I think that\u2019s the way we talk about specialty and its contribution. Specialty certainly will be an important driver, but it\u2019s not the only driver of us getting to the levels of return that we want to get to. There are things that we can continue to do in our base business and we are working very hard at those everyday.","Steven Fisher - UBS","And just to follow-up, what was the starting point for that three to five years, is that back from our Investor Day in 2012 or is that sort of just been ongoing?","William Plummer","Yes. So, that\u2019s something that we have put out in our investor material, I don\u2019t know, quarter, two quarters ago. It\u2019s based on 2013 ROIC. So, 2013 and we have targeted a three to five-year horizon of getting above 10% and we have talked about the components that we think will drive us there.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. Michael, can you talk about out of the lean initiative that you mentioned what would the impact be on fleet available for rent, though it looks like in your long-term bridge you are looking for 100 basis points of utilization improvement per year? Is that the driver, I know you spoke about the cost benefit, but maybe you can touch on the utilization opportunity of the results?","Michael Kneeland","Well, I think what you are referring to is as we go to the lean process we are talking about the shop flow and turnaround time, which will be a component of not available for rent. And we \u2013 if we were to take down 2 points, that would be a substantial amount of freed up cash to deploy to put on rent. That\u2019s part of the strategy around the lean. As I mentioned, we have had 141 branches. We are seeing nice improvements in efficiencies there. And we are going to continue to focus on that. So, that\u2019s part \u2013 that would be part of our plan. I think the other part of our plan around the not available for rent is really just about discipline and fleet management. And when we took a look at the best of both worlds between United Rentals and RSC, we merged the two together. We have a gentleman who came over from RSC who is managing our fleet with the field and is doing a very good job of implying and putting that process to work. So, our processes have changed as well in the way in which we deploy capital and move our fleet, but those will be the two dynamics that we are focusing on. And if you take a look at our size of our fleet, 2 points is real money.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you. And can you just talk about on the capital allocation side, which regions you are seeing outsized capital allocation, still where you are seeing the most of maybe still in the top two or three regions within your company?","Michael Kneeland","Yes. Matt?","Matt Flannery","Yes, sure, Jerry. So, regionally, you could imagine where the hotspots are. And although we have had broad-based growth as a matter of fact we had 12 of our 15 regions show double-digit growth and that\u2019s exclusive of pump will also obviously have robust growth. So, we are spreading the capital, but there are couple of hot pockets, where you could imagine the energy sector and not just upstream gets a lot of talk, but we are seeing capital projects at a high level in the energy sector overall, whether it\u2019s power plants or LNG plants. So, those hot pockets along the Gulf Coast and then some spots up in the Northern Midwest are certainly getting their fair share of capital, but I wouldn\u2019t point to just one or two spots where we are seeing robust growth in many of our end markets.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. I would only add that the only other thing that we are doing differently on a capital allocation is around contribution margin, not only by asset, but by customer. And that is probably one of the key takeaways of the changes in the way in which we are putting our fleet to work. So, under the gentlemen I mentioned earlier, that is being implemented through the field. They understand it. And it\u2019s a different way in which we look at the world. And therefore the monies that we talk about that the capital allocation that\u2019s one of the reasons why we will continue to make sure that the specialty businesses are well-financed and well funded for their growth. And doing it both organically as well as through cold starts and we have done two acquisitions. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Good morning.","Michael Kneeland","How are you?","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Thank you for taking my question. I just want to drill a little bit deeper on rates, you mentioned that your pump business was not reflected in rate growth this quarter since it was not in the business a year ago, once National Pump does lap next year can you quantify the impact you will have on the rate growth?","William Plummer","George I don\u2019t think it will be a significant impact one way or another the rate growth is not dramatically different than what we are seeing in other areas. The pump story is more about getting more fleet on that, it\u2019s a volume story for us more like here now. And that\u2019s the real opportunity if I can get out there find the customers who need pumps and get those pumps in their hand. And so that\u2019s what we are chasing at. I don\u2019t think you are going to see it moving our rate performance dramatically once it does start being included.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Very helpful. Thanks very much.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick Coppola from Thompson Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research","Good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research","So I wanted to ask the one question on weather here and kind of in your conversations with customers how much volume in Q2 do you think could have potentially been from work pushed out from winter weather and really just some catch up activity occurring?","Matt Flannery","Hi Nick, this is Matt. We are not really seeing that as something that we are hearing from our customers, it\u2019s really when you think about the cycle of a project you can ramp it up some and maybe condense the front end of it if you have a delivery date towards the end of the year and maybe you can condense some but you still got to go through the normal phases of construction. And I don\u2019t know that you condense it enough, but it would have a real impact on Q2 revenue maybe some small projects that had a very short window of needs, but that\u2019s not a monstrous spot of our portfolio. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material and which we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material impact.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research","That makes sense. And then just my second question can you give us any color on what\u2019s been going on through the first few weeks of July here and our utilization rate kind of trending in line with your expectations and any kind of incremental color on that would be helpful?","William Plummer","Sure, Nick, it\u2019s Bill. Yes, the first quarter \u2013 excuse me the first parts of the third quarter early part of July things are trending nicely for us. So and very much in line with the outlook that we have given and what we expect. On the rate front, on the utilization front, volume front it\u2019s trending well. And then Matt or Michael if you guys want to add anything.","Michael Kneeland","No, I think you said it.","Nick Coppola - Thompson Research","Alright. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.","Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research","Good morning. First question I think is on the EBITDA incrementals into back half of the year, you had sort of expressed that there would be a little bit of a step down into 2Q and understand the National Pump impact, but as you go into the back half and sort of implying an additional step down, could you just walk through some of the components driving that?","William Plummer","So, in the back half I think the key things to remember are the impact that we will see on the year-over-year rental rates. I think I mentioned that before with the fourth quarter in particular being a little bit less of a year-over-year improvement than what we have seen in the first few quarters of the year in the lower half of 4s instead of in the upper half of 4s where we have been. We have got the year-over-year impact of items like our bonus accrual I mentioned that in our bridge of EBITDA. Compared to last year our bonus and the compensation expenses are going to be up a little bit. Used sales is a significant impact in the second half versus the first. Remember, if you go back to that first quarter our used sales were actually down year-over-year and used sales bring a lower margin than the rest of the company. So as they go down they actually help the flow-through. That was a pretty significant impact in the first quarter. And so that impacted the first half flow-through positively and therefore the second half should be a little bit less. What else, the pump acquisition obviously will be a significant impact I called that out already 4% to 5% impact, depressing the second half and therefore pushing it down versus the first half.","I think the important thing to focus on is the full year flow-through that we expect is still about 60% and that\u2019s including the impact of pump. If you excluded pump the full year would be a little higher. And therefore the second half would be a little higher than what maybe you are calculating just based on the outlook that we have given. And truth told if you have put a gun to my head I said this last night to a couple of folks. If I had best weather it would be little higher or little lower than that 60%. I bet right now maybe a little higher. So I think that flow-through is shaping up nicely for the year.","Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research","That was really helpful. Thank you. And then just components of growth obviously the National Pump impact on mix in the quarter, I think from the Q it says that the mix effect is still a headwind on the general rental side, but just how to think about mix into the back half of the year and sort of net effective of inflation and mix to growth?","Michael Kneeland","But I think if you think about the back half as comparable to the second quarter from a mix impact perspective that will be a good start on how to model it. So as I said earlier about 3.5 percentage points of the 16.8 rental revenue growth that we had came from mix, I think if you did that again for third and fourth quarter that will be a good starting point.","Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research","Great, thanks very much.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Robinson from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna","Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.","Michael Kneeland","You\u2019re welcome.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna","I just want to ask real quick about SG&A and it (picked) up, it sounds like it was mostly incentive comp and I am assuming acquisition out of the costs as well, I was just wondering if there is anything else and that we should be aware of and how you would encourage us to think about the 187 as a run rate going forward?","William Plummer","Nothing else major to call out Tim in SG&A, the incentive comp was the big driver. As you go forward again there is nothing major that I would call after the second half. So I think you can safely use the run rate obviously we will have the impacts of the selling cost based on your revenue estimates, we will have puts and takes incentive line items. But nothing major that we point out.","Tim Robinson \u2013 Susquehanna","Got it. And then real quick if you would hit your rate guidance for the year, what would that imply for a carry over the pricing heading into 2015?","William Plummer","Give me second Tim here and we will dig that up. Its normally in the 2% area maybe a touch higher but we will dig it up real quick and through it out before the call end.","Tim Robinson \u2013 Susquehanna","Perfect. Well, thanks a lot. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Good morning guys. So just a question on CapEx I know we talked a little about the potential for our additional M&A with your free cash flow for the rest of the year, but I am just curious what would cause you guys to take up your CapEx plans from the $1.7 billion for 2017, is there anything or is that pretty much you would say like locked and loaded for the year?","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike and I will ask Matt to join in and Bill too as well. But for me I would like to see both rate and time utilization grow and particularly as it applies to our contribution margin in areas that we can really get nice returns on. But those are probably the two dynamics. That being said it\u2019s also I want to make sure with the management team that we are not just buying for today. We are buying for multiple years. So but they can put that equipment to use longer term and but rate and time utilization that combination may give me the opportunity to think differently.","Matt Flannery","And I think so, this is Matt, Nicole. I somewhat passed earlier about what kind of impact lean could have on OEC NA and OEC not available. So, as we continue to drive our lean initiative throughout the organization we are about 20% to 25% of our stores impacted already. We actually hope will create more capacity for growth within the capital that we have. So, we really have gotten our team away from the thinking that I need $2 of capital to drive $1 of growth revenue and that\u2019s really part of our goal and part of the reason why we want to stay disciplined on our capital spend.","Michael Kneeland","And the only thing I would add, Nicole, is that all of those factors we would mix in along with the impact on cash flow. We take cash flow pretty seriously. And as long as we don\u2019t feel that we are doing significant damage to our cash flow and in the long run we are enhancing our cash flow as a company that would be a factor in deciding to spend more capital as well. Just to go back to Tim\u2019s question about carryover rate if we did 4.5 this year, I think 2% is probably a good number to use right here now. So, just Tim, I wanted to follow up on that.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks for the color on the CapEx guys. And just one more for me, I mean, Mike\u2019s comments about commercial construction were pretty bullish, I am just curious are you guys actually seeing real tangible signs of that recovery or is that more a reflection of just customer confidence and their recovery getting better?","Matt Flannery","Hi, Nicole, it\u2019s Matt again. I would say it\u2019s both. So, you see in our deck that our customer confidence is the best results in our survey that we have seen all year, including last year. And we also have seen a robust pipeline of large projects and that\u2019s a core competency, not just of ours, but of our key accounts. So, we expect to get our fair share plus of participation in those projects. And I had mentioned earlier all the jobs in the power sector and the LNG probably the most renowned one is the (indiscernible) project down in the Gulf Coast, but we have got stadiums popping up in different markets. We have got large retail popping up in different markets and really a robust pipeline of major projects throughout the country.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you guys so much.","Matt Flannery","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Michael Kneeland for closing remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thanks operator.

","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.","Matt Flannery","Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today we\u2019re taking stack of 2019 at the half way point and giving you our thoughts on the balance of the year. And I\u2019ll start with the quarter and then Jess will cover the results, and we\u2019ll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.","We turned in a solid performance in the second quarter at both the top and the bottom lines. This included total revenue growth of 21% compared with Q2 of last year and over a $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA up more than 18%. Our pro forma margin for adjusted EBITDA was up 40 basis points and our EPS was 23% higher than a year ago. ","These metrics underscore the upside of the cycle and the earning power of our largest service offering. Fleet productivity was bolstered by the strength of rate and mix but [dampened] by softer time utilization. This was partly due to a temporary drag from the BlueLine integration. It\u2019s our largest acquisition in nearly a decade. And while the overall integration is going well, it\u2019s taking a little longer than we expected. ","As a result we haven\u2019t been absorbing the fleet and the impacted markets as just quickly as we\u2019d like, and we\u2019ll talk more about this later. Other areas of BlueLine such as cost synergies are coming along as expected. And most importantly, the teams are working really well together. BlueLine is an excellent strategic move for us, one that will drive profitable growth and attractive returns for many years to come. We gained great people and increased our capacity in key geographies. And we\u2019ll update you on the integration progress again in October. ","The other short-term headwind we had throughout the quarter was project delays. Long stretches of heavy rainfall caused a number of large starts to be pushed later but we haven\u2019t seen any cancellations. The delays were more about customers waiting out for bad weather before moving ahead. What we\u2019re not seeing, I'm happy to say, are any indications that demand has fallen. ","Non-residential construction a core end market for us continues to be strong and our regions broadly sight infrastructure and power as major opportunities. Our sales teams are focused on the infrastructure vertical for several years now. In addition to a positive trajectory, the nature of infrastructure makes it right for cross-selling or generate end specialty products. We\u2019re making good in-roads there. ","I\u2019ll share a few additional insights from our regions. Demand on both coasts continued to trend up in Q2 as it has for the past several years. Business hubs like the Carolinas were also strong with online retailers building large distribution centers. Out West, the momentum is being driven by data centers and infrastructure, especially transportation and power is another tailwind. ","The worst of the weather seems to be behind us in the hard hit areas. We expect large projects to start back up in the Central U.S., the Gulf, the Southeast the Mid-Atlantic and it is important to note that the customers remain broadly optimistic about their business regardless of geography. ","Turning to specialty. Our Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions segment continues to deliver robust growth. In the second quarter, the segment generated a 45% increase in rental revenue versus a year ago, and this includes organic growth of almost 13%. And embedded in our specialty growth is significant contribution from cross-selling, which is a way to strengthen our customer relationships. It also moves the needle higher on returns.","Customers want a partner capable of solving multiple challenges on a job site and our ability to provide a full range of solutions is a competitive advantage for us. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, specialty is also key to our commitment to drive superior returns for our investors. It warrants ongoing investment in acquisitions, new equipment technologies and cold starts.","Year-to-date through June, we have opened 24 specialty cold starts, bringing that network\u2019s total to 351 locations and we're tracking just over 30 cold starts by December, which is an increase over our original forecast.","Another area where we are forging ahead is safety. Three months ago, I told you all that, our recordable through March was well below 1. Some companies would be thrilled with that rate, but we've improved it again through June and turned it in the 18th straight quarter with a recordable rate below 1, and that's particularly impressive when you realize the team improved their safety performance during the seasonal surge, while serving customers and working through multiple integrations at the same time.","It\u2019s an indicator that the cultural part of our integration of our acquisitions is progressing faster than anticipated. And I attribute this to the caliber of our employees and the quality of our training.","Turning to our guidance. As you saw yesterday, we trimmed the top end of our ranges for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This accounts for the two impacts I mentioned, the pace of the BlueLine integration and the weather delays.","We also made good on our promise to exercise disciplined capital allocation. Our branches have an opportunity to improve the utilization of the fleet they have in hand. So, we lowered the cost of the CapEx range by $150 million. The biggest take away from the guidance is that we remain confident that our full-year total revenue and adjusted EBITDA will fall within the ranges we set back to January.","So to sum it up, our view on the cycle remains intact. The macro is healthy and the end markets are strong. We delivered solid growth in the second quarter, which kept us on track with our outlook for the full year and we have plenty of runway to capitalize on growth opportunities.","At the same time, we're continuing to position the business for enduring value creation. That's the best way to reward our investors for their confidence in United Rentals by balancing short and long-term growth within the framework of our strategy. We know how to manage the business to achieve this balance and in 2019 we'll continue to deliver.","So now, I'll ask Jess to cover the numbers and then we'll go right to your questions. Jess, over to you.","Jessica Graziano","Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Before I jump into the numbers, on a high level, let me reiterate what Matt said. We have delivered a solid quarter behind a strong market. The team did a great job staying focused on our customers as we managed through some weather delays and as we continue to work through multiple integrations. We're well positioned heading into the back half of the year. ","As with past quarters, while I'll walk you through our as reported results, I'll pivot at times to speak to our performance on a pro forma basis, which includes BlueLine and Baker.","So, let's get into Q2 results. Rental revenue on an as reported basis grew 20% or $329 million to just shy of $2 billion. The increase was primarily related to the impact of both BlueLine and Baker. On a pro forma basis, rental revenue was up in line with our plan at 4.8% for the quarter. ","As reported OER growth contributed about $262 million of the rental revenue increase. Ancillary added $59 million and re-rent added about 8. The OER growth of 19% is comprised of growth in our fleet of 23.2% or about $326 million of additional revenue. We have the usual headwind of fleet inflation at 1.5%, or $21 million, and fleet productivity on an as reported basis was also an expected headwind, down 3.1% or $43 million. ","Now, as you consider the quarter's revenue results, I think it's more helpful to consider fleet productivity on a pro forma basis, which was up about 70 basis points. That came from strong rate and positive mix offset by softer time view. As Matt mentioned, we're still working through some fleet absorption, which was the biggest drag on time views in the quarter, but the team maintained discipline with a focus on profitable growth through the quarter. ","Now while we're talking about fleet productivity, just a reminder that this is the last quarter we will be giving discrete quarterly rate, time and mix details consistent with our previous methodology as a transition to fleet productivity. And you can see all that detail plus calculations supporting fleet productivity on pages 36 through 40 of our investor presentation, which is posted on the website. ","Taking a look at used sales, used sales revenue was about just over 25% or $40 million year-over-year. The used sales environment continues to be strong. When we look versus the second quarter last year, used pricing at retail is up about 2.5%, with used sales as a percentage of OEC a robust 58%. Adjusted gross margin on used sales was 49.2%, down from 51.6. That's largely due to the mix of equipment we sold in the quarter. ","Moving to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.073 billion, an increase of $166 million or 18% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.9%, which is down 110 basis points year-over-year, due mainly to the impact of bringing in BlueLine and Baker. Out more importantly, on a pro forma basis our adjusted EBITDA margin improved a solid 40 basis points. There's a bridge on the as reported changes. ","The improvement in OER added about $150 million. Better ancillary contributed $25 million and we got $4 million more from re-rent. Used sales added about $15 million to adjusted EBITDA. SG&A expenses were a headwind of about $41 million, and that's mostly due to adding the BlueLine and Baker cost basis, net of synergies. That leaves about $13 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit in the quarter, which is primarily coming from better performance in our other lines of business. ","Adjusted EBITDA flow through was right around 60% for the core business, now let me break that down. As reported adjusted EBITDA flow through is 42%. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for BlueLine and Baker in the year ago period, flow through was about 53%. Add to that the impact of Western One and Thompson Pump smaller acquisitions that are not in our pro forma results and you get a flow through of about 65%.","To isolate the core from there I will also exclude the impact of new and used sales as well as the benefit from acquisition synergies. That leaves you with a flow through of right around 60% for the core business and points to stronger cost performance for the quarter and I\u2019m happy to give a shout out for the field for keeping excellent focus on costs. ","As for adjusted EPS a robust $4.74 in the quarter compared with $3.85 in Q2 of \u201818. That\u2019s an increase of 23% primarily from better operating performance across the business including the contribution of our recent acquisitions. Adjusted EPS also was helped this quarter from some discrete tax benefits and lower shares outstanding. ","Let\u2019s move to CapEx and free cash flow. Through the first half of the year we\u2019ve brought in just over $1.1 billion in growth CapEx with $872 million of that having come in during Q2. ","As you\u2019ve seen in our guidance update we expect to trim our original plan for CapEx by about a $150 million at the high end so we expect to come in between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion for the year which compares to $2.1 billion in 2018. ","Free cash flow generated through the first six months of the year is very strong up 11% to $796 million. And just to be clear that number excludes about $16 million in merger and restructuring payments. So we are on track to deliver our full year expectation which we\u2019ve increased in our guidance update. As a reminder we\u2019re now forecasting $1.4 billion to $1.55 billion of free cash flow which compares to a little over $1.3 billion last year. ","Our ROIC for the quarter also strong 10.8% which meaningfully exceeded our weighted average cost of capital. Year-over-year tax adjusted ROIC was down 30 basis points. That expected decline is primarily impacted by the timing drag from our acquisitions. That\u2019s going to moderate as we get their operations more fully integrated and synergies from the deals fully realized. ","Taking a look at the balance sheet, net debt at June 30 was $11.7 billion. That\u2019s an increase of about $2.8 billion year-over-year related to the financing of BlueLine and Baker. Our total liquidity at June 30th was a very healthy $2.15 billion comprised mainly of ABL capacity. Leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. That\u2019s down 10 basis points versus where we were at the end of the first quarter and we continue to work towards ending the year around 2.5 times. ","As a reminder, earlier in the quarter we communicated a lower target leverage range for the company which is now 2 to 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And finally here\u2019s a quick update on our share repurchase program. We purchased $210 million of stock in the second quarter on our current $1.25 billion program which puts us at $840 million purchase to-date. We still expect to complete this program by year end. ","I\u2019ll also note that our total share count at the end of the second quarter was down about 7% year-over-year. When we look at the business pro forma we\u2019re pleased to have delivered a quarter of solid growth and better margins as well as robust free cash flow and strong returns. The integrations are progressing well albeit a little slower than expected and the team did a great job managing through historically bad weather. Most importantly the operating environment remains healthy and our customer confidence measures are positive going into the back half of the year. ","So why the change to guidance? With six months behind us, we would typically look to refine our initial ranges at this point in the year. As we model the impact of what was a slower fleet build than we originally expected in Q2 and we assess our fleet productivity for the rest of the year, the right thing to do was to pullback a little on the growth CapEx. That\u2019s exercising the capital discipline you expect from us. As you take that through the P&L, the highest part of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges are likely out of play and we want to be clear about what we believe we can reasonably deliver for the year.","We're making a modest trend that still has our full year coming in well within our original guidance. And these changes will result and are delivering higher free cash flow than originally expected.","Now, let's move on to your questions. Jonathan, will you please open the line?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the David Raso from Evercore ISI. You question please?","David Raso","Given the quarter at the end, appear to be a little lighter than you thought due to the integration and\/or weather. Can you give us some feel how the quarter starting -- the amount that you tweak the EBITDA down doesn't seem to be extrapolating much of the second quarter disappointment into the back half. So can you maybe just update us on what you're seeing and also obviously the ramifications of the CapEx coming down as well on how you're viewing your metrics for the rest of the year?","Matt Flannery ","David, this is Matt. How are you doing? As you know, we don't give inter-quarter guidance and even though it may be in our favor at some times, we still try to keep that. All I would say is, we are very thoughtful and confident about the guidance that we gave here and here we are a couple of weeks into the quarter. So, you can extrapolate from that what you think.","More importantly, the disruption that we did see, primarily not getting the builds we expected at the end of the quarter in June, we have identified the opportunities to remediate, to repair that. And the change in guidance as Jess said, is really a reflection of where we're starting the second half with the OEC on rent as opposed to any kind of change in the way that we review in the back half of the year. And hopefully that answers your question.","David Raso ","Well, that\u2019s I'm trying to getting comfortable with, if the guidance reduction is sort of second quarter related like sort of what happened during 2Q, but not much change in how you think of the rest of the year, what are the actions to make us comfortable with that? Is that because some projects that were clearly pushed from 2Q are now showing up in 3Q or something the impact of reduced fleet that you're going to bring to different territories? Just to put more color of why we think this is a second quarter isolated just a $25 million EBITDA hit at the midpoint?","Matt Flannery ","Sure. There is a couple of things that we have done. So first half in the markets that were impacted and we talk a little bit -- we took a look at data and we realized that there were some third of markets that has multiple integrations they have been working over the last couple of years. So, what that means to us, there is a lot internal focus where you are re-aligning territories, merging branches, making sure you're protecting the revenue that you acquired which you think done a great job of. We are a little less externally focused on driving new opportunities, new revenue. So, we've repaired that in those markets where that is an issue. We have set the specialty team who continues to show robust growth, more capital and there has been some markets within -- whether they are integration related or not, impact or not, that have been showing solid growth. So, we shifted the capital a little bit.","Overall, we had 13 of our 15 -- even within these headwinds we had 13 of our 15 regions -- geographic regions show positive growth in Q2. So this was more of maybe our expectations of how quickly we were going to move through the fleet, weren't set right or maybe we executed a little softer than we wanted. Either way the remediation is what I'm talking about and what we're focused on. And we feel good that our sales pipelines, the fleet sizes and the appropriate markets are where they need to be for us to deliver the second half.","David Raso ","Are the branch closures related to the acquisitions now behind us, are the things in sales territory and account coverage done. We're just trying to get a sense of you now are facing your busiest season coming up, historically running all the way through October. And we're just trying to get comfortable with the integrations is behind us. And of course, Baker Corp anniversaries this quarter, I mean, third quarter, and BlueLine in the fourth quarter. So we get the mathematical benefits, but operationally, is what we're trying to getting comfort with what is actually truly behind us and done, and what is still left to be done? ","Matt Flannery","Great. structural changes are all done. Sell territories are all done. Customer merges, organizations are all done. So all the structural work is done. Now it's just turning the focus at, how good we\u2019re focused after doing all that heavy lifting. And so all -- there's no more distractions. Team is on-board, projects are starting up where we expected to start up and that's what gives us the confidence for this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question, please.","Ross Gilardi ","Matt, do you have a sense as to how the year-on-year change in your timing would compare to the rest of the industry? And kind of along with that, has the narrative changed at all defending price versus raising price through the seasonally strong period of the year?","Matt Flannery","Yes, I don't want to comment on competitors\u2019 numbers. But you could imagine, I think one reported in April, they were down 1 percentage point. You could imagine the project delays had some temporary impact on utilization for some companies, if they were operating in those impacted areas. So I would expect that, I don't know it for certain. What I can say is if it was extreme, or if it was something that was a bigger concern, we would not have been able -- I don't feel we would have been able to achieve that rate of improvement that we did. And I don't think the industry's rates would be showing up for our rental that we had. It looks like the industry is doing a good job of managing rates. So maybe a little bit wrong. I just don't -- I don't have the details to speak to it. ","Ross Gilardi ","And then can you elaborate a little bit on the used pricing up 2.5% at retail? I mean, there's been a lot of anecdotal commentary on what's happening with used and analyzing the used market from afar, it can be tricky, because you never know if you're looking truly at apples-to-apples. But that seems a little bit better than the overall perception of the market. Can you comment at all like how that's actually been trending over the last several quarters and give any granularity on that earthmoving versus aerials? Any additional color would be helpful?","Matt Flannery","Sure, as you know, a largest proportion of -- extremely large portion of our fleet will be aerial related right, and we sports in that category, where we're over 50%. So that's a good part of our used sales. Pricing held up very strong there. I think the only place where you heard any dampen is surprising at auctions, which is not a channel we utilize, was on some of the large [share]. I don't know what drove that but that didn't impact us whatsoever. We're seeing across the board, that 2.5% that Jess quoted, remember is like-assets to like-asset and we see it as a very robust used sales of end market and we think that points to the demand that we still see in the market place. I think our channel mix gives us an advantage over maybe others in the industry where we\u2019re very focused on retail and that certainly gives us a higher margin achievement. ","Ross Gilardi ","Got it and then the 13 of the 15 regions are up, can you comment on which regions weren\u2019t up, I mean how big a drag they are and whether or not you think that was just truly weather and if those were positive?","Matt Flannery ","Sure the regions where we had -- where we didn\u2019t get the growth and they didn\u2019t fall off quickly, they just didn\u2019t get year-over-year growth, were impacted by both weather and integration. So think about the Gulf States down there where we had a lot of concentration of acquisitions over the past couple of years and they really acted hard with weather. ","I think their job starts should look good, there is still a lot of work on the books. We didn\u2019t -- as I pointed to you in my comments we didn\u2019t see or hear cancellations which that would be a different vibe for us if we were hearing that, we didn\u2019t see that. So I think those folks are drying out and they\u2019ll get back on track for the back half of the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please. ","Steven Fisher","So investors always get more confidence when they see some of your key metrics going in the right direction. So I guess do you think the conditions in your market and your strategy will be supportive of an improvement in fleet productivity in the second half of the year? And is there any sort of directional color you can give us on some of the key underlying components?","Matt Flannery ","Sure Steven. Yes we absolutely feel that fleet productivity will get that to over 1.5 in the third quarter that\u2019s what our expectation is, that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving to. When I look at components of fleet productivity as we\u2019ve always said rate and time are always going to be big drivers. Rate was a good guy this quarter and we feel really good about the rate performance. Mix was as expected. And it was -- we have probably spent a lot of our time both in our prepared remarks and here on the call talking about the time view and we feel once we get that in order we\u2019ll see the fleet productivity that we\u2019d like to target. ","Steven Fisher","And wondering if you could just talk a little bit maybe about AWP, specifically supply demand, it sounded like maybe you had some concerns about the maximum capacity in terms of places. Can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on with that product line? How extensive is any overcapacity and how do you think that plays out in the second half of the year?","Matt Flannery ","Yes we\u2019re not concerned about AWP overcapacity in the market broadly overall. When you think about where we\u2019re not absorbing the BlueLine fleet as fast as we want in the few of those impacted markets, you can imagine the fleet that they haven\u2019t absorbed is priced, BlueLine was 70% aerial. So there are some excess we have in stores but we don\u2019t view this as a macro issue. We don\u2019t take AWP as a whole is -- and we\u2019re still growing our AWP as a company so we don\u2019t think AWP as a whole is a problem for the industry.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup. Your question please. ","Tim Thein","So a question is on the interplay between time and rate. It\u2019s pretty atypical if you look at the history of URI to have this sort of magnitude declines in your pro forma utilization and still get rates that are at or above the rate of underlying inflation. So I am just curious Matt, just may be more kind of a high level thoughts in terms of what you think that\u2019s enabling that? Is it something that, that you have had done at the branch level? Is it something may be a change in the industry structure or something else? So just maybe your thoughts in terms of how you're able to get positive rates? It's pretty significant year-over-year decline in terms of from a percentage standpoint in terms of your time yield.","Matt Flannery","I think it's a continuation of a strong end market and demand that's driving that rate. I think industry discipline gives credit to others not just us. Industry discipline has so much improved in this cycle from the last cycle. And I think those are two big factors. And I also think that growing the time -- the time utilization were down because of demand than may be you would see a different issue. We don't feel our time as we've talked about a last year is a result of the demand. We've figured a little of delays and then $1.5 billion of fleet in November from our BlueLine acquisition. That wouldn't be a normal cadence that we would do.","So, we think it's a result of the timing of the integration and working that through the system than any kind of demand issue and so they really are interplaying as normal because the time was not caused by lack of demand.","Tim Thein","And then may be from a end market standpoint, just your views on the energy patch more broadly. Is that in your expectation in terms of your model for the full year, is that -- has it changed at all, just some of the different components across energy?","Matt Flannery","We're doing fine overall in energy, but when you think about upstream, so, we have been saying for the past couple of quarters that every vertical we track are showing positive growth. The upstream -- the rig count in the upstream throughout the first half of the year, I think rig count from January 1 to the end of June is down about 9%. So, we track very closely for that. So, we did see a decline similar to that in our upstream business. Remind everybody that's still less than 5% of our overall business. But to counter that in energy, our refining business, our downstream business is still very strong, still seeing growth in midstream.","So, overall energy is okay, upstream did have a little drop in the rig recount which impacted revenues a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please?","Joe O'Dea","Matt, can you just expand on, what it is that's driving some of the slower than expected integration with BlueLine and I think relative to seeing even the pro forma utilization that's down year-over-year, even if you were tracking kind of behind maybe we could see that perform a little bit better. So, I'm just trying to understand some of the drivers of that sort of progress. And then even the pro forma declines in utilization? ","Matt Flannery","Sure, Joe. So, when we think about that 2.2 pro forma reduction, it's about half of it that we had modeled in and we knew what's going to take some time to work some of these fleet through the system. As I said, we wouldn't have brought in $1.5 billion worth of fleet in November in a normal case. So, about half of that was expected, half of it unexpected. And when we think about that unexpected, we did a deep dive on some analysis of where we either needed and couple was dependent on the market, right, so, we did a market-by-market deep dive.","In some markets, we weren't getting enough new business in the pipeline. So, we have been addressing that. We load opportunities in our CRM. This is just normal operational blocking and tackling. In some other markets, it was more about sales coverage. We needed to add sales reps, we addressed that. So nothing magical, just normal operational work that we did. And maybe our expectations are this large deal -- largest deal we've done in quite a while of working through this quickly, maybe our expectations were off, I don't know. But either way, the tactics that we're taking through repair are the same that we would have done regardless. ","Joe O'Dea","And do some of the actions that you take now and use set down growth CapEx, I mean does that even includes going in and sort of assessing where some of these pockets of underperformance are? And does that enable redistribution of fleet, so you can actually serve other regions with some of that, and in effect, that will help kind of bring the overall utilization up?","Matt Flannery","Yes, absolutely. So I put that in the expected portion. So where we did expect that capital that we normally would have put in those markets as they absorb the acquired capital, we put into other markets. Where specialty has gotten more capital throughout the year, they continue to use that well. We've had a couple of geographic regions pick up the pace, and they got a couple of -- a little bit more capital. The cut to the top end of our capital was directly correlated to that other 1% that was unexpected. So if you think about, we just had latent capacity that match that $150 million that we cut off the top, and we just thought it was prudent to use that. But it doesn't change the slope of our growth in the back half of the year, if you're following me just the starting point. We just thought was prudent to not spend the capital on that, let the team use the adornment capital to fill that that demand that we expect in the back half of the year. ","Joe O'Dea","And then last one, just how has customer retention experience been as we walk through the process of navigating BlueLine rates in line with URI, is there any impact on customer retention that was showing up in utilization?","Matt Flannery","No, no, we always model some leakage I will say right, in every deal that we've ever done, sure. I think the challenge on this one was that we had your seasonal churn, which is natural, when you go out do integrations as you get into the winter. And then some integration churn and a few of these markets just didn't fill the top of the funnel, so to speak, didn\u2019t backfill that fast enough. But this churn is just natural. We model in every integration we do. But nothing extraordinary, nothing outside of what we expected. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Seth Weber ","I just wanted to tie together a couple of the answers that I've heard so far. I think to Steve's question, you talked about fleet productivity being above 1.5 in the third quarter, which I think suggests these BlueLine issues are kind of in the rearview. But at same time, Matt, I think you're saying like, it sounds like some of this stuff is still in process. And it could bleed into third quarter. So I'm really just trying to understand the cadence of how quickly you think these integration issues can get -- will get fixed, or are they fixed already? I'm just trying to tie these two different data points together. Is productivity going to be about 1.5 in the third quarter, I guess? ","Matt Flannery","So we were never very good at forecasting rate in time. So we stopped doing that a couple years ago. So now I'm going to try to forecast the interplay of rate, time and mix. I can say that what we see in the repairs of markets that we\u2019re challenged and then the growth of markets that we fed more fleet to, make us feel comfortable that our target of 1.5 is in play. We don't want to get into the business. We\u2019re starting to forecast because then I\u2019d remind you about forecast rate and time to the 10 bps and we don\u2019t want to do that. But I think more a color of the demand environment, the reparations to the sort of markets where we had challenges, we feel good about where we\u2019re trending and that\u2019s why we gave the guidance that we gave today or last night. ","Seth Weber ","Okay. I thought you specifically said to Steve\u2019s question that you thought it would be above the 150 that\u2019s all so.","Matt Flannery ","Yes that\u2019s -- if you messed around with the midpoint of our guidance it wouldn\u2019t come out with that implication but we\u2019re not going to -- we don\u2019t want to forecast any number.","Jessica Graziano","Hey Seth it is Jess, I just want to add just one thing. That 1.5% that we talked about kind of goes back to when we introduced fleet productivity the comps that -- just that we want to make sure that we\u2019re being as productive as possible with the fleet but at least covering that 1.5% of inflation, right. So our goal in any quarter is to get that fleet productivity to be greater than the 1.5% inflation that we expect is going to come on the fleet just.","Seth Weber ","Yes makes sense totally, thank you. And then maybe Jess for you, appreciate the color on the adjusted pull through 60% excluding synergies and some of the headwinds and things like that. But as we think about 2020 I mean it seems like these issues should be in the rearview. So is there anything that we should think about that would not allow a 2020 pull through margin to be in that 60% range?","Jessica Graziano","So there\u2019s nothing right now that we can see. We\u2019re going to start the 2020 planning process call it late August and obviously work through. But to your point a lot of what you see as adjustments to that 60% is the acquisition dynamic that plays against that number. Absent that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re seeing right now that will take off of 60% on the core business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. ","Jerry Revich","You folks had really strong free cash flow performance given the negative EBITDA. I'm just wondering how much more room do you have to pivot CapEx lower if you need to have far out, are you committed because Matt to your point earlier on the call in terms of latent capacity given where utilization was in the quarter, you have to go back a while before we see utilization at these levels in 2Q. So presumably I would imagine you folks can turn harder on CapEx if you find that as you head through 3Q, the ramp is at the low end of expectations. Can you just talk to that please?","Matt Flannery ","As we\u2019ve talked about before we have a lot of flexibility in our capital spend. We\u2019re very aligned with our partners and that\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us to make this trim relatively easy. It\u2019s not on our calculus right now to go lower than the range that we\u2019re in. We want to reiterate we feel good about the demand environment and the opportunities that are there. So once we absorb the extra 1% that we didn\u2019t expect and then work the rest of the fleet through our system we think this is the right capital allocation for the end market that we\u2019ll be working in for the rest of the year. ","So is the opportunity there in a different environment? Yes, but I don\u2019t want you to take away that that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed to. ","Jerry Revich","Okay and in terms of has the calculus shifted at all in terms of what\u2019s the optimal level of utilization? We're trying to work towards given the changing fleet mix? Has that evolved at all as we look at the actual time utilization reported for the quarter, given all of the differences we've seen in terms of the move towards specialty in the business? Should we be thinking about a different calculus when we are looking at maximizing returns as it relates to what utilization that ultimately translates to?","Jessica Graziano ","Joe, that's an excellent question and thank you for asking it, because the change in the calculus is really the shift for us to fleet profitability and it's less about targeting a particular time utilization number or particular rate number or particular mix number even. But rather going out in the field and again it is much rate as we possibly can utilizing the fleet to the highest level we possibly can in a way that makes sense. And to the point you're making about specialty, continuing to optimize mix that would come through a more profitable fleet, and more profitable fleet that's going to consistently meet the demand of our customers. So, that calculus shift is fleet profitability and really the interplay that's going to come from continuing to optimize that profitable growth and return that we're after.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger ","It's interesting we haven't talked too much about the macro and it sounds like that was pretty solid and some of the issues you have were largely integration and weather-related. So somewhat unique to the company. Could you address, it sounds like you feel pretty comfortable with the back half of the year but the ABI has been a little bit soft, you mentioned some of your customer discussions that sound solid. So, this is more of a 2020 question, but what lends comfort particularly in non-res but overall?","Matt Flannery","As Jess mentioned, we haven't started our 2020 planning process. But when you look at even the contracted backlog out nine months right, so there is still work there. When you look at, construction employment numbers, I think highest of all time. You look at other indicators including our Customer Confidence Index and the feedback from our 1,200 locations out in the field, the managers and sales reps that get paid to do this every day, we feel good about the end markets. How much that plays in and where that ends in 2020, we will spend a lot of time in the fall taking a look at and obviously that will influence our guidance. But, we do feel good about the end markets.","Scott Schneeberger ","And then, just from the early June press release about the leverage level and you touched a little bit on it again today. But how should we consider the M&A pipeline, given this new target and any material changes as to, you think you're going to slowdown or might there even be expansion in looking internationally, perhaps. Just kind of the big level picture on M&A from here in that light?","Matt Flannery","Sure, Scott. It\u2019s pretty consistent with the way our thoughts have been. We talked about at the end of Q1. We're in much more of a absorbing leverage mode in the generic business as you could see, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about that today. But we certainly have a length perspective to see. If the rights deal comes up, we're very, very interested in any kind of specialty acquisition that can meet our threshold, right, very high bar both culturally, strategically and most importantly financially. But we really like to space. And if we can get some new products, or build out of a footprint that we think would be more efficient for us to do it through M&A versus an add back to the organic growth we're showing, I would say that's where our lean would be. Internationally, we're still moving very slow. We have got a great team that's there. We are international. Now with 11 stores, we got the Baker acquisition, they're doing a great job. But we're going to continue to take a watch and learn mode before we go dive deep into the pool. And we'll update folks once we feel that there's a pivot from that position.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Courtney Yakavonis","I just was curious how cross selling performed this quarter relative to your executions? It sounds like a lot of the comments on the integration have been really about protecting some of the acquired revenues. So just you say that you did see cross selling just on the line of acquisitions? ","Matt Flannery","Yes, we saw double-digit growth in cross selling, still strong performance. I think that's one of the areas we could pick up as part of the revenue opportunity that we have. We've got obviously some new reps teams that weren't as familiar with the full offering. And that's part of the training that we've been focused on here in the past quarter, to get folks trained on what the full value prop that we have as we've added new players to the team, whether they would be just growth or through M&A. ","Jessica Graziano","And Courtney the other thing I'd add there is that that's a big component of the leveraging of the acquisitions that we've done is to really focus on cross selling and bringing that broader breath of products and service to our customers.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then along the same lines, you guys increased your specialty portfolio from 27 to 30. One, if you can just comment on how the mix of growth CapEx has been altered because of your reduction? If it\u2019s going to be more focused on specialty, now if any specialty CapEx was reduced? And then also, just what's the CapEx impact from additional cold start just kind of per unit?","Matt Flannery","Yes, there's not a big for the additional three cold starts, it\u2019s not big trade in fact but we did increase specialty as a whole number. And then obviously, as a percentage, because none of the -- none of us regardless of where we end up in that range is going to come out of specialty, we actually upped their CapEx for the full year, based on the growth that they have shown.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then just last one, I think you just talked about some of the training associated with the sales force as part of the territory realignment. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what specifically you see in terms of training sales force?","Matt Flannery","I couldn't hear you too well.","Jessica Graziano","She said training of this. Did you say training, Courtney? ","Courtney Yakavonis","Yes. Yes. ","Matt Flannery","Okay. Yes, the ongoing, we have a very broad and deep curriculum of training for both new employees and for higher level sales professionals. So we have a training tailored to them all. I would just say that part of the part of the biggest opportunity that folks new to the organization, even though if they were in the business before is the breadth of products that you have to sell and how do you use that. In the product specialist we have to solve more problems of your customers to get more share of wallet, deeper penetration. That's more of what our focus is on a go forward basis. And as part of why we continue as you brought up the first question, strength in cross sell and growth in our specialty business.","Courtney Yakavonis","I'm sorry, one last one. In any of the markets where you could do an acquisition have you become the sole provider. And is that having any impact on customers, who might want a second provider of equipment?","Matt Flannery ","Yes these are all annual contracts other than when you use three bids in a buy for like a large petrochem player and none of our customers are beholden to any of us in the industry to be a sole provider. So even if someone told they were, I don\u2019t know that I could tell you definitively on a live call that we are the only provider. But we are fortunate that because of the breadth of our product offerings and our network there\u2019s very few areas of North America or pieces of equipment that we can slide to our customers so we think that gives us a really strong share of wallet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ramsey from Thompson Research. Your question please. ","Steve Ramsey","Thinking about specialty, are you adding much fleet to the Baker branches and how is fleet absorption at Baker and is the integration on pace there?","Matt Flannery ","The integration after Baker\u2019s will allow -- in addition to our fluid solutions team, we added Thompson Pump. So you could imagine we\u2019re pretty well settled on pumps already. Baker was already the leading tank provider in the industry. So what we\u2019re adding to that are additional products and services like filtration and really building a comprehensive innovative fluid solutions business as we pull together a great pump business and a great tank business.","Steve Ramsey","And just thinking about the leverage range at this juncture where we are in the cycle, your optimism about the cycle and the free cash flow profile? What at this point when things are good would cause you to lean to operating at the low end of the leverage range?","Jessica Graziano","Well we\u2019ve talked about when we made the change to reduce the range to 2 to 3 times. Two things. The first was we were still planning to come in somewhere around 2.5 times by the end of this year. So that is coming down from call it 3 times post the BlueLine deal at the end of last year. So we have made conscious decisions to continue to get that leverage down through 2019. As we look forward into 2020 we\u2019re going to continue to focus on moving more towards the end of our new leverage range. I'm not sure exactly where we\u2019ll fall but it\u2019ll be a focus for us as we think about the free cash flow in 2020 that we expect will be again another robust year of free cash flow generation. As we think about how much of that will go to leverage it\u2019ll be a priority for us to continue to take the leverage down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is our final question for today and it comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Chad Dillard","So sorry to beat the dead horse here. But just want to go back to the under absorption of 1%. I just wanted to understand just like what\u2019s baked into the balance of the year? So I think you talked about plus or more than 1.5% productivity number for 3Q. I just wonder if that\u2019s actually contemplated in that as well as at the back end the guidance? And to kind of get that under absorption taken care of, is the case that some of the pent-up demand from to 2Q the delays kind of come through and take care of that or is it more about some of the sales force that was more under the phasing on deal negotiation move forward, how does that phasing and aims differently work?","Matt Flannery","Sure. So, it's about -- and in addition to the absorption in the markets where we needed the sales force to fill the top of the funnel as I say, to utilize that tone of capacity they had is one fixed. But it's also shifting at the markets where we had robust growth and where we have opportunities in not just specialty but other geographic markets where they weren't as a bit impacted. We talked about the California in the first quarter and then we've about how they rebounded. They had a real slow start to the first quarter and they've had robust growth on the West Coast here in the second quarter and we forecast that to be beyond.","So, it's really just management of our business\u2019 normal cadence for us. The only reason we called out these specific drags just because they were abnormal and the opportunity to repair them exists because of the demand that's out there. So, that's the real good news.","Otherwise, if we weren\u2019t in a strong demand environment, it would be a different play call it all together. I just want to reiterate the strong demand environment, the strong rate, the opportunity for growth in the back half of year that we're guiding to is our opportunity, so -- and then the output will be that fleet productivity target that we talked about.","Chad Dillard","That's helpful. And then you mentioned that at the top of the call that infrastructure was a source of strength. So just trying to understand I guess how much bigger does that part of the business grow as we look kind of towards at the balance of the year in 2020? And like how do you think about potential mix shift for the impact? I guess I\u2019d like to follow up for Jessica.","Matt Flannery","So, we think first of all, the infrastructure growth isn't so much as there is tailwind all over the end markets growing. It's also our focus on it. So, we started focusing on infrastructure as a vertical and tailor to go-to-market strategy for that, as well as product strategies, because we knew there was just such demand and need for infrastructure improvements throughout the country.","So that's paying off and it's a great example of opportunities, where even as end markets may have slower growth, as we have vertically focused our sales teams and our product offerings to end markets where we think our offering benefits more than the competition, we could actually swim upstream in some of these markets and we did that for a little while in infrastructure and that was some tailwinds.","How much it ends up? What size of our business is it? Really the focus, it's more of we have the core products like trench, like fluid solutions to go along with our genuine products to really support that customer base.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back for any further remarks.","Matt Flannery","Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining us today.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. We would like to cover today starting with a strong second quarter. Our results reflects some of the best fundamentals we\u2019ve seen in the years. Some of that external but a lot of it comes from executing well at the Company.","I also want to talk about market demand, which has been stable at the high level. And we have some thoughts on how 2017 and 2018 will play out and then as the guidance that we gave an update last night.","So let's start where we are today. Now I want to mention four metrics that are especially meaningful and then Bill will discuss them in detail for the quarter. Now, our metric is our volume, pro forma for NES volume in the second quarter was up 6.6% and we have a similar increase in the first quarter which points to a healthy marketplace.","Rates another good story, we achieved positive rates trend across our business in the quarter with sequential improvements each month, and we're close to being positive on our rates year-over-year, but don't expect us to rest. rates will continue to be a major area of focus for us. Our employees understand how critical it is at this part of our strategy. Importantly, the gains around RATES, we also increased time utilization to a new record of 69.4%. This is the highest time utilization of any second quarter in our history. In fact, each month set a new record.","And finally, our free cash flow. Through June stands at a robust $614 million, which is right on-track and that's after $968 million of growth CapEx spend. These are excellent metrics that show how effectively we are running the Company. Our people look at everyday managing the business with discipline right to the height of the NES integration.","So one thing you will notice as we go through the call is that we're no longer talking about standalone NES in United Rentals. While the integration is ongoing, we are now operating at one organization. And we have made a great deal of progress on a $40 million of cost synergies we identified in April as Bill will discuss.","So I'll give you some of the operational milestones. The back-office sale and operating teams are now fully integrated and the branches have moved onto our management systems. We're in the process of training our new employees on salesforce.com and our rate management tools. We're rolling out right optimization technology for deliveries and a special training is underway.","We're also installing Telematics on the acquired fleet and we're about 10% through the retrofit program with Telematics installed on over 2500 machines. But one of the most important parts of the integration has nothing to do with equipment. Back when we bought NES we noted that our two companies share a strong sticky culture. While I'm pleased to say that last month. We had the safest June on record.","We recently finished the series of [town homies] (Ph) for over 1000 employees in our combined Company. For some, this is the first Town Hall and their first chance to meet Company executives. And we opened these meeting to comments on safety, operational excellence, technology and communication and as always our employees are not shy about forcing their opinions.","I was pleased to see so many different prospective put out there and we're always willing to change how we do things if there is a better way and the Town Halls help us schedule it. So NES has turned out to be a strong fit and we bought them at the right time.","Now our performance this quarter was about more of an NES, our entire industry is in a growth cycle. Customers need more equipment and we\u2019re in front of them with a bigger fleet and a larger footprint. Key indicators such as the Dodge Momentum Index, the AVI and construction backlogs are all positive.","Spending on commercial construction remains strong and to forecast of the U.S. equipment rental industry overall has continued growth over the next few years. Two former drags on demand have turned the corner, one is upstream oil and gas where the inflection point we saw last quarter has been sustained and the other is Canada.","Western Canada seems to have stabilized and eastern provinces are going strong. Internationally rental revenue was up 7.3% in the quarter and volume was up 8.8% with improving rate trends. That\u2019s the strong as growth we seen in Canada and eight quarters.","In the U.S. our largest revenue gains continue to come from two coast, in New England for example, more than $5 billion of large projects are either starting or ramping up in the third quarter following a strong spring. These range from Casinos and plant expansions to office complexes. In the West we're seeing multiyear project for entertainment venues and large corporate campuses. And in the South East, its automotive plants, data centers, infrastructure and manufacturing.","Another fourth indicator is our customer confidence index, in June the level of optimism remains strong with a maturity of our customers indicating that they expect our business to improve over the next 12 months and we go right to the same conclusion. In our opinion the cycle has substantial runway ahead.","Now turning to specialty, our Trench, Power and Pump segment continues to outperform underpinned by strong organic growth. In the second quarter, the segment revenue increased 19% year-over-year primarily on same store basis and gross margin improved by 250 basis points to 49.6%.","Our Pump Solutions business had now standing showing with revenue up more than 37%, some of this is due to the rebinding upstream oil and gas, but they are also getting traction on other verticals. And we will continue to expand our specialty network with a total of at least 17 cold starts this year, seven of those are operating now, bringing our specialty footprint to 224 locations out of a total of 960.","Our specialty cold starts tend to hit the ground running in part because many of our existing accounts needs solutions that are outside the scope of general construction. This helps to differentiate us a premium rental provider. Four years ago, in 2013 specialty accounted for 10% of our rental revenue in the second quarter. This year, the number was 19%, so specialty rentals are becoming increasingly important to our business.","Another initiative is well tie in for the up cycle is Project XL. Project XL is a tool kit of work streams focus and driving improved profitability and we are targeting $200 million of run rate by year end 2018. All the pilots are complete and we are phasing them into the operations.","And before I hand it over to the Bill, I want to spend a minute on guidance that we issued yesterday. It raises our 2017 outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, capital spending and free cash flow. We are confidence that the market will support our higher expectations for revenue and EBITDA. And we've allocated another $100 million of CapEx to make sure that we can meet that demand.","It helps to our industry continue to be more disciplined about repurchases and the supply of available rental equipment is being absorbed into the marketplace. And when we look at third-party data, we're encouraged by the broader industry is getting rates improvement as wellness growth and demand continues to outpace and supply, our rates dynamics are likely to benefit.","I think my core comment this morning to convey not only the broad scope of the opportunity we had, but also how well positioned we are to take advantage of it. The decisions we make are designed to balance growth with margins, free cash flow and returns to maximize our long-term value. In the second quarter, we showed that we can achieve this balance across the business. Now as we entered the busiest period, we see even more potential to convert our strategy into value for our shareholders.","So with that, I will ask Bill to cover the numbers and then we will go to Q&A. So over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks Mike. And good morning to everyone. As Mike said, we got a lot of information this morning on the second quarter, a lot going on in the quarter. I'll try to give you normal color on the information that we usually report. We have also had lot of questions about NES and the impact there, so we will try and carve-out where we can information there that would give you sense of how NES is going for us.","Let me start though as usual with rental revenue in the quarter $1,367 million was up and $163 million or 13.5% over last year. The components driving that were I will start with the ancillary revenue had a good quarter there with ancillaries adding $21 million over last year really driven by volume partly from NES, but just the raw volume of the more fleet on rent as well as the higher revenue from delivery and fuel associated with rentals.","Re-rent was a positive too year-over-year, basically volume related there as well, but the bulk of that $163 million was the owned equipment revenue growth, within that $140 million from OER growth, $181 million contribution from volume, so really strong quarter in getting mostly on rent.","RATES cost is about $13 million of decline year-over-year that from the 1.2% reported decline in rental rates versus last year. Our replacement CapEx inflation was $16 million in the quarter and then at left $12 million of unfavorability from mix and all other and there is a lot going on within the mix and other column this quarter, you will see that when we get through the bridge for EBITDA year-over-year, the addition of NES as well as other mixed factors like class and period mix.","So those are all the key components to the revenue change year-over-year. Let me just take a minute to say a little bit more about our rates for the quarter and the impact of NES within that rates. It's a very difficult question to try and address how much the NES impact our rates for the quarter.","Obviously the 1.2 as reported decline in rates reflects the fact that we didn't have any extra in the last year period, but we did in this year. And as you all know and you've heard us say before NES rates came in lower than United Rentals\u2019 rates and so it's had a drag affect on the reported 1.2 decline.","You can see that by comparing that 1.2 decline to the pro forma rate performance which was a 40 basis points decline, with pro forma being defined as NES was put into the last year period as well as this year period. So that difference just gives you a sense of how much the addition of NES rates weigh down the as reported number.","When we dig in and try and identify exactly what happened to the NES rates period-over-period, what happened to the legacy United Rentals rates period-over-period. It becomes very difficult to really carve things out that way. We\u2019ve integrated NES very rapidly, the fleet has moved tremendously, we\u2019ve consolidated branches and all of that just makes it really hard to say what is NES and what is United Rentals.","But we still want to give you an indication, so what we did was we look at the regions in our business our U.S. gen rent business, where there was no NES impact. And we had three regions where there was either exactly zero or very close to zero impact from adding NES. Our pack west or Midwest and our south regions.","For those three regions, when you look at their year-over-year rate performance, they were down three-tenth, very similar to the overall pro forma decline of the total company. So that gives us a sense that we were moving rates effectively in the right direction, both for areas that were impacted by NES and areas that were not.","In fact if you look at the months of the quarter and look at the monthly sequential rates for those three regions combined. Those are pretty solid month, they had an April sequential of 20 basis points positive, 70 basis in May and 120 basis points in June. So nice improvements in rates even away from where we had impacts from NES. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more flavor for what the rate picture looks like both in the areas affected and the areas not affected.","Let me move down to used equipment sales. $133 million of used proceeds in the quarter that was essentially flat with last year and delivered an adjusted gross margin of 52.6% which was up robustly 4.8 percentage points versus last year. Here again, there is an impact of NES, we just wanted to try and call out for you.","Within the 133 of proceeds was included $15 million of proceeds from the sale of what had been NES equipment. That accounted for about $32 million of original cost equipment from NES sales. That NES sales impact we estimate at something like $6 million of benefit to the adjusted gross margin. So that will give you a sense of what happens when you are selling the NES fleet, which as I'm sure most of you know typically is older fleet, they operated with an older average age of the fleet, so it generated more robust margins than maybe we would have got out of our legacy United Rentals sales.","They also had a more rapid depreciation schedule that also contributed to the book value being lower and therefore the contribution to adjusted profit from use being higher. All of the sales continue to happen in a robust market environment, our pricing experience is still pretty good within United Rentals and that compares to market pricing that our indication is still pretty good as well. In fact in the quarter, we sold equipment at a little over 89.5 months of age and we still realize 54% of the original cost for the sales this quarter. So pretty robust pricing environment for used equipment sales overall.","Let me move to our adjusted EBITDA performance in the quarter $747 million in the quarter that\u2019s up $68 million compared to last year and the components of that $68 million increase were as follows. Volume, again the big story, $121 million positive over the last year, only offset by about roughly $13 million of rental rate decline that I called out in the revenue bridge. The ancillary gains contributed about $11 million at EBITDA and they were just about enough to offset the fleet inflation headwind that we normally experienced, that fleet inflation was about $12 million of headwind in the quarter.","Used equipment sales year-over-year contributed $7 million, we did have our normal a merit increase that was a headwind of $6 million, we did also in the quarter have a bonus accrual increase as we adjusted our bonus programs to reflect the better performance of the Company year-to-date and what we expect for the full-year. That increase in bonus accrual cost us about $14 million compared to last year.","Earlier in the year we said that - back in the first quarter we said that we thought that the bonus accrual adjustment this year would cost us about $27 million over the entire year, our view now is that it will be more like a $38 million impact for the entire year compared to last year and again that\u2019s reflecting the improved performance of the business overall.","The last piece of the bridge to %68 million was mix another and that\u2019s a complicated story, this quarter given the addition of any of NES fleet and NES transactions to our results. NES revenue came in at a lower average dollar yield. NES revenue came in with all of the NES fixed cost and all of those things count against the mix and others. So mix and other was a decline year-over-year of $26 million versus last year which made up the last piece of that $68 million year-over-year change.","Let me take a minute here to try and carve out the impact of NES at revenue and EBITDA just to give you a sense of how its playing through the quarter. Again, I\u2019ll emphasize that this is a very challenging thing to do because of the integration. But what we did here was to look at the individual assets that were brought in with NES acquisition and track those assets to get a sense of the revenue they generated during the quarter.","So when you do that you get a rental revenue impact from those assets of about $87 million, so obviously you can debate all day whether it is just tracking the assets will give you the real revenue impact of adding NES, but we think that's the fairest way that we can think of to try and categorize what the revenue impact is.","So $87 million of rental revenue impact and then beyond that we'll add to at the $15 million of used equipment revenue that I called out earlier and then we had $3 million or so of other revenue gains from the NES addition. So all together that's $105 million worth of revenue that came with NES acquisition or were the direct result of the acquisition.","It gets harder to say what that means in adjusted EBITDA terms obviously because it get's difficult to allocate cost and to carve them out specifically to NES exclusive, right it's easy to do in an NES location, but when the fleet moves, how do you allocate cost?","Still we took a turn at it just to have a framework for thinking about the EBITDA impact and we come up with the number that's about $46 million of adjusted EBITDA that we would attribute to NES. So $105 million for revenue and $46 million for EBITDA.","If you look at the flow through in the quarter, our flow through for the total Company was 38.6% year-over-year and obviously if you use those any NES numbers for revenue and EBITDA you can back those out to get a sense of the flow through of the Company when you exclude the NES impact.","That number calculates out to about 31% flow through in the quarter and I know some of you are thinking okay 31% that's not great for the business ex-NES what is going on. Well I remind everybody that that flow through is impacted by the rate performance of legacy business, it's impacted by the differences in used equipment sales this year compared to the last year, its impacted by the differences in the amount of other lines of business revenue and profitability this year versus last year and of course it's impacted by the $14 million of the incremental bonus approved that I talked about previously.","If you take an estimate of all of those factors which we did and add the back as appropriate to the legacy URI business, you get to a flow through that looks lot like 50% that we've always talked about. So our feelings bottom line is that the business is performing well both for the legacy URI business and the NES\u2019 added business and we are going to continue to look for improvement still.","Let me move really quickly to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was $614 million as Michael pointed out excuse me that's year-to-date, as Michael pointed out that's down from last year by $178 million, the big driver there was the increase in rental CapEx, our gross rental CapEx was $913 million year-to-date period and that alone was up $190 million.","So that was the biggest driver, there were puts and takes in other areas obviously EBITDA improved, our interest expense improved, but our cash taxes went up as the you all remember that we burned up for NOLs during the course of the last year.","That cash flow picture brought our net debt for the quarter - at the end of the quarter to $7.9 billion that was up from last year and it was up from where it was at the end of the last year and the primary driver of the increase obviously was the addition of NES, the purchase of NES offset by the free cash flow that we've generated so far year-to-date.","Let me touch on Project XL real quickly. As Michael mentioned, we're making good progress there. We have the eight work streams well underway, some of which had pilots ongoing that now have been completed. And we feel good about what they are delivering in terms of the impact versus what we had in our targets.","We took a turn at giving you a little bit more information about two of the work streams in our Investor deck. I'll point you all to that page and those work streams, one would to growth and infrastructure vertical and other is just continuing to drive our labor productivity. And certainly we can address in the Q&A if we have questions. But the big message is that we're on-track to deliver the $200 million impact from these initiatives that we talked about at our Investor Day that run rate by the end of 2018.","I will remind you, I said this back in December, this is not $200 million of incremental EBITDA that you can just add on top of what you otherwise would model. Some of these initiatives are part of how we're going to continue to drive profit improvement in our Company and so you need to carve out which ones are add-ons and which ones are just part of the ongoing base business and as we get further into them we'll talk more about how you might frame that.","The NES integration just real briefly there, it is going gone very well as Michael mentioned. We're on-track to deliver the $40 million of cost synergies by the end of 2018 that we called out at the deal. And based on the actions that we've actually taken so far this year, we would say that we've realized in the second quarter about $2.5 million worth of synergies from those actions. And the run-rate as we sit today is nicely on the path we delivering that $40 million by the end of this year.","We should realize this year something between $15 million and $20 million of actual impact in 2017, and again that's including the $2.5 million that we've already realized in the second quarter. So well on our way on the cost synergies. By the way also on the procurement savings that we called out, we gave $5 million to $10 million range at the deal, and we believe we'll be at the higher end of that range when it's all set and going.","Let me finish up real briefly with our guidance, you've all seen the numbers so I won't repeat the numbers. But just looking at the midpoint changes for a total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Total revenue went up to $175 million adjusted EBITDA of $78 million at the midpoints. The big driver of both of those increases were rate and volume out there. Obviously you see it in the numbers in the bridges for second quarter and year-to-date, our expectation is that those will continue to be a big drivers for the remainder of the year.","There will be puts and takes of other ins and outs, but it's really going to be a story about rate and time. The $100 million of gross capital that Michael mentioned that we're adding, we added to both ends of the range, but you really should think about $1.6 billion as being our focused target for CapEx this year and obviously as we always have we will be very mindful to not spend that if we're not seeing the performance of the business shape up the way that we would like and neither we'll be afraid to come back and move it higher if we see the business performing better than our expectation right gearing that.","And then finally on free cash flow, the $25 million increase just reflects some refinements of our estimates as we refine our views of cash taxes and working capital are probably the primary changes along with the operating profitability improvement that we pointed to. It\u2019s a lot, I know but we certainly wanted to give you as much as information as we could in a complex forward. It was a good quarter though and one that we're very pleased with and look to continue that momentum as we go into third and fourth quarter.","So with that I'll stop my comments and ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks good morning guys. This time last year you guys got a little bit of pricing for a couple of months and then it just sort of attracts seasonality for a while. What if anything is different this time and why?","Matthew Flannery","Hey Ross this is Matt, it\u2019s a fair question and one that we've asked ourselves to make sure that we maintain the momentum. I would say what is different is a couple of things. Number one and most important the demand environment and not just for us the work we're seeing in the industry, information that we're looking at looks like absorption continues to drive positive in the industry which is a good indicator.","The other things is the record time utilization that we\u2019re experiencing and then thirdly we have growth this year and we didn\u2019t have this kind of growth and whether you want to use the stand alone or the pro forma number that that was not really the same story last year. So there is a lot of indicators as well as a strong end market macro environment that we feel should be very, very helpful to maintain momentum that we had versus last year.","Michael Kneeland","Ross, I would only add that last year we were going through really still adjusting to the fleet and balance and we're in a much better place in the industry today.","Ross Gilardi","Got it thanks guys and then just a follow-up, you guys have acquired NES and there seems to be a lot of midsize M&A happening, I mean does it feel like we're on the cost of a more substantial wave of consolidation in this space.","Michael Kneeland","Ross you know I've already said that the consolidation would continue to play out inside of our industry it's very fragmented. I think it speaks more to people have strategies as we do and they all do as well. The market cycle, I think it speak volume that their belief the market cycle is still there. And I also sit back and say from a strategy point and from an industry point of view, having increased professional management, I think will overall be a benefit to the industry collectively.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks Guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","Good morning. It's been probably 2.5 to three years since you had at the same time year-over-year growth and utilization rate and CapEx, it looks like we're about to - we are on the cuts of getting back to that. Given done that since like 2013, 2014 and you're doing 60% incremental EBITDA margin. So as much as I appreciate pull this out pull that out, you say we're kind doing that right now. But still it is what it is, incremental right now or 30% to 40%, 50% that want to pull out the bonus accrual, but still the power of having those three things going the same direction into 2018, can you try to handicap for us how we should think about incremental EBITDA margins and why they want to be materially stronger?","William Plummer","Sure Ross, I think materially stronger obviously would be the result of all of those things going together throughout 2018 as you said and rate will be an important driver there, how much of the a rate improvement could we see in 2018 as that would be the critical question about how the flow through might transfer out. Look I mean the analysis that we did, there a lot of assumptions to it, so I don\u2019t want to go too far with the specific about 50% statements that I made.","But at the same time if we get rate to be mildly positive, if we continue to improve utilization, although that's big given the record nature of what we are doing now, but daily improve it just marginally and we are putting more growth capital into the business again that's an assumption not saying we are there yet.","But all those things are lining up, 50% is I wouldn't say a given, but it's certainly the starting point of the discussion about where flow through could go next year. All of that of course need a market that will support all the assumptions that I just went through.","David Raso","Yes I\u2019m just trying to set up a base case, I mean to push back could be well back then you were getting a lot of rates in some utilizations that mix next year is probably hard to assume the same kind of rate growth that you had back then, but that said you also have some farther for cost improvement with NES and so forth. So not to ask you to give 2018 CapEx guidance right now, but can you help at least sort of frame how we should be thinking about growth CapEx or total CapEx however you want to describe it for 2018 just for base case.","William Plummer","Yes, David, it's still early for us to be thinking about that, we are talking about that, we are certainly thinking about it as we speak, but I would say that the momentum this year continues into late into the year, I think it's very reasonable to say that 1600 is the starting point for the discussion, all right and then we'll see where we go from there.","David Raso","One last quick one then Bill, in the month of June alone, we're talking pro forma on rental rates, were there any regions or how many regions, what percent of the regions actually already positive on rates year-over-year, for just the month of June pro forma?","William Plummer","For the month of June pro forma year-over-year, I can quote the sequential, but the year-over-year in the month of June, looks like it's five of regions that were positive and four of the ones that were not positive, another three or four were reasonably close to the breakeven.","David Raso","And remind us, you run the Company with how many regions exactly?","William Plummer","13","Michael Kneeland","13","Matthew Flannery","13","David Raso","13, so, basically five out of 13 up a few more kind of flattish and other ones are still the drag. Okay, I appreciate it. thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes in the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.","Timothy Thein","Great, thank you. Just to follow on that last point, can you quantify within the sort of what the two drags as you called out there, I guess not a region comments per say, but just energy and I guess you find that the braches that are in those heavy oil and gas regions and then I don\u2019t know if you can extend that to upstream. But if you kind a bucket energies as a broad kind of segment, and then just Canada as a whole. Just given the movement in the currency, I'm guessing, we shouldn't just use the difference between the 73 and 88 that you outlined. So maybe just help us in terms of those two drag that you called out. In terms of what they detracted from rates in the quarter?","Matthew Flannery","Sure thanks and this is Matt. I'll answer the upstream conversation first. So as you can imagine, as we\u2019ve seen land rig count continue to decline, our upstream businesses climb. So we were up 68% year-over-year in Q2. That brings us to just under 5% of our total portfolio. So to answer your other questions if you want to look at our total energy exposure, we have about 5% of our business in upstream. About a little less than 2% midstream and about 7% in the downstream business.","So that that nets to a little under 12, technically 11.5% of what you would call energy exposure. And we're very, very comfortable at that level and we're encouraged to see the upstream and we've seen a lot of pickup in our pump business specifically in that sector as well as other verticals within the pump business. As far as Canada, our Canadian business is kind of tailored to cities, but all of the provinces actually had some growth.","We're little bit more challenged in Alberta, when you look at the country as a whole, our rental revenue was up 7.3% and that\u2019s almost 9% just under 9% volume, but still over 3% rate drag year-over-year on that business. But we feel really good about Eastern Canada and we feel that the other provinces in the Western Canada have bottomed out and some of the regions would follow a little bit. So we're encouraged by that.","Timothy Thein","Okay. And Matt, just can you remind us how quickly you would expect to re-price the NES book. And I'm guessing that a little shorter contract duration than maybe legacy URI. But can you just update us there in terms of the re-pricing opportunities with NES.","Matthew Flannery","Yes, we're not really looking at it as just re-pricing NES. We look at our pricing, it makes us a little bit unique as far as in customer buckets geographies and products. And so we're not really parsing out the NES, there are some key accounts with NES that we will treat probably a little more gradually just as we would our key accounts business at United Rentals.","But overall, we're looking at these customers blended, we're emerging our rate zones, we're harmonizing our pricing and we're merging a customer accounts. So it won't be long before we only and really be able to identify that and NES and United Rates. We have a rate strategy as a Company that stays from the segments we talked about and we're going to deploy that across the board.","Timothy Thein","I appreciated it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi good morning. First question just on the specialty side, and I appreciate that we're right on the heels of NES. But as you see in the headlines a little bit step up activity on the M&A front. Just what you are seeing on the landscape there in the 2018 plans. You had talked about back in December and that included some inorganic growth in specialty. And so maybe just kind of where you're seeing that environment right now?","Michael Kneeland","Well first and foremost, we don't talk about the acquisition other than the fact that we do have a robust backlog things that we're looking at. With regards to specialty as a whole as you can see going from 2013 to Today in second quarter from 10% to 19% and the growth capital that we're putting in there along with the cold start. We have a very firm strategy of growing that business and we\u2019re going to continue to fund it.","I think it differentiates us in a different way and our customer is obviously are very open to it. But we're always looking both for market opportunity, we're looking at potential acquisitions and we\u2019re also looking at different product mix that we could do within the specialty group. So it's all the above, but it's going to continue to grow.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Thanks. And then the in terms of just tone of the industry it looks like the survey results may be step down a little bit not sure if that\u2019s just tying run up and then come back down. But and may be just kind of adjustment what we're seeing in a reported survey results and then in general kind of what you are hearing from customers and some other confidence that\u2019s contributing to 2018 positively.","William Plummer","I would say we continue, whether it\u2019s the customer index, whether it's any of macro data we looked at or whether its intelligence we gain on absorption of fleet and rate improvement in the industry, everything is pointing to a strong environment for the balance of the year and we see that playing into 2018. that\u2019s the framework in which we\u2019re making our business decisions and we really haven\u2019t seen much to challenge that. There may be a pocket here and there by sector by vertical, but overall we\u2019re very encouraged with the demand outlook for the future.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, just to be clear, our customer index if you are referring to that it is strong, March was unusually strong and therefore it may look like it was dropping but fact that it is very strong.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Nicole DeBlase","Good morning. So my first question is just around the revenue outlook and I know you guys are refraining from providing explicit rate guidance, totally understand that but is there any way you can kind of frame the way the back half plays out according to the low end and high end of your guidance with respect to like normal rate seasonality like this is a normal seasonal outcome, is it better, is it worst.","Michael Kneeland","Nicole as you can imagine challenging when we don\u2019t want to be explicit about rate and time guidance. What I would say is that we\u2019re not making heroic assumptions about where rates goes in the back half of the year in that revenue guidance. Its well within the range of sequential that assume as well within what we've done historically and so we feel like we got a comfortable set of assumptions there, that\u2019s about as far as I think we should go.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay no doubt that\u2019s really helpful actually and then secondly just around the CapEx, the increase in the full-year guidance. And can you just talk a little bit about like equipment categories or you know priorities of spending for that new incremental bit of CapEx.","Matthew Flannery","Yes Nicole this is Matt. I would say that it's going to be fairly consistent with what our fleet profile is, we\u2019ll continue to put about 20% of that incremental capital into our specialty business and specialty will continue to grow a little bit faster than our Gen Ren, if you look at Q2 we think that will continue. When you look at the rest of the mix whether you\u2019re trying to model whether it will more aerial or more dirt or more of the other, it will be across the board very similar to our fleet profile as a company.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Seth Weber","Good morning guys. Just going back to Tim's question first, is there any way to frame kind of what the starting point is here for the delta between URI's pricing and the NES pricing just so we understand kind of where you are starting yet and where NES prices could come up to? And also I would kind of tack on if there is an average length of NES contract.","William Plummer","Yes, Seth, it's challenging to think about of how to frame the impact beyond what we gave already, right. I think I recommended to somebody last night that if you sit down with a simple spread sheet and make some reasonable assumptions about what the share of business that NES contributes both this year and last year, you can frame out sort of in broad terms how to get to that four tens pro forma number and how that compares to the 1.2 as reported number.","The actual assumptions that go into your spread sheet about sort of the relative rates of NES versus us, we\u2019ve characterize broadly in the past as being double digits the difference, so that\u2019s the starting point. Obviously with United Rentals being the premium and that gives you a sense of overtime how much of gap there is to bridge.","How much that the gap we actually bridge and how quickly we actually bridge it, time will tell but that\u2019s the feel that you are playing on sort of double digits kind of number that we are working to make sense for our customer base as you go forward.","Seth Weber","Okay. That's helpful Bill, thanks. And then there has been a lot of discussion around the industry about mix, right and big industrial contracts and what not can you talk about the competitive rate environment specifically going after these larger, bigger and longer term industrial contracts what that looks like today?","Matthew Flannery","Sure Seth, this is Matt, I mean it's depending on what markets you are in and what customer you are going after and the volume, these are always competitive. The good news is they don\u2019t go out for bid regularly and we have been incumbent in many of these and that's gives us a lot of credibility. So we are comfortable with our positioning, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should never take any of it for granted, and this business will always have somebody wanting it and that's part of being leader in the industry.","There is always someone that wants what you have that's something new for us, it\u2019s something that we very comfortable with and I wouldn\u2019t call it out any more or less competitive in whether this is a national account sector or whether you are fighting to get more share in an MSA. So we feel comfortable with the level of competitiveness, we're encouraged by the level of responsibility from an absorption and rate improvement that we see in the industry as well.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, the only thing I would add to that is the harness is on us to make sure a value proposition is such that we meet or exceed our customer expectations and that's why when you talk about our specialty, you talk about the capital that we\u2019re spending, you talk about the digital and things that we're doing for total control, finding ways to assist our customer to be more of a partner and finding ways to drive productivity and safety. That's what we need to do and that's what we need to keep focused on and we're very good at that and our team is really focused on it.","Seth Weber","Okay, all right. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","Hi good morning everyone. I wondered if you folks can talked about how you are thinking about adding capital into the oil and gas impacted regions obviously big swings in the town and how is your risk appetite and capital deployment in those areas, can you just as we are clearly ramping up short-term here.","William Plummer","So Jerry, much of our growth has really come from absorption. As we had talked about in the past and probably the biggest example of it is our pump business. We made the decision a couple of years ago to hold on to some assets that we knew had a lot of life left in it. We mothball them, and we we're really getting the benefit of that decision today, when you see the type of growth that we're getting in that pump business. And those are types of decisions we made overall.","We didn't expect to run 80% time use in the oil and gas markets. So when anymore accurate terms, so if we were willing to leave our footprint there, these feet enough to keep some capacity there, it gave us the opportunity to respond for this growth. And I think that's where we are today. We aren't having to dump a lot of fleet in there to drive that growth. And it feels good a little bit self congratulations here admittedly, but it feels good to have put in that faith and commitments and to be able to benefit from it.","Michael Kneeland","So that said, we learned lesson last time right and so we want to be mindful of how much of the business that oil and gas upstream activity represents and make sure that we're making a more balanced decision and more conscious decision this time around then last time it was just hey it's go, let's go. Nobody says that out loud but that was sort of the mindset. This time around we're saying okay, let's make sure that when we're putting fleet in it make sense both for right here now and what it means for this longer term.","Jerry Revich","Okay, thank you. And on that note I'm wondering if you could just frame the CapEx growth that you folks are laying out here over the balance of the year. Can you just give us a regional flavor which regions are getting an outside share of fleet growth. In other words where you folks seeing the strong growth?","William Plummer","It's very broad. I know we say that a lot, but that's because it's factual. When you look at it where maybe it's been a little more gated to the coast, but because they have been so hot. But it is very dry, its across the board. The folks in western Canada are probably getting the least of it for obvious reasons, because they has some fleet absorb. But everybody else is running real strong utilizations and really improvement throughout P&L and have earned that growth. And that's how we look at it. But you have to earn the growth and then we allocate it. the team has done good job very broadly.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Nicholas Coppola","Good morning. So I wanted to follow-up on the NES integration. Now you are three months in, it sounds like it's going well and you are on-track your synergy targets. Has there been any surprises to the positive or negative, any color you would add surrounding the integration?","Michael Kneeland","Well I would say the positive is we had tendency to link towards speed when it comes integration it's our firm belief that you move that way and you get the benefit of it, I would say this is even faster than we expected. And that's what makes it difficult while Bill had to go through so many assumptions to give you NES standalone information, we view that as a very positive story operating as one company.","Another is the timing improvement, if you looked at the slide - you saw that the right panel of that slide, you saw that NES came in a little bit heavy on fleet a little bit lower time utilization. Part of our improvement is that we\u2019ve really ramped up that time utilization by absorbing that fleet quickly as a combined entity and it just go to approve that if you get everybody working together quickly, you can take advantage of all the capital that you have as a new combined team and that was probably even ahead of schedule of what we thought.","Nicholas Coppola","Yes, that\u2019s certainly a strong chart there and then I guess just another question, I wanted to ask about there is another slide about Project XL moving more to infrastructure and can you just may be add some detail around how you are moving forward with that goal or the new equipment types or mix shift that we should be expecting or is it really just more of a sales initiative of reaching out to new contractor types, may be just kind explain on that.","Matthew Flannery","Sure Nick, it really is a focus on that key customer segment that project type and making sure that we're well positioned to identify the opportunities and that we\u2019ve got the fleet to support those opportunities when we win them. So it's more of an adjusting new sales initiatives, but there is very much a focus that we're bringing to infrastructure projects now that we hadn\u2019t in the past.","You can see in that XL slide, the impact when you it compare to sort of overall aggregate infrastructure spending in the economy, we're out performing. So that\u2019s the good news and we want to make sure that we continue to drive that focus because it\u2019s a vertical where we think we line up very well with those kind of projects, those kind of customers. And don\u2019t believe we were getting our fair share in the infrastructure space previously and we're driving hard to address that.","Nicholas Coppola","Okay. Perfect, thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. As you guys step back and think about the market today, how would you characterize the supply demand balance within rental and where do you see that balance headed in the next few quarters as you think about the demand trends versus industry CapEx addition. I mean would you say that it is actually kind of tight today in some of these markets, where you are getting pricing or is it just more kind of your own initiatives or are we headed toward a position of kind of a tight market per say.","Matthew Flannery","Steve its Matt, there are certainly initiatives right and coming out of the first quarter just like we did last year it's your time to take advantages of what the market can give you as far as your focus on time and rate. So the demand has to be there, but with that being said, we feel that this is it's not just broad base for us, we expect the industry is doing a better job of being very rigorous on capital management and returns and I think that we're seeing that play through.","And there is no sign that we would expect that to diminish and everybody that we talk to whether it's OEM, whether its customers, everybody is feeling better about the industry demand and the industry behavior. I think that\u2019s the most fair way to categorize that.","Steven Fisher","Okay I guess a related question just thinking about the strong time utilization, really just trying to gauge how much structural change you have made in driving efficiency and fleet utilization. I\u2019m just curious how many points of time utilization do you think you have maybe added over the last year that are results of better processes and less OEC not available for rent you know that time utilization that may be sticky overtime.","William Plummer","Yes, I think it's great point and its one of the reasons why we felt good about the NES acquisition because that density of fleet in the market gives you the opportunity to drive higher time utilization and we do think we are enjoying that and when you think about where that midst of our fleet has come and you look at our year-over-year time utilization, we continue to mix in assets specifically in specialty that run usually lower time, in some instance significantly lower time, yet we keep climbing.","So, you have to look at it by category to truly break down the advantage, but we're pleased about the time utilization a trend that we've created on a year-over-year basis and how that comps to the industry. We feel strongly that's due to our density, allows us to do things that may be a regional or a local player can't do from time utilization prospect.","Michael Kneeland","But thanks for recognizing the fact that we are putting an effort and changing our processes, there is a chart on our investor deck on page eight that shows the NES during the time of acquisition where it is today, and speaks volumes about our team stepping up and making sure that we leverage our capabilities to drive better time.","The question we have to ask ourselves is, is there more for us to pull and we do believe that as Mat mentioned earlier, our team has earned it and we want to continue to make sure that we meet that demand, but there is lot of things that we're working on and as you pointed out our processes and lean management is paying some dividend.","Steven Fisher","Would that be as much as maybe a couple of points of utilization?","Michael Kneeland","It's hard to quantify exactly, because there are so many things that we were doing inside the organization.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Well thanks operator and I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. As always, we're available to continue the dialogue, we'll have more insights for you in 90 days, so in the meantime please feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, our Head of IR anytime. So I think this wraps it up for the day and we will see you at the end of the quarter. Have a great day.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning everyone and welcome. I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. I'm going to use some of the time today to share how we\u2019re thinking about the opportunities in 2016. But first let's start with the results that we reported last night.","As you saw from our press release, there is mix dynamics in the quarter as well as some strong positive. Our revenue was up just slightly year-over-year but we made the most of every dollar and delivered substantial profitability. In fact, it was a record quarter for us with adjusted EPS of $2.57 per diluted share. And an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. This is the Company record not only for the third quarter but for every quarter on our history.","In addition, our Trench Safety and Power & HVAC businesses' had stellar results. And our nine months free cash flow stands at robust $508 million. So there is a lot to like about the quarter and as you saw last night we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015.","But we also dealt with some ongoing challenges to our topline most notably upstream oil and gas and a weak Canadian economy with a negative impact on FX. In addition there is a still an oversupply of fleet in our industry and these three dynamics taken together have put pressure on rates and utilization.","This all unfolded pretty much as we expected and we\u2019re running the business with great cost discipline in this environment. And as the number show, we stay true to our strategy by taking a balanced approach in a competitive market environment. That's what our focus is today and that's what it will be as we can continue to be in 2016.","We\u2019ll issue our outlook in January as usual, but I think it's valuable to start that dialog now. So before Bill goes through the quarter, I like to give you some insights and for the current marking condition and our perspective on the coming year.","First, while our industry grew steadily through 2015, the demand for equipment rental in North America is far from hitting its peak. In the third quarter we once again increased our volume of equipment in our rent and while time utilization eased year-over-year, it was still a healthy 70%.","About half of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth in the quarter. Our Mid-Atlantic region was particularly strong with double digit growth. Activities in this regions anchored by large manufacturing plants under construction in South Carolina and Tennessee, as well as data center work in solar farms.","Industrial activity remains strong with year-over-year growth and an attractive pipeline project. Our utilization in industrial has been in the mid-70s for the past four to five weeks.","Now looking at our specialty businesses, our two largest lines, Trench Safety and Power & HVAC trench both had an exceptional quarter. Trench generated year-over-year revenue growth of more than 16% and Power & HVAC delivered 20% growth. These increases were primarily driven by same-store growth which is another indicator of demand.","All of our specialty businesses benefited from Greenfield expansion this year. To date in 2015, we have opened a total of 15 new specialty branches in trench, power, pump and tools and another three are in construction.","In our pump network, we are pursuing a penetration strategy with new and existing verticals. Many of our pump cold starts in 2016 will be co-located with the existing branches where customer relationships can leverage for cross-selling and if we have good success in developing a customer base for pump and verticals that deal with the exposure of upstream oil and gas. The business is now shifted to less than 50% of upstream and is growing in other areas.","Another positive indicator of demand is the performance of our national accounts which showed a year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter. And we have had good success in selling to high growth verticals to just chemical processing, power and multi-family residential construction. National and strategic accounts are driving some of this business but these verticals are also benefiting from a broader customer base.","So those are some of our observations in the quarter and we expect the remaining months of the year to play out with a typical seasonality.","Now looking forward, our industry is in a very good place. Forecasters such as Global Insight, Dodge and other see multiple years of up-cycle ahead. A number of factors are working in our favor. For example, a fair amount of U.S. construction growth is being driven by large multi-year projects with price tags of 50 million or higher and this is in an area where our scale really works to our advantage.","In the U.S., spending on plant maintenance project is ticking upwards which adds to industrial demand and industrial spend in Canada is forecasted to begin a modest but steady recovery starting in 2016.","This is all very positive but the disconnect between demand and revenue of course is supply. And as I mentioned earlier, we believe that our industry has continued to fleet up slightly ahead of demand in anticipation of a long cycle ahead. ","For our part, we can control which is quite a lot. We can adjust our CapEx, up or down in real time. We can manage our used equipment sales together with CapEx for optimal fleet size. We can adjust the timing of our spend and we can move ideal fleet to areas of higher demand.","In addition, we can continue to drive cross-sell and invest in our sales force. And we will be even more stringent on cost controls and take any number of other actions. We'll be making decisions against an industry backdrop that continues to look very positive.","We expect to benefit from the growth and demand for at least the next several years driven by construction and industrial activity and secular shift towards rental. And as far as withstanding any headwinds, we are looking at 2016 as a clean slate with every option on the table including the timing and the amount of capital spend.","We already know that we will spend significantly less CapEx in the first quarter of 2016 than in Q1 of this year. And we will be watching demand very closely and we will make sure we continue to meet our customer needs as the year unfolds.","In our opinion, the best way to grow the business is to go in the year with a strong understanding of the market but with no pre-conceive notions as operators. Our goal is and always has been to drive higher returns and we have a tremendous flexibility in the path we take to meet that goal.","So with that, I'll ask Bill to go over the financial results and then we'll take your questions. So over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks Mike, and good morning to everyone. As has been our custom, I\u2019ll try to add some color to the information that was released last night and to Mike's comments and also leave plenty of time for questions if we don't get to something that you\u2019re interested in.","So starting with rental revenue, within rental revenue - rental revenue grew overall 0.8% year-over-year. It\u2019s about $11 million of increase versus last year. Within that we had rerenting ancillary items this year essentially flat to last year. So no contribution to grow from rerenting ancillary combined or individually. ","It was all about OER growth and that was driven by the rental rate experience that we posted last night, rates being down at 0.10% of a percent year of year. That cost us about $1.5 million of year-over-year rental revenue.","Our volume growth was still solid 2.4% volume growth, that's growth in what we see on rent and that translates into about $29 million worth of year-over-year revenue increase.","Replacement CapEx inflation was about 1.7 percentage point headwind. Good for just under $20 million of year-over-year revenue decline as an offset to the volume increase.","And then everything else we are calling mixed and other was an increase of about 0.3% or about $3.1 million year-over-year and that includes the mix of our business as well as a little bit of FX.","Most of FX shows up in the volume measure in this way of breaking things down but a little bit drops down into that mix and other line. ","Speaking of FX, we continue to have headwinds from the Canadian currency being down materially. It was down about 17% in the quarter compared to last year and that was worth about $26 million of revenue decline year-over-year sprinkled amongst the other components that I already mentioned.","If you took out CapEx from the quarter, our rental revenue growth would have been 2.8% and certainly more in line with what we\u2019ve seen in terms of fleet growth and the other components.","So those are the comments that offer regarding rental revenue. Just to touch a little bit more on some of the operating measures, time utilization in the quarter finished at 70%, and as I said that reflected rental - fleet on rent growth of about 2.4% year-over-year. $6.27 billion was our average fleet on rent during the quarter.","That 70% utilization was down a 150 basis points versus last year comparable to the decline that we saw back in the second quarter, maybe a touch more.","That's clearly an area of focus for us as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year and certainly you'll hear us talk more about focusing on driving that utilization improvement wherever we can.","For used equipment, solid quarter for used equipment sales in the quarter, $142 million in the quarter. That\u2019s basically flat with third quarter of last year. And an adjusted growth margin of 44%. That's down about three percentage points from last year.","The primary driver of that decline is the mix of channels that we used. We sold about 52% of our used equipment in the retail channel and we did a little bit more in auctions than we have been doing historically and certainly more than we did last year in selling used equipment in the quarter. So, that combination was the primary driver for the margin decline year-over-year.","The auction increased, I wouldn't go too far with that. We used about 12% of our sales through auction in the quarter that compares to something like four or five last year and it\u2019s consistent with our focus on making sure that we dispose the fleet that we need to dispose of during the course of 2015.","Moving on the profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in the quarter and very importantly as Mike said 50.3% margin to be precise. That represents about $19 million of improvement over last year at a margin improvement of 100 basis points.","To break down that year-over-year increase of $19 million, we saw rental rates as a headwind in its contribution to EBITDA of about a $1 million. Volume, that volume revenue drove about $20 million worth of volume impacted EBITDA.","The full year inflation headwind there was 14 million against that and the margin decline that I called that earlier in used sales cost us about $4 million year-over-year.","The impact of our merit increases, we've been calling that out as about $6 million per quarter. It's again 6 million in this quarter and the two big positives in the quarter this year were the incentive compensation adjustment that we\u2019ve made in the third quarter this year as incentive programs have come down \u2013 our accrual incentive programs have come down reflecting the somewhat \u2013 while the weaker performance than what we had in our original plan.","So that was worth about $13 million of year-over-year improvement. We also had a mix and other improvement of about $11 million and that came from a variety of cost save items that Mike referred to.","In our cost of rentals, we had nice performance in delivery cost during the quarter. Some wage and benefit saves during the quarter and some puts and takes elsewhere that overall resulted in a very nice cost of rentals performance.","And on top of that, we also had a nice SG&A performance in the quarter with SG&A lines like TV expense, professional fees, little bit of improvement in bad debt expense of adding up to a nice contribution there.","So, all-in-all, it was a pretty good quarter on the cost front and when you add those two benefits of incentive cost decline and mix and other gets add up to the overall $19 million of EBITDA improvement that we saw versus third quarter last year.","Currency is sprinkled throughout those different lines of EBITDA bridge as well. Currency had an unfavorable impact of about $8 million when you\u2019re talking about EBITDA in the quarter. So, it continues to be a material headwind.","Flow through in the quarter, it's hard to even say some of these numbers sometimes but flow through in the quarter was very high. 317% for that quarter and obviously it\u2019s a very sensitive calculation driven by the fact that we had a fairly small denominator in the year-over-year change in total revenue.","So that 317% was heavily benefited by the incentive compensation accrual adjustments. If you take that out in the quarter, flow through would had been 86%. Still pretty robust and therefore reflecting some of the other cost saves that we had.","But as we said all along, you shouldn\u2019t look at flow through in a one quarter lens, you should think about it longer term. If you look at our year-to-date flow through, the total number including the incentive comp adjustments that we\u2019ve made is 84%, still pretty high.","If you take out the adjustment incentive comp, year-to-date flow through would be about 62% and that\u2019s very much in line with roughly 60% that we\u2019ve been guiding to. So good flow through story for the quarter.","Just real quickly on EPS. As Mike mentioned $2.57 adjusted EPS for the quarter was a company record. That\u2019s up 17% over EPS in the comparable quarter and that I\u2019ll remind you includes the effect of the currency headwind.","Currency cost us about $0.05 per share in this $2.57 EPS quarter. So, continue to deliver a nice result at EPS, even with the various impacts that we\u2019re talking about.","Moving on to free cash flow. Year-to-date we generated $511 million of free cash flow. Once you exclude the $3 million impact of merger related payments which is the way we talk about it. That compares to $328 million on the same basis in the first nine months of last year and we continue to feel very comfortable with our free cash flow view for the full year.","The primary drivers of the free cash flow result this quarter were the better EBITDA performance, a little bit less CapEx than the year-to-date period last year and a little bit better interest expense - cash interest expense in the year-to-date period as well.","Gross rental CapEx just to mention that for the third quarter was $409 million and that brings the full year-to-date period of CapEx spend to $1.4 billion. Actually the actual numbers was $1.425 ","Net rental CapEx for the third quarter was $268 million and that brought the full year-to-date net rental CapEx number to a $1 billion.","Moving on quickly to our capital structure and little bit on liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we had liquidity of just over $800 million. That included ABL capacity of about $620 million and a roughly $170 million of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel that we are well positioned with regard to liquidity.","A real quick update on the share repurchase program. We continue to execute purchases under the $750 million authorization. In the quarter, we bought back $167 million and that brings the total against this program at quarter end to $740 million, leaving $10 million to complete during the course of the fourth quarter.","We do believe we will finish that in the fourth quarter and as we\u2019ve said before the new billion dollar authorization that we have from the board, we will commence buying on right after we complete the existing 750 program.","Our thinking now is that the billion dollar program, we will execute on a fairly steady basis and as we called out before, we expect to complete that program over 18 months once we start it.","Last quarter I did remind you - mentioned to you all that we need to be mindful of limitations on the amount of share repurchases that we can do under our debt covenants. I will just update you there as we have said at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $500 million of available capacity for repurchasing shares or other restricted transactions.","That includes restricted payment baskets in our debt facilities, as well as the cash capacity that we have up at the holding company level of URI.","Just real briefly on ROI fees for the quarter, 8.9% in the third quarter. That's trailing 12 month number as you all know. And that\u2019s up 50 basis points compared to the same period of last year and flat with where we were at the second quarter of this year.","Not going to spend much time on the outlook because we didn't change anything in the outlook. So, certainly the numbers remain operative there. Certainly, if you have any questions about the outlook, we can address them in Q&A.","So, I\u2019ll stop there with my comments and again welcome any questions on the things that I didn\u2019t touch on or more detail on things that I did. But just want to echo the commentary that you heard from Michael and the results in the quarter we feel very good about.","Certainly the profitability, certainly the margin and we feel like we are on the right track in dealing with the environment that we are in and we certainly are thinking very much about how we finish out the year strong and have good momentum going into 2016.","So, with that, I\u2019ll ask the Operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.","Tim Robinson","Good morning, guys. This is Tim Robinson on the line for Ted. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, I was hoping you could help me understand how your replacement CapEx remains at 1.1 billion squared up with your largest supplier comments about lower replacement demand next year. I was just wondering if there is an opportunity for CapEx to be adjusted down in 2016 without actually impacting your strategic growth.","And secondly, I was hoping to get your thoughts on the pros and cons of aging your fleet next year as a strategy to maintain discipline on CapEx while supporting growth. Thanks","Matt Flannery","So, maybe I'll start and you guys can chime in. I won't offer any commentary on the OEMs view of what next year\u2019s order pattern will look like but the billion one of replacement CapEx for us is the calculation of what it would take in order to just replace the units that we would be selling as used and so it\u2019s a pretty straightforward mathematical calculation.","We make a separate decision every year about how much we will actually replace and that is driven by where the fleet stands versus what we calculate as its rental useful life, as well as how the used sales strategy fits in with our overall fleet management strategy. And those are the things that are going to drive how much we actually sell as used.","What that means to the OEMs, I'll let them comment on. The one thing I will point out that we do - obviously we feel the impact of prior year's purchasing patterns on any given year's rental use for life, and so we'll certainly be monitoring that dynamic as we go forward.","But again I'll let the OEMs commentary stand at their own commentary.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, I'll just add, this is Mike by the way. As I stated, we have no preconceived notions. We have an open thought on how we look at next year and the years beyond. I think what you pointed out is that there is flexibility, and we will exercise our flexibility as we go forward.","Right now we're in the midst of our budget process, it's a ground up and that process is underway and then we'll have that discussion with our Board and come forward in January.","But you laid out a scenario, various scenarios, but it really points out to the flexibility that we have.","Tim Robinson","Okay. Thanks guys. Best of luck next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Good morning guys. I guess, first the clarification. Is it possible to frame how much the incentive comp will help for the whole year this year and then does that become a headwind next year and if so, are you still targeting at 60% pull through margin next year, is that still the right way to think about it given the rate set up in the next year? That's just a clarification to start, thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Sure. So, the incentive comp impact $13 million in the third quarter, somebody's going to have to get me what we called out was $12 million in second quarter, and that's really where the adjustment started. So, year-to-date it's $25 million and as a modeling starting point there probably wouldn't be far off to say that we get something like the $13 million in the fourth quarter as well.","So, those are the impacts. The question is - your question about whether it reverses next year. It certainly will reverse out, at least we hope it will reverse out next year as we perform closer to what we ultimately plan for next year, it won't be a full reversal though because remember last year we accrued to a very high payout level for our program, almost maxed out.","This year we're accruing to a below target payout level. So, to normalize next year back is something like target which is how we would model and plan around next year. The snapback won't be quite as dramatic as the benefit year-over-year that we've seen so far this year.","So, I think those are the thoughts that I would offer. What's the another part of your question that I \u2013","Seth Weber","Just as a tack on to that clarification, is the 60% pull through margin given the rate dynamics and some of these puts and takes is 60% still the right pull through margin to think about for next year?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, that's the way we're thinking about it Seth, right here now. And certainly if there is a significant impact from the snapback of the incentive comp, we would call out what that impact was next year just as we did just now.","But as you think about the rest of the business, 60% we feel is a good way to think about pull through next year.","Seth Weber","Okay, thanks. And then just my real question is on - just trying to get my arms around the oil and gas discussion. Where do you think we are in that anniversaring that impact, I think last quarter you had talked about, you had repositioned something like $125 million of the $200 million of fleet, well I guess what's the update to that number.","And as I look at your dollar utilization numbers by product category, the trends in other - the comparable got less bad this quarter relative to the second quarter. So, I'm wondering are we past the worst of that as far as a negative headwind on dollar utilization and because the implication for your rate guide for the year suggests that rates are going to get step down here in the fourth quarter.","So, I'm just really trying to understand where we are in the spectrum on the oil and gas market? Thanks.","Matt Flannery","So, Seth, this is Matt. I'll take the oil and gas question. We've increased our movements as we forecasted. We have moved year-to-date $170 million out from that $124 million number that you had previously stated.","Other than seasonal items like [indiscernible] light towers, we feel that we're mostly done there. You could look at one of the charts in the investor deck and it'll show you on Slide 6, that we feel that the oil and gas demand is pretty much flat and bit bottomed out.","If it goes a little bit lower, it's not going to be by lot, we're not terribly positioned from a fleet perspective. So we feel we have that mostly capturing finish it up through the winter season.","As far as your other question was \u2013","Seth Weber","Well, so your dollar utilization for like the trench and other category got less negative in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. So, are we past the worst of the comps there? How do we reconcile that type of move with the pretty severe rate decline that's implied in your maintained guidance for the year?","Michael Kneeland","I'll take the dollar utilization and maybe Will or Matt, will take over the rate. As you try to build out your model, if you recall that we had a tremendous amount of cold starts in the specialty arena as a result of that you bring fleet in and as it goes forward, it's going to be putting it out, you'll see that should improve as we go forward.","I think that's the biggest delta around the trench and other. Again building it out and putting what we put in place, now monetizing that and putting the stuff out on rent.","Matt Flannery","Yes, struggling with how to respond to what that might mean for our rate expectation going forward. I think it's pretty clear that the fourth quarter year-over-year raise that we expect as implied by our guidance is down materially, materially more than it was in the third quarter. Honestly, Seth, I'm struggling with what more to say about that.","So, if you got more detailed question maybe you can take it offline and we'll see if we can address it better for you.","Seth Weber","Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Jordan from Jefferies. Your question please.","Justin Jordan","Hi, well done on the great quarter. Just kind of like following on some Seth just trying to get a handle on how we should be thinking about 2016? When we think about time utilization which was done 150 bps year-on-year in both Q2 and Q3, just to give us comfort on I guess returning back to year-on-year positive rate in 2016, and give us comfort on how you think 2016 will be a growth year for URI.","I'm just trying to understand, is that going to be you need to see time utilization at least being flat year-on-year before we're going to think about rate going positive year-on-year or what does the building blocks to getting rate moving positive again year-on-year, and moving to dollar utilization normalizing again as Seth was touching on.","Michael Kneeland","Hey Justin, maybe I'll start on this one as well. We start from thinking about what is the macro backdrop expected to look like in 2016, and all of the forecast that we see suggest that there is still going to be a solid macro backdrop.","So, that's a good starting point and it gives us the opportunity to continue to absorb whatever is left of the oil and gas dislocation, absorb any excess fleet that might have been built up in the early part of 2015. So, that starting point number one is that we think the backdrop will be positive.","Point number two is that we are very focused on the utilization performance of the Company as we think about next year. That's going to be a very important guide for us in thinking about what we're doing, where we're doing it, how much we're investing in the fleet to get it done.","So we will be I think in a better position to be able to manage rate if we're absorbing our existing fleet through utilization more effectively. So, that's going to be another, I think positive for us in how we approach delivering improved rate next year.","Obviously that will come along with a very intense cost focus, it won't directly impact rate but certainly will help us examine everything that we're doing and seeing as a way to be more effective inside the Company and therefore be more effective in the marketplace.","So, those are the key things that I point to, guys what did I miss?","Matt Flannery","I just would say that it's always - you're trying to say what is the back fall I think it's everyone's strategy, and for us it is about driving profitable growth and it's the balance between utilization and rate. And that's our strategy and that's what we're going to be focused on.","William Plummer","Yes, and one other thing that I'd try is just, if you look at where we expect to exit 2015, we talked last quarter about it being somewhere in that quarter to a third of a point of carryover, negative carryover next year. That's not a huge deficit to make up, it's one point that I would make in terms of getting rate back to breakeven or positive rate next year.","So, that gives us some encouragement that it's not an impossible game to get rate back to being positive next year and if we're doing the right things in managing our fleet and the rest of our business and the macros there with this that's a reasonable to think about next year.","Justin Jordan","Thank you. Just one quick follow on, obviously you've talked macro but can I just get a better sense on what you're doing on SG&A, you told on slide deck $22 million run rate of lean cost savings, which is impressive.","Can you just give us some color what else you're doing on the SG&A just to really help on the EBITDA margins, which are up 100 basis points year-on-year which is a very strong performance.","William Plummer","Yes sure, I did talk about focusing on T&E and professional fees. And getting some benefit there year-over-year, we'll continue to look for opportunities to maintain on that front. We're being very, very conscious about all the other lines within SG&A as well. We did have little bit of benefit in that debt expense, we'll continue to look for opportunities there and focusing on managing the age of our receivables which drives that measure.","So, we hope to continue to improve there, and then just general cost focus, it's ramped up in the Company over the last several months and I think that'll be the case going into 2016 as well. So, stay tuned and we'll call out more as we actually deliver.","Justin Jordan","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Bernan Jack","Good morning, this is Bernan Jack on behalf of Jerry. In your slide deck you disclosed branches with significant oil and gas exposure is having about 400 basis points lower utilization in your other locations. Do you expect that GAAP to narrow over the next few quarters, are you simply looking to reducing on equipment in those oil and gas regions?","William Plummer","So, we certainly expected to reduce whether that's the numerator or the denominator, rather it be that we put more fleet on rent, but we're going to react appropriately to the demand that's in the oil and gas, so if we can't move the numerator, we will pull more fleet out of there. It does look like it's bottomed out, the headwinds on a year-over-year comp will be there probably through the end of January or February, which is when we saw this year a lot of the rigs come off and then the fleets come off shortly thereafter.","So, we feel comfortable that we'll manage that GAAP even tighter this year.","Bernan Jack","Okay, thanks. And the second question, you've reduced CapEx guidance by about $100 million this year in response to about 250 basis point cut in rate guidance. Can you comment on what level pricing you would need to see for you to significantly cut CapEx further?","William Plummer","Yes, I don't know that we would think about it as \"X\" amount of rate yields \"Y\" amount of CapEx. I do think that we try to look at the overall position of the Company and the environment that we're in to make that decision around CapEx. I mentioned earlier for example that we're going to have a very bright light shining on our utilization of existing fleet in 2016, that's going to be an important driver alongside whatever rate we expect to yield.","So, I guess I wouldn't think about it as being that tightly linked to rate as long as we've got other opportunities to drive improvement in our business like with utilization.","Matt Flannery","No I think Bill said it well it's about what rate and utilization do we need to have profitable growth and that\u2019s going to be our north star that we will manage and some of the other metrics usually directionally supported, but it won't be as meiotic as a direct tie X rate brings Y capital growth.","Bernan Jack","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger","Thank you. Good morning guys. It sounds like you're progressing nicely on the oil patch absorption, but it sounds like the overall industry fleeting is going to linger in the next year. Could you give us a feel how long you expect that will persist? What you are seeing from the competition obviously a lot of questions about what you might do. Would just the environment there and what you are seeing others with regard to price and how they are handling fleets. Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","I\u2019ll talk about, we are seeing obviously we as well as others have tampered their capital spending and then I think most recently there was one of the OEMs yesterday said that their AWP they saw an increase in the smaller categories of rental companies.","It's not unusual if you think about it for a moment that the publically held company has always had access to capital. The larger companies followed suit and then you would see the capital that comes into play to a much smaller fragmented section.","Non unusual not alarming to me, but something we closely watch and we will adjust to our strategy and driving profitable growth. I think I made a very clear that you\u2019ll see a significant drop in capital spend in Q1 for us and as we come into January Scott, we will clearly will communicate our thoughts going forward.","But we watch it. We understand that the oil had disruption. We also understand and experienced the fleeting up within the industry and good thing is that there is multiple years of expansion left and we will have to play and we will make our calls.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks Mike. Just following up on that. This is the time of the year where you are negotiating with OEMs for the following year. Anything unique you're seeing this year. Are they very disciplined on pricing might we see some increased inflation coming to you next year? Is there any thoughts or commentary on this year may be different from past.","Michael Kneeland","So Scott we are in the middle of the negotiations with our strategic suppliers right now, but we certainly don't expect to see increases coming in the next year for a lot of reasons and will be very diligent about making sure that we are reacting and we are having our partners react to the current environment.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over. I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","George Tong ","Hi, thank you. Good morning. Switching over to the demand side of the equation, can you talk about how trends you are seeing in rental demand have evolved for you over the past quarter or so with the commercial, industrial, and infrastructure?","William Plummer","George, it's Bill. Ask that question again for me.","George Tong ","I was just trying to get a sense for how aside from the rental supply issues you have seen, how rental demand is evolving for you along your main verticals of commercial and industrial.","William Plummer","It continues to be a solid demand environment for us. I mean we are \u2013 you heard some of my comments right about some of the industrial demand that we are seeing in the drivers there. The commercial side of the house still has a got solid tone it and that is supported by whether use non-res construction or some of the other measures by economic data.","So the demand environment is still pretty solid. It's indicated to us both by what we are actually putting on rent, but also the commentary that we would get from our customer base. It's still very much supportive of growth in the next near term period and we expect that to continue to be the case end of 2016.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, the only thing I would add is the equipment we have is very universal applied to multiple verticals to give you some industrial manufacturing, automotive, some distribution, some fabricated metal product, heavy manufacturing, semiconductors and transportation systems, and chemical processing continue to show some areas of growth and expansion.","LNG we had some numerous projects as particularly in the beginning of the year and starts and LNG starts, but again all of the fleet that we have in general is universally applied to the verticals that we are talking about. So with the exception may be some of the pumps and we have talked about pumps in the past.","George Tong ","Got it. And Bill following up on your 60% EBITDA target flow through next year. What are the conditions loosely around re-growth and time utilization that you would need to see for you to be able to deliver on that.","William Plummer","Yes George, I think it\u2019s fair to say that any reasonable range of rate growth and time utilization that we we're thinking about gives us a real good shot at 60% so that's still very much within our thinking here about 2016.","Obviously if you don\u2019t get rate or time not as strong as you would like then it puts more emphasis on the cost level, but we feel like any reasonable combination that we're likely to see next year we can think about 60% of the flow through. So that\u2019s why we are communicating it.","George Tong","Thank you ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","Steven Fisher ","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up again on the oil and gas question. Matt, it sounds like you are saying that you're expecting activity to be pretty flattish next year. Can you just may be give us any color on what gives you that confidence because we are still hearing about some EMP CapEx cut through next year, want to gauge the risk of any further surprises there and then how would manage that.","Michael Kneeland","Sure thanks Steve. So, there has been some challenges that we have observed, but as you look - I referred to the Slide 6 before we see its pretty much bottomed out and actually may even be slightly above of a drop that would hit in July.","But when you think about if some more rigs comes down as there is further capital project cuts, I think that the fleet knows areas has moderated quite a bit, there will be a little less supply in those areas, but more importantly the dynamic for us is that we still own some business in oil and gas place right now throughout many of the different shelves there is a little some more direct business that may be going on so the dynamic of how the end users are being supplied is giving up an opportunity as well.","Matt Flannery","Yes. The only thing I would add to that is we don\u2019t expect oil to go up or increase over the next year or two. As I mentioned earlier on the pump business, we are expanding other verticals and we had some really good success. We take a look at in our investor deck on pumps specifically. We have expanding their verticals as we stand today. They are only down 9.6% on a year-over-year basis after having 50%of their business coming from oil.","So we would not tell we are going to vacate oil, but I think where we - oil for us in general has been drilling the holes and we saw that dropped significantly. We don\u2019t spend a lot of our rental equipment around existing facilities. Once they are established they are maintained. It's to minimus as far as rental capacity that we have there.","George Tong","That\u2019s helpful. And then Bill you talked about the $1 billion of share we purchased. Just wondering how you think about the balance between doing those repurchases versus your return on investment, I know on slide you are still showing a nice healthy 700 million plus of free cash flow next year. So, is the expectation that your cash flow will be sufficient to meet both the repo need, repo plan and any of your investment desires.","William Plummer","Absolutely. There are free cash flow numbers after our CapEx plan and that CapEx right now we guided you next year\u2019s CapEx $1.6 billion.","So we think that, that will be plenty of free cash flow to support the capital plans for next year and to execute the share we purchased on the pace that we talked about. So I am not concerned at all about being able to spend on share repurchases to that 18-month time frame and depending on how free cash flow plays out, we have excess cash flow beyond that speed of spin on share repurchases then we can make some more decisions about paying down debt while also during the share repurchase.","So we think we got a lot of flexibility in doing all of the above over the course of the next couple of years.","George Tong ","Great thank you a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nic Coppola from Thompson Research. Your question please.","Nic Coppola","Hi. Good morning. So used sales margins were down year-over-year and in your opening comments talked about the channel mix. Is there anything you can add about the used price environment and maybe what that might mean for the broader trend in the industry?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, used prices are still at very high levels. If you just take the proceeds 142 million divide into the original costs that we saw, which was 247 million, somebody help me out there. That\u2019s well north of 50% proceeds $0.50 on the dollar for equipments that\u2019s seven years old.","So that\u2019s an implication that the values are still very high. Have they perhaps ticked down from the absolute peak that they achieved a few months ago, maybe, but they are still at levels that represent very attractive opportunities to sell when you need to sell used.","So that dynamic is still very, very supportive of what we try to do as a company.","Matt Flannery","The other thing I would add is obviously companies are readjusting either age or either fleet mix particularly places that are heavily in the oil. And as we go through this quarter, in the first quarter - first quarter if you recall, the biggest auctions will typically take place in February were most of the companies spend a lot of time and effort to send their fleet.","I just want to remind everybody, not everyone in our industry has channel mix that we have. We do retail equipment and so unlike a lot of competitors, they don\u2019t have their capacity or lean on that capacity. That\u2019s a preference they have in our strategy.","So you're going to get mixed results, but as Bill mentioned our retail was pretty healthy.","Nic Coppola","And then may be just an update on lean initiatives since your $22 million or $100 million target, what's progress look like there and in your call you can add about operational improvements.","Michael Kneeland","Yes Nic. The $22 million run rate at the third quarter as I'm sure you have noted as down from where it was in the second quarter. And we should certainly talk about the drivers there but in terms of the initiatives that we are pursuing, they are very much similar to what we talked about in the past, right.","We have implemented all of important components of a lean program and what we are about now is rolling that out to a broader set of locations across our business and touching more of the processes in the business.","The $22 million number is reflective of all the work that we have done so far much of which was focused on improving the productivity of each dollar of cost that we spend rather than actually taking out absolute dollars of costs. Given that volume hasn\u2019t developed quite the way we thought it would this year, the improved productivity hasn\u2019t delivered the same amount of save that we initially thought.","And so now we are pivoting to look at whether there are actual dollar costs that we need to take out in order to continue to drive that productivity result and so that\u2019s being discussed as we speak right here now. We still are very comfortable guiding to that $100 million run rate impact by the end of next year, because we can look across the business and still see places where we haven't implemented fully all the lean initiatives or where we have, but we haven\u2019t gotten as much out of them as we might have anticipated.","So we are still comfortable saying that we expect to see the $100 million impact by the end of next year.","Nic Coppola","And that all make sense. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc.","Joe Box","So, I will ask you a couple of hypothetical questions here. One, if you guys don\u2019t see the equipment getting reabsorbed by the seasonally slow 1Q, does 2Q then become significantly lower CapEx quarter as well.","William Plummer","Joe, I think given the way we are thinking about managing our decisions around CapEx next year, if we don\u2019t see in the first quarter what we expect to see, I think it\u2019s highly likely that we will get aggressive around the second quarter capital spend as well. That's fair guys?","Michael Kneeland","Absorption is going to be big focus for us next year.","Joe Box","Okay, I can appreciate that. And then I guess what are you guys specifically looking for from your end markets. To maybe take a change in your capital allocation plans and ultimately put a greater percentage of free cash flow toward debt pay down.","Michael Kneeland","I think in my earlier comments I talked about the macros being an important backdrop for us. If we get a sense as the macro environment is not developing, such that our industry could reasonably expect in the mid-to-high single digits, your kind of growth next year then we are going to have to reassess, right, so that will be step one.","Step two, if we get early in the year and we are not seeing the absorption of the fleet that we talked about getting utilization up, then we are going to have reassess that's step two. And we'll continue to look at that.","Step three might be if we are not seeing the market offer a rate environment that we would expect. Early in the year rate is always a challenge because of the seasonality, but if it\u2019s more of a challenge than sort of what we have going into year, then we will have to reassess.","So those are the things that are going to be swirling around in our heads as we think about how we execute the CapEx and other components of our plan for 2016.","Joe Box","Thanks guys. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick one if I can. Bill, you already kind of talked about the cost of rental line in a number of different components there, but can you maybe just walk through some of the additional puts and takes like few incentive comp. Ultimately, we are still looking at some nice leverage here where we can see some margin expansion on the gross line.","Michael Kneeland","Yes. So there is an incentive component of the cost of rent benefit as well and certainly that was that play, but it wasn\u2019t the entire explanation for the cost of rent improvement that we saw. We did have a little bit of a fuel benefit in the quarter as well, that showed up - primarily in cost of rent and so call we call it a couple of million dollars in the quarter there as well.","But I\u2019ll remind that fuel as it plays through cost of rent is a pass through for the vessel fuel. The fuel that\u2019s actually in the equipment we rent, right, the customers pays for that. So it\u2019s sort of natural hedge.","And the fuel component of our delivery costs that\u2019s a pass through to our delivery charge as well. So it\u2019s sort of natural hedge. So the impact may not be as large as you think from fuel.","What else, I called out overall delivery cost of which fuel is apart. Wage and benefits saves were really just about headcount not particular headcount action, but the natural turnover headcount in our business, as well as some efficiencies that we are realizing from some of the costs saves initiatives that we talked about earlier.","Those are the primary drivers within the cost of rent saves and we think we have got the opportunity to continue to drive more saves as we go forward.","Joe Box","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland.","Michael Kneeland","Well, thanks operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. As we stated earlier, that was a very exciting quarter for us and we've also updated our investor materials. Make sure you go to our website and download both our financial deck and the background information. If you have any additional question or would like to go any of our facilities, you can reach out to Fred Bradman anytime with your questions in our Stanford office.","With that Operator, we will end the call.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Mike Kneeland","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As you know, we often start these calls by talking about profitable growth. And today we have another strong quarter to discuss. We have measured our performance in concrete ways including our ability to get attractive margins and returns.","In the third quarter, we achieved both of these objectives with results that were solidly rooted in a sustainable advantages such as fleet management, vertical strategies and productive gains as well as an effective strategy for M&A.","Our acquisition of NES and Neff are still young but they are already returning good value for our shareholders. And then, Baker integration is going well as you will hear later in the call.","Underpinning these initiatives is a robust endurable cycle that continues to propel industry growth. And it is important to note that we are outperforming both the U.S. equipment rental industry and the construction marketplace both of which are estimated to be growing in the mid single digits.","By comparison, our pro forma rental revenue in the quarter increased by almost 11%. Let me mark this morning will be followed by Matt, who will talk about our operating landscape and by Jessica who took the reins as our CFO last week.","Now turning to the third quarter results. Both total revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased significantly in the quarter. And our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 20 basis points to 50%. Now, if we exclude the impact of Baker, we are up 80 basis points to 50.6% which would have been the highest margin in any quarter in our history.","Looking at the underlying drivers, we had 7.4% increase in pro forma volume of equipment rental year-over-year and a healthy 2.1% increase in rental rates with gains across all 15 regions for both the quarter as a whole for each month individually. And we are growing our rate sequentially every month since March and the key point is that we have been able to convert these higher rates into stronger improvements in margin.","The third quarter metric time utilization was 70.9% in the quarter, this was essentially unchanged from a year ago on a pro forma basis even though we had a spike in last September from the Hurricanes. So overall, remaining time utilization in the core business in a very high level.","And as you saw in our press release, our underlying metrics did their job in driving returns and they point to consistently strong customer demand. Given these positive dynamics, we raised our guidance yesterday for full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CapEx. Our new outlook is based solely on our belief that we will outperform our earlier expectations of revenue and adjusted EBITDA.","As for BlueLine, Jessica will give you the expected impact separately in her remarks. So operationally, we are well positioned to manage that growth. We built a powerful engine for organic expansion and for simulating future M&A. The discipline is that we even still through technology, process improvements and our safety culture have kept our priorities right in center while smoothing the way for acquired operations.","In the third quarter, even with the integration underway, our team turned into excellent safety record. Our recordable rate in September was 0.74 and our rate for the year remains well below 1. So I applaud all of the employees for that.","So in summary, all indications point to a solid fourth quarter with continued momentum. If anything, our avenues for growth have expanded given the recent investments we have made in our Gen Rents and Specialty segments. But not only larger, we are also more diverse in terms of the solutions that we will offer that makes us valuable partner to construction and industrial customers.","At the same time, we maintain a robust capital structure and we are on track to generate significant free cash flow this year. These are all company specific strengthens largely independent of the macro environment. We will be talking more about our growth initiatives at our 2018 Investor Day that we will host in New York on December 11 and I hope you will join us there.","For now, I will end my comments where I began. With the promise that we are flexing every muscle in our operation to drive attractive margins and returns. We are executing nicely on that goal and we want to keep raising the bar on the metrics because while we are gratified by producing strong results, will never be a 100% satisfied with them. Though, [all we] [ph] more that we can do and that's a good thing for our shareholders.","So now I would like Matt to add his thoughts on the operations and Jessica will cover the numbers. So over to you Matt.","Matt Flannery","Thanks Mike.","A minute ago, you heard Mike speak about our focus on driving returns and I want to use my remarks provide some specifics about how we achieve that particularly in terms of adding value for our customers.","We feel strongly that we our broad offering of fleet, services and technology differentiate the United Rentals customer experience. And as you know, our specialty segment is a cornerstone of that offering. So let's start with that.","Our acquisition of Baker adds new capabilities for fluid solutions while the segments robust organic performance in the quarter outpace the company as a whole. And things are going well with Baker and the combination is on track. The North American operations have been fully integrated and we plan to do Europe next year. We retained Baker's key leaders and the entire team has proven to be a great fit. They are excited about our initiatives from branch collaboration and they are sharing customers with our Gen Rent locations and we are actively engaged in the market for our new offerings of tanks and filtration systems. And looking at the specialty segment as a whole, we continue to gain critical mass. The Baker added 56 branches to the segment and we also opened an additional 26 cold starts this year. So together this brings our specialty footprint to 319 locations in North America with another 11 in Europe.","And in the third quarter, specialty rental revenue increased over 39% year-over-year including almost 18% organic growth. And these numbers include a significant contribution from cross selling which grew nearly 25% year-to-date. Our investments in the specialty aligned well with our company wide commitment to drive returns in our core business while adding valuable services for our customers that's what the team is focused on maintaining our strong customer relationships through a comprehensive offering of products and services while keeping a keen eye focused on profitable growth. This goes far beyond our scale and service offerings.","For example, we are growing our United academy curriculum which now stands at 435 training courses and we are continuing to develop our customer facing technology. This includes our digital capabilities including our proprietary total control software. And last month, we held our annual total control conference in Dallas for more than 250 customers who use that software. The agenda focused on digital solutions that help our customers drive productivity, safety and efficiency at their work sites. And the customers also got to hear about our technology strategy and we received a lot of great feedback from them. This was our 19th conference and our biggest one yet.","The customers in attendance represented more than $400 million in annual rental revenue for us and it's a great example of how our technology is a differentiator. Earlier Mike spoke about company wide specific strengthens and how they exist independently as a macro, while these levers become even more valuable in the demand environment like the one we have today. Virtually every external sign post us positive for construction including the ABI and the Dodge Momentum Index construction employment data, project backlogs, our used equipment pricing and among other indicators, the industrial indicators are in the same camp. The various purchasing manager report such as the ISM and the Chicago PMIs are above 50 which indicates expansion.","I'd also like to share some of the data points that underscore the broad-based nature of the cycle from our vantage point. In the third quarter all of our regions increased rental revenue year-over-year. The bulk of that revenue came from our key verticals within the construction and industrial sectors. In fact almost every vertical that we measure was positive for us year-over-year.","For example, infrastructure is a vertical that's been giving us a nice steady trend up for a while now. In the third quarter, we saw sustained demand from infrastructure projects throughout multiple regions in both the U.S. and Canada.","Project diversity is another hallmark of demand. On the West Coast, the tech giants are building data centers and we have four major airports that have work underway including a $14 billion project at LAX. And in the Gulf, there are continued opportunities across the entire petrochem complex from upstream oil and gas to midstream pipelines to downstream refining and chemical processing. And in Canada, our rental revenue growth stayed positive up almost 10% over the prior year. There are some big projects on the horizon in Canada as well including a massive $40 billion liquefied natural gas plant in British Columbia. We've been supplying the pre-work at that project for a while, once it ramps up, we expect to be onsite until about 2023.","So that's a snapshot of our markets, healthy and growing. And if you ask our customers they'll tell you that things look good and our branches feel the same way. We're confident about the fourth quarter and believe the cycle has plenty of gas left in the tank. And next up for us is the BlueLine integration. And we're looking forward to welcoming the BlueLine team and moving into 2019 with a larger platform and even more capacity for Europe.","Now I will ask Jessica to go over the numbers and then we'll take your questions. Jess?","Jessica Graziano","Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be joining the call as our CFO especially with such a solid quarter to discuss.","One quick note before we get started. The numbers I'll be reviewing are as reported except for a few instances where I'll call them out as pro forma; the pro forma numbers include our two most recent acquisition Neff and Baker as if we own them a year ago.","Let's begin with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the third quarter was $1.86 billion which is up 21.2% or $325 million year-over-year. If we break that down further, O-UR grew 20.3% which is an increase of $269 million that growth came mostly from higher volume which was up 17.8% or $235 million, rental rates contributed 2.1% or about $28 million.","The impact from inflation on our replacement CapEx was a headwind. Call it 1.5% or $20 million. That leaves the impact of mix and other which was a benefit of 1.9% or $25 million. The positive change in mix is mainly due to the growth of our specialty business. Also included in rental revenue were re-rents and ancillary both higher this quarter as well benefiting from increased volume and the addition of Neff and Baker.","Re-rent contributed about $9 million in the quarter and ancillary was better by $47 million. The majority of which is from higher delivery revenue coming in large part from recovering increased fuel prices. Now those numbers were as reported. But as Mike noted on a pro forma basis rental revenue for the quarter was a robust performance up about 11%.","On to used sales which were essentially flat year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin on used sales was 50% that's down from 56.8% that's primarily due to the impact of selling the older fully depreciated NES fleet last year. What's important to note is the used sales market continues to be very strong. Our sales as a percentage of OEC was 58.2% and that's up 500 basis points. The increase was due to a strong pricing environment up 6% year-over-year. To a lesser extent, we also benefited from the mix of equipment we sold.","Moving to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA of 1.06 billion was up $180 million or 20.5%. That came in at a healthy margin of 50% which was up 20 basis points and excluding the impact of Baker adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to a record 50.6%.","Let me walk you through the bridge on the changes in EBITDA, $158 million of the $180 million increase is from volume with OEC on rent up 17.8%, higher rental rates provided another $27 million while ancillary revenue was a benefit of $23 million. The impact from incentive comp was a benefit of approximately $10 million in the quarter.","So in total, $218 million of contributions to EBITDA is partially offset by four headwinds. We estimate that fleet inflation was a headwind of about $16 million. The impact from used sales was about $9 million and our [merit] [ph] impact in the quarter was $6 million. So that leaves a $7 million decrease in EBITDA from mix and other that $7 million is the impact of carrying fixed costs for Neff and Baker that were not there in the third quarter last year partially offset by the positive revenue mix I mentioned earlier.","I briefly mentioned EBITDA flow through for the quarter which was 51%. If we exclude the impacts from Baker and used sales to isolate our core rental business, our flow through for the quarter was 59%. So a good performance across the core businesses with operating costs coming in on trend and as expected.","As for adjusted EPS, a good result at $4.74 compared to $3.25 in the third quarter last year, while $0.87 of the increase was related to tax reform that still left us with a healthy $0.62 coming primarily from better operating performance and that equates to a 19% growth in underlying [Technical Difficulty]","Turning to CapEx. Rental CapEx in the quarter was $736 million up $164 million from last year. The increase was in response to the broad demand we're seeing as Matt mentioned. Our guidance for the year modestly increases the range on our growth CapEx spend to between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. Year-to-date growth CapEx was just over $1.96 billion. And I'll mention that we would be looking at lower Q4 CapEx considering the fleet we pulled forward into last year to support Hurricane Harvey and Irma.","Free cash flow continues to be a good story even with the higher CapEx spend I just mentioned. Year-to-date at September 30, free cash flow was $568 million or down $66 million from last year excluding the impact of payments we made for a merger and restructuring. The majority of the $66 million decrease mainly stemmed from higher CapEx as well as the timing on working capital needs. These impacts were offset in part by the improvements in our adjusted EBITDA.","Let's move to net debt and liquidity. Net debt at September 30 was $10.1 billion. That's an increase of about $2 billion since last September mainly due to the Neff and Baker acquisitions. Our total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $910 million made up of ABL capacity of about $836 million and cash of $65 million.","Now turning to ROIC. ROIC for the trailing 12 months ended September 30 was up 210 basis points to 10.7%. Since we're still using different tax rates within that trailing 12-month calculation I will mention that ROIC would have been 11% or up 70 basis points had we used the 21% federal tax rate in all periods of that calc. So as Mike mentioned we're very pleased with the increased returns we've generated in the quarter.","A quick update on our share repurchase program. Our new $1.25 billion program started in July, through September 30, we repurchased about $210 million worth of shares on that program and as we mentioned when we announced the BlueLine deal we expect to pause the repurchase program once the deal is closed while we get through the integration.","I'll touch on the impact of our 2018 acquisitions. Baker closed on July 31, so we had two months of contribution in the third quarter. Baker added approximately $56 million of revenue and $16 million of adjusted EBITDA both in line with what we expected in the quarter. We're on track as far as synergies with the run rate of about $14 million so far and a million of that is already realized.","As for BlueLine, we anticipate closing the deal this quarter, if we assume the transaction closes at the end of October, we expect that BlueLine will contribute in the neighborhood of $120 million of revenue and about $50 million of adjusted EBITDA to calendar 2018. We don't anticipate any significant CapEx spend for BlueLine before the end of the year.","I'll finish with a comment on guidance. And just to be clear this guidance does not include BlueLine for 2018. Our new guidance reflects our increased outlook for total revenue adjusted EBITDA and CapEx. That extra CapEx will help position us for what we believe will be a solid fourth quarter while kick-starting 2019 and still delivering robust free cash flow for the year of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion.","So quarter of excellent results in a favorable macro and strong positioning for 2019. And with that I'll stop and open it up for questions. So operator please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Great. Good morning guys. Thank you. Look I think the question on everybody's mind is used markets are extremely tight. You went through the numbers, your end markets sound like they're extremely robust. Why isn't pricing even better? And realizing that you don't guide on rate, I'm not looking for that but if you reading the tea leaves correctly on your end markets over the next 12 to 18 months like what sort of steady state rate environment you think we're in or are we in plus 1% to 2% or are we in flat, are we in declining? Thoughts on that would be great.","Matt Flannery","Sure, Ross. Thanks. So I'll take a couple of pieces of the question then Mike or Jess can add-on. But, when we think about rates, first of all, we don't -- we see this as a good rate environment. So positive sequentials throughout each month in the quarter is certainly extrapolated in our brain into positive rate environment. We guess that the pro forms or the year-over-the year -- on the year-over-year numbers whether pro forma as reported has some tough comps specifically in Q2 and Q3. So we see that that will moderate when we get into Q4.","For example, if you lay last year's sequential rate improvement over this year's actual achieved for the first three quarters which we've been challenged that in itself may even be conservative. But for modeling purposes think about that last year's achievement would bring us a 2.1% rate for Q4. That would bring us into 1% carry over into 2019 and what we think as you've heard will be a robust demand environment. So to answer the latter part of your question we certainly do think that this is a rate accretive opportunity not dilutive. So that answers that.","As far as the sequentials, no doubt August probably came in a little bit lighter than we thought. The reason we stopped giving guidance is because there are so many thousands of variables and inputs that go into this, that it changes. The good news is that's not an indicator of profitability, it's great directionally. If we had seen negative sequentials that would be a concern for us. But when we get to translate this rate experience into record EBITDA margin as Mike mentioned and high returns we feel very good about the end market.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks Matt. That's helpful. And then, Jess, you just broke out some numbers for your underlying incremental margin and the rental business was close to 60% x-used and x-M&A. What is your guidance embedding in Q4 on incrementals on the same basis?","Jessica Graziano","Hey, Ross. Its Jess. So implied in Q4, if you use the midpoint and I always caution on the midpoint, but if you use the midpoint, the implied Q4 flow through is something in the neighborhood of about 62% and that includes the drag from the Baker acquisition. Obviously, they're coming in with their fixed costs and a margin that was lower than the core business.","So if I exclude the impact of Baker in that flow through, the remaining flow through for the quarter ex-Baker is very high. So let me walk you through a couple of the impacts there. I'll remind you that we will anniversary the Neff acquisition in the fourth quarter. And so having done that we're going to have lower revenue growth quarter-over-quarter that's going to make flow through very sensitive to any changes in EBITDA. So for example, we've called out we have a benefit that will show up in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. That number has dropped a little bit, but we're still calling that somewhere in the neighborhood of about $9 million to $10 million of benefit from that reduced bonus. That has a significant impact on the flow through for the quarter. So to the impact of net synergies that are kicking in. That was obviously realized within the quarter. So a couple of drivers there that that still maintain ex-Baker a pretty high flow through for Q4.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thanks. And just any thoughts on equipment installation into next year, realize, it's -- you're going to be going into that. But you didn't seem too worried about it last call that changed at all. Are you still expecting like a fairly benign equipment inflation environment despite all the call pressures out there?","Mike Kneeland","We feel the same way that we did in Q2 call. We've got some great partners, good vendors and we feel good that we will continue working together. And we wouldn't model anything differently than we had last year.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your question please.","Rob Wertheimer","Good morning everyone. I assume your share price looks fairly attractive to you all. The question is a little bit as you integrate BlueLine it's a big deal, you don't want to get people nervous about how much that you carry et cetera. But do you have in mind like a threshold on that that EBITDA that you might feel like you stepped back in the market or maybe it's like a year and you're working on the integration and thinking about it or longer. Maybe just give us some sort of thoughts on how you trade those different opportunities off.","Mike Kneeland","It's a great position to be in as you pointed out. We do carry a lot of free cash flow. The way we framed it. We've said between 2.5 and 3.5 depending where you are in the cycle. We only finished out this year. You can do the math and see what we're going to finish out. And then, as we go into next year we're going to be very comfortably in that range. With regard to where the share prices -- the share price, we've been consistent not looking at that as we've applied our acquisition of the share repurchase program. It could have changed, it could, but right now I think it's going to be continue at a pace we've been doing. And if we change, we obviously will come out and tell you otherwise. But we don't look at that ups and downs as something that we need to have a knee jerk reaction to do something. But to your point, you have to stop think about it.","Rob Wertheimer","Thank you. And then you may not want to answer this question I understand but does the acquisition of BlueLine mean that you don't need to spend on growth CapEx in a healthy environment next year? Or should we assume that you can't operate the business as the business not on the acquisition?","Matt Flannery","Yes. I would think with everything you've heard us say about the demand environment, it would not be a good assumption to think that we're not going to put capital into the business. We feel very good about it. One of the reasons why we feel comfortable acquiring the company and even if you look at our pro forma not just our acquired growth this year, but our pro forma growth this year of 10.9% Q3 rent revenue I think that proves out where our focus is and how we think this larger footprint can only help us grow all about capacity Rob. The tech drivers, branch network and sales reps will bring onboard -- that give us more [indiscernible].","Jessica Graziano","And Rob just mentioned that -- as I know we talked about we're going to continue to be very disciplined in our approach to CapEx, right, so as we think about the planning process for 2019 and we decide where we think the year will go. As a management team we're talking constantly about whether or not that's the right level of CapEx for the business. And then, we are not afraid to flex up or down depending on what the business needs are.","Rob Wertheimer","So far looks good. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question please.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. First question is just on kind of the margin path you're on, on EBITDA and trying to think about as we head into next year some of the moving pieces around deal synergies that should contribute I think ancillary that's been high this year and a bit of a margin dilutive effect there. BlueLine that might be a bit of an offset, but it seems like it's a set up for continued margin expansion as you move into next year. But just want to kind of get a better handle on that given some of the moving pieces and the deals in particular.","Jessica Graziano","Hi, Joe. Yes. So we -- as you think about the flow through for next year. Yes, I think it's reasonable to think about the core business will perform at or kind of give or take a little better a little worse than where it is currently. We talked about a flow through of something in the neighborhood of 60% being reasonable for the core business. And that's not going to change. What will change is the impact that we'll feel from a full year of the Baker acquisition. And then, obviously, the impact that BlueLine will have on us in 2019 as well.","And so, well obviously, we're going to continue to drive benefit through both of those acquisitions. There will be a dilutive effect at least in the short-term on the flow through for next year coming largely from those two deals. Now that's going to be offset in part by the synergies that we've realized from them in 2019. But again, there may be a bit of a drag.","Joe O'Dea","Got you. Net-net you have kind of a general sense of whether you can also derive with rate and core incrementals?","Matt Flannery","Too early for us to tell. We haven't even get a chance to really look at the -- under the hood of BlueLine, but we do think that will be incremental returns. So which is what we're really focused on that profitable growth.","Joe O'Dea","And it looks like the BlueLine margin that you're anticipating in 4Q is a little bit better than what you saw on the trailing 12 months when you disclosed that. Is that all -- that's all BlueLine efforts, that's not anything that you would be anticipating on sort of aligning them in your rate structure?","Matt Flannery","No there's nothing in there for BlueLine. So unless I misunderstood the question.","Jessica Graziano","Joe, as far as the 120 and 50 that I gave earlier, no, that would be them coming in with about a 40% margin which is consistent with what we've seen for them.","Joe O'Dea","And then just one on kind of the CapEx timing where 2Q and 3Q a little heavier CapEx than what you might normally do, I think in response to just like the demand environment. But then, some concerns that -- was that a factor on the sequential rate over the quarter. Any kind of insight you can give into some of those variables you talked about with rate and some of what would have been a little bit of a headwind on the sequentials because of those other variables?","Matt Flannery","Sure. No, we don't connect it at all. I mean when you have a rate pressure because of too much demanded, the gap is in whether you get 10 bps, 20 bps, or even 30 bps is positive is that you go negative. So that's why we're not concerned about that. And when we look at the markets overall whether you look by product category or you look by geography we're still seeing in every one of the reasons that steady improvement throughout the quarter on a year-over-year basis which is really what we focus on as a rate indicator. There's just too much noise in the input to individual months of sequential. And you're absolutely right, the CapEx was there to supply demand and as we said we think that demand turned into -- to profitable growth.","Joe O'Dea","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Courtney Yakavonis","Thanks guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the comment on cross-selling growing 25%. Was that all from the acquisitions that you guys have done from NES and Neff or you starting to see some organic cross-selling from some of the digital efforts that you've made on total control and UR control?","Matt Flannery","So I would say it's a continuation of the efforts that we've been driving for years, right. So we'll just get deeper and deeper into the organization and then some pick up to your point on the broader customer base that didn't have access to those. But it's definitely a both not a either or. And we continue to be very positive about what we can do now with a bigger fluid solutions. We think there's some more cross-sell opportunity for that group that that we should be able to improve upon 2019.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just on your Gen Rent gross margins, I think they were up 120 bps year-over-year. Can you quantify how much of the benefit was just from lapping NES versus some of the items that we talked about last quarter freight and labor getting those some more in line?","Matt Flannery","I would say it's more getting our costs in line. We certainly do have a benefit as we sunset any of the acquisitions you just spoke about the flow through in Q4 when we sunset the Neff acquisition. But the real driver for the margin challenge in Q1 were those cost issues you pointed to and that we brought up and we've remedied those, feel very good about that.","Courtney Yakavonis","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Fisher from UBS. Your question please.","Stephen Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. Just getting back to a little bit of the why on some of the rate trends here because back in April on this call we were talking about 2.5% to 3% rate growth being reasonable for the year with potential for better. And now it seems like we're closer to 2%. I guess I'm really just wondering what changed if anything in the marketplace or how you were actually managing it. They just seems a little bit early in the cycle for rates to be decelerating given how robust it sounds like the opportunity set is on project activity.","Matt Flannery","Yes. As I said earlier, rates were about where we expected. We see 10 or 20 bps as negligible as long as you're getting the robust real life time utilization. The margins that you need and the profitability you need. And admittedly this year was a much smoother than last year and that's part of the competition you see. If you recall last year and I think we even have it in the deck yet we are having on Slide 37. We really dug a hole in Q1. And then, we had to aggressively backfill that hole and you saw really low numbers in Q1 and higher sequentials in 2 and 3. This year was a much smoother curve. If you actually -- ironically January through September of last year and January through September of this year on an actual improvement basis stand right on top of each other. So we still see this as a good rate environment and think '19 will be similar.","Stephen Fisher","Okay. And then, maybe just on CapEx, if you could just talk a little about what the specific metrics are that you're looking that they guide the decision to increase CapEx. There are some that would feel that the growing CapEx is inconsistent with a moderating rate growth environment. But I'm sure looking at it in a broader way. If you could just talk to some of the specific metrics that tell you okay, we can still grow CapEx even if rates are moderating.","Matt Flannery","Its margins and returns, right. So that part of the challenge and why we stopped trying to forecast the individual operational metrics of rate and time. Don't get me wrong. We manage rate aggressively. We managed time very well and they're both very important indicators. But when you think about whether it's our mix impact from renting more specialty fleets that in itself a $25 million positive in the quarter has more -- much more impact and about equal impact to the 2% year-over-year rate carryover. So there's other variables when we look at how we can translate our business into the type of performance that we have than just the rate.","So I guess the focus on it from an outward perspective I'll repeat we do not see that as a decelerating environment. We've generated as Mike said in his comments record EBITDA margin if you take out the impact of Baker and record returns even if you take out the impact of tax reform. So we really love the environment that we're in and think will continue to turn it into dollars for the company.","Stephen Fisher","Just a quick clarification on free cash flow. I think in the earlier this year you've talked about next year being potentially better than 2018. What do you think about that at this point?","Mike Kneeland","This is Mike. Obviously as Matt mentioned earlier, we're still going through, one, we haven't finished the year. Two, we're going through the budget process. But I think it's fair to say that will be better next year. That's a fair statement.","Stephen Fisher","Terrific. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","Good morning. Just a simple question. Just a level set expectations going into '19, the mix of your business, the customer size, long-term rentals versus short-term rentals. As you're going through the capital budgeting process, seeing the opportunities that contractors and customers are telling what they need for next year. Can you give us some insight on the mix of businesses to ration of rentals things that you're eyeing up already that can help us all level set how we think about the implications on time you rate and so forth just because few people are focused on rate new. At least help us some of those nuances that I could improve it, make it more difficult next year because mix obviously plays a big role.","Matt Flannery","Sure, Dave. This is Matt. So the customer profile continues to look similar, I think where there is some movement and I referred to it in the last answer is, as we continue to grow our percentage of specialty business not all that improvement in profitability that we get from specialty shows up in the rate metric I pointed to the $25 million a positive mix improvement in Q3 as an example.","But also in time, specialty products are actually diluted or time utilization and we've been offsetting that headwind for years and we'll continue to do so. But it is by far a great business decision because of the profitability that it brings with it.","As far as the striations of customers really we're getting growth and expect in 2019 broadly throughout our strategic accounts or national accounts and our local customers. And projects not too dissimilar from what we've seen. And when you think about our day, week, month mix very similar to what we've experienced. So not a lot of movement there. The biggest movement would be in the mix of our fleet dynamics.","David Raso","The growth of specialty above Gen Rent. What was the implications on rate not you on rate for the quarter. Just so again level set of specialties and we continue to be a focus to grow faster than Gen Rent that's a drag on this historical metrics that obviously the stock cares a great deal about. So if you can help us isolate a bit what mix is doing to those metrics. I think it behove all of us to understand what that specialty impact rates on for the third quarter.","Matt Flannery","So we've talk about the inputs that make it hard to forecast rate. It is exacerbated in specialty because you can price different service offerings in different ways whether it includes but doesn't include bulk and what kind how much is solution base versus asset base. It is actually really hard for us to predict. And we just respond to the customers need, price it appropriately, we don't really take that into account. Not that we don't pay attention to the rate and the year-over-year rate in specialty is positive as well and I wouldn't want to call that a drag. I just don't think all the value of a category is what I'm saying that it's not a drag overall in the year. It's not really a drag on rate, Baker will drag us a little bit. But that's okay, we'll get pro forma numbers and call that out. But I think overall, I wouldn't call it a huge variable as much as I would not fully appreciate the ancillary items and the mix positives that comes with specialty.","Mike Kneeland","David, the way I would -- Matt is exactly right. I think this is actually a great topic that we can have a discussion and point out at our Investor Day because we are changing the company. We've talked over the years. We're leveraging our customer and we're bringing that you know the specialty businesses into our customer base and we're growing it and the results are there and the returns are there to talk about. But I do think our Investor Day while we can spend some time on that subject.","David Raso","Yes. Let me look at the end of the day. We can talk about return on capital and cash flow we want, but you just beat numbers, raise guidance consensus probably going up and your stock down 10% I know there's some macro things going on obviously beyond your control, but appreciating how specialty -- and you're going to continue to focus on '19 to grow specialty more than Gen Rent. Understanding that I think it's pretty important to the story.","Lastly, the M&A landscape obviously touched on a little bit earlier about looking at your stock and where the leverage is exiting 18 especially in pro forma thinking about BlueLine. But you said it yourself 2.5 to 3.5 leveraged based on where we are in the cycle. How should we interpret your view of M&A going forward and where you think we are in the cycle?","Mike Kneeland","So the cycle -- we still think there is live store cycle number one, number two capital allocation is extremely important whether it be fleet or acquisitions. And clearly, we've seen acquisition has an opportunity and we will continue to focus on that. We have a very robust pipeline that we were reviewing will be very disciplined in our approach and nothing's going to change there, but clearly we still very much in that game.","David Raso","Maybe ask more directly, if we're going to end this year below 3. Would you be willing to go above 3 times leverage next year?","Mike Kneeland","For the right acquisition? Yes.","David Raso","Yes. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning. Good morning everybody. Sorry if I missed this, but just back on the specialty discussion maybe this is for Matt. Gross margins were down, I think 250 basis points this quarter. I think they were down a year-over-year, I think they're down 110 in the second quarter. Can you just give us some color on what's going on there, it seems like it's more than just Baker. And where do you see that kind of settling out.","Matt Flannery","Yes. So it is primarily Baker, so 170 bps to that is Baker. And then there's another 70 bps. I'm sorry. Do you have another point\u2026?","Seth Weber","170 of the 250.","Matt Flannery","Yes. And then you'll believe it or not was 70 bps to that change. And what that means is fuels more of a pastor. So you get the revenue, but you don't get to profitability on it. It's a smart thing to do for us to recover that but it does from a margin perspective put some tailwinds on that. So 240 of the 250 bps explained by Baker and fuel.","Seth Weber","Okay. So then, -- so next year called back half of next year you'd expect margins to be flat to up year-over-year then I'd assuming fuel and whatnot as kind of\u2026","Matt Flannery","We still have to work through the Baker issue, we just don't know yet. Yes, when that anniversary, yes, yes, toward the back half of next year absolutely. And then, there's no underlying issue with the margins of our specialty businesses. They're still growing well showing great margins and very profitable for us.","Seth Weber","Okay. And then, it looks like you bumped your branch count up to 36 for this year, I think it was 18 as of last quarter's presentation. Is that organic or is there just -- any color you could share there?","Matt Flannery","Yes. So the real change there was we added some spot going business in our existing footprint. So it is technically right branch accounts or businesses that you write contracts out of, but we're seeing a lot of real estate so not a lot of additional costs here, but we think additional opportunity to serve customers with a broader product. That was the change from 18, that we are talking about.","Seth Weber","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.","Stanley Elliott","Good morning guys. Thank you all for taking me in. Quick question, I think you may have spoken to it earlier, but in terms of resuming the share repurchase post BlueLine, how should we think about that timeframe into next year when you might look at resuming that?","Jessica Graziano","Hey, Stanley. It's Jess. So we're not sure exactly when that deal is going to close. And so what we will do is, we'll keep that program pause until we've had a chance to not only look under the hood of BlueLine but also assess our needs through the integration period. The plan is definitely to turn it back on once we've had a chance to do that. I can't pinpoint the time per se, but I wouldn't be surprised if you saw trying to get back on as early as some time in the first quarter of next year.","Stanley Elliott","Was there a kind of a window period where you were looking to complete it or was it -- if he could refresh my memory?","Jessica Graziano","So -- before the pause we had talked about finishing it by the end of calendar 2019.","Stanley Elliott","And then, lastly you talked about the cycle and the breadth of the growth that you're seeing in the momentum there. This is more like a just out of curiosity, but with more national account customers more larger customer more specialty more being intertwined with all these suspects, do you like the visibility into your business has improved with these changes? Just more curious than anything.","Matt Flannery","I would say overall we feel good about the visibility in our business. I would say some of the metrics in this call, right. So we're talking about a year. Let's be frank about it today. There is a way for us to maybe help everybody through how the impacts of all these acquisitions, different product offerings, different customer base broader customer base. I think we've got and will Mike or Jess maybe we can do this at Investor Day try to bring this all together and help everybody else see what it is that has changed and what should we be focused on. And then, therefore, you guys should be focused on. I think there's an opportunity there. But as far as for us what this really does is we think just makes us a bigger more important partner to the customers that we serve. By being a broader solution for that.","And that's as well as profitable growth which is why we do them.","Stanley Elliott","No. I totally agree. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning, guys. So can you give a little bit of color on the level of coding activity that you're seeing and maybe you can compare what you're seeing right now to the same time last year to get some perspective.","Jessica Graziano","So Chad, could you ask that again. I'm sorry. We didn\u2019t hear the question very clearly.","Chad Dillard","Yes. Can you give some color on the level of coding activity that you're seeing and perhaps you can compare what you're seeing right now to the same time last year?","Matt Flannery","Yeah. So I extrapolate coding activity to demand right not just the RFPs and the handful of quotes that are more formal than what we go out and do every day. We would say the activity is strong robust year-over-year perspective if you wanted to extrapolate our volume into activity. You'd have to say it's on a pro forma basis 10% higher, but we don't necessarily look at it from a quote over quote year-over-year. What has changed is where we're participating. So I would say we're getting more focused on certain verticals I mentioned infrastructure in my opening remarks but we're probably getting more than just product aligned geographic alignment but now vertical alignment and we're seeing opportunities to get further penetration in some verticals and we think that's what's helped driving our growth. I hope that's helpful. We just don't use that terminology of holding on a year-over-year basis.","Chad Dillard","Sure. That's definitely helpful. And then, also how big of an opportunity do you see with The Baker acquisition to reprise some contracts and have a similar question for BlueLine, and I don't know if it's too early to really trying to learn that.","Matt Flannery","It's certainly too early to ask on BlueLine. And as far as Baker, we see the opportunity here into broader solutions package solutions not necessarily individual pricing on a transactional basis. We see this as broadening a fluid solution sale as opposed to free bids and a buy type work.","Chad Dillard","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Steve Ramsey","Good morning. It's Steve Ramsey on for Kathryn. I guess just thinking about Europe early days there I know but as you look ahead on Europe, do you think it will be more of a specialty focused region or do you see kind of over time there being a Gen Rent presence there. And then, just any learnings so far now that you've got it under your umbrella?","Mike Kneeland","Well, this is Mike. Obviously, it's relatively to the Baker acquisition it was relatively a small piece. We're very much in the learning stage. It would be premature to say anything else above and beyond that as far as how we would think about it. We do see the opportunity for Baker in Europe to continue to grow at very nice returns and that's where our main focus will be. But clearly, it's -- we're probably looking at sometime in the first quarter towards the mid to tailwind the first quarter, at least the first half of the year beginning to fully integrated with our operating system. So again, it's too early to tell, but we're still focused really in North America, still the biggest market for us.","Matt Flannery","I would just add Steven that we are encouraged by the level of talent we did acquire there and how we can leverage that to learn faster than we would have without is probably the opportunity.","Jessica Graziano","Excellent. And then, thinking about specialty cold starts for next year. Obviously a bigger amount this year than what we thought going in. Thus bringing in BlueLine change the need to have cold starts and instead you just add on the capabilities for specialty to the BlueLine real estate.","Matt Flannery","We'll make that decision. We haven't really decided on it regardless of where house it and how we resource it from the real estate perspective. We are planning on about another 25 cold starts next year in specialty and it going to bring out a great opportunity that we've utilized in past integrations. Sometimes we get to use some of the real estate that we get from an acquisition because they have extra capacity and sometimes we just have to go out and find real estate, but we don't think either way real estate will be an inhibitor force.","Steve Ramsey","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning. In specialty real strong growth in same-store sales double digits. How sustainable is that. And then could you speak to the volume versus price mix in there what you have seen what you would expect to see going forward and how you think about managing that?","Matt Flannery","So as far as we continue to see more growth opportunity in specialty. We haven't filled out the footprints actually of any individual one fully. So there's wide space for every one of them, some are a little further developed, Trench has been our longest standing specialty business. So their networks a little more fully developed but still had some wide space and others. Baker being the most recent example have a ton of wide space. So with a specialty, we'll continue to be in growth mode for a while now.","As far as pricing versus top-line revenue, they're pricing on a year-over-year basis is very similar to what the overall company's price is.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Following up on that how implemented is total control across fluid solutions. Obviously with Baker entering is that something you are going to be aggressively pursuing and how much of a differentiator can that be? Thanks.","Matt Flannery","So some of our customers that were already doing business with Baker were and were on total control for us have a very high expectation for us to do that quickly and we're in the business of meeting those expectations. So it absolutely needs to be integrated because the customers are counting on. As far as will be a further advantage to the value prop for the existing Baker customers that weren't doing business with us. We believe so.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi, good morning. Your ancillary revenue really accelerated this quarter. Can you just flesh that out a bit. Are you folks getting more success in pushing through transportation inflation than the past couple of quarters or is that a strict pass through and can you comment on the contribution from the specialty business in terms of contributing to that ancillary revenue performance this quarter and the sustainability of that.","Jessica Graziano","Hi, Jerry. You are right on point. The increase that we saw in the ancillary, the biggest component of that is the delivery revenue that's grown as a result of our being able to recover the fuel increases that I think everyone is seeing across the business and across the industry. So that is by far the biggest part of ancillary. As far as the breakdown of the specialty in that number, it's pretty much the same for the specialty businesses that would be for Gen Rent, our being able to recover that delivery, is pretty consistent. I wouldn't call out anything special for specialty and ancillary. I would just note again that the majority of positive mix that we had for the quarter was definitely coming from the specialty business.","Jerry Revich","And Jess, just a clarification. Were you more successful in obtaining the recoveries this quarter than in the past couple of quarters? In other words did the percentage of accounts that are willing to pay that increased for you folks?","Mike Kneeland","It's a very tangible thing to sell. All of our customers are dealing with the same issue in freight increases, fuel increases. So I would say we lagged a little bit in Q1 took a little time to catch up and then we talked about that on a Q1 call. And then we did a better job of recovering in Q2 and Q3.","Jerry Revich","And my follow-up on utilization Matt, you spoke about the storm comps, can you just talk about how that continues into October, so you folks had delivered fleet the third quarter which impacted utilization, I think a bit. So now that CapEx is slowing, should we expect utilization to be better than normal seasonality over the next couple of months? Give us some context, how you are thinking about it?","Matt Flannery","Yes, sure. So when we look at our pro forma which is how we always look at these metrics whether it's rate or time we were 0.4 positive in July, 0.2 in August and then you saw 0.7 negative in September. That's when we had the huge ramp up last year because due to Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser degree a little bit on Irma. We take that at about 50 bps of those 70 bps. We think that will continue in October just because of the comp issue. And then, it will start to moderate throughout November and be gone by the end of the fourth quarter. So as we go through Q4, we think that that comp compare issue will erode and will be back to par let's say by the end of the quarter.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.","Mike Kneeland","So, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Our third quarter investor deck is online and available to download along with our deck describing the BlueLine acquisition. Hopefully, we will see you all at our Investor Day in December. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to connect with Ted Grace, our Head of IR, if you have any additional questions. So operator you can end the call now and look forward to our next meeting. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"21133":["United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) Q2 2016 Earnings Call July 21, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Michael J.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

My. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor especially in the United States and I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth in demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then, we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.","So, I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%. And, it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.","Now, looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good, but a little softer than we expected. And, we drove a 3% increase in volume, and which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.","I want to spend a few minutes on rates, because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4%, but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range.","It's always difficult to forecast rate. So, it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5-point or better in both May and in June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria, and we've had some success in turning that around. Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May.","Now, I remind you of something I've said many times. Rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice-versa. There's always a give-and-take between the metrics. And we also said recently that we felt we could do better on rates, and in the second quarter, we did.","Now, turning to our operating conditions, from what we see in here, the cycle is intact. We made that statement on our last call and we believe it still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada, but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality, and that shows that we're still in up-cycle, with an added benefit with secular penetration.","Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East Coast and West Coast. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example, we're on two casino projects and a railcar facility. And work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These two states have increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now, and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer surveys show that optimism is still on the rise.","A number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which is at 52.6 in June, followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for five straight months and non-residential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private non-res, which is our largest end-market, was up 9.2% and contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work, and in some case is stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.","Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. And within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, pump solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our pump was up 21%. So, we're having good success at cross-selling our pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our gen rent customers and those who use our other specialty surfaces that we offer. In the first six months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.","Now of course, not everything is ideal, industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S dollar on exports. And the Rouse data that came out last week suggests that in the U.S. the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy dirt equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. Nevertheless, we would obviously like to see the industry return to equilibrium.","In our own business we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first six months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 for the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.","We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there is a sense of economic uncertainty. We're not seeing any backlash in our markets from macro, but if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it. The companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly and we've shown that we're very good at that.","In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business, and a broader vertical strategy that limits our reliance on any one end-market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling, companywide, was up 14%.","I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days, about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end, and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers. We're always looking at ways to walk-in our customers' shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transaction with us.","So, in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate representation of where we believe we are in the cycle, with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model, we fine tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales, and we'll continue to do that at every operating environment. And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year, and that's why you saw some minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community, and we believe our business is properly calibrated for the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing the growth in our end market demand.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill. And so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue, $1.204 billion of rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million, or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned-equipment revenue items, re-rent and ancillary, net essentially to zero on a year-over-year change basis. And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate \u2013 or revenue decline.","Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter, and then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other, and it's a net of a variety of different items. So, those are the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.","Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year, and the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%, that was down slightly versus last year and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year.","Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention, moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin and the key components were as follows. So, for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates that 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though, offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.","Fleet inflation cost is about $12 million and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have a usual merit increase impact, it was about $6 million of decline this year, and then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million, that included a little bit of negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment, but that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So, those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.","Moving to adjusted EPS, you saw $2.06 for the quarter, that was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. Our free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30, that's about $360 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx, lower spending and timing of CapEx spend, was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change, and the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.","Our rental growth CapEx, you saw that $722 million rental growth CapEx spend in the quarter, that was again consistent with guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year, it's down from a comparable period last year, and it does build a net flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points, and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we talked to so far.","Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure, we finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity that includes $1 billion of ABL capacity, that's available to us, and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. We had a lot of activity on the capital structure and, in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter. In May, we closed the redemption of our 7.375% and 8.25% notes, as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7.375% notes, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August that is when that will close.","If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So, some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions. We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter, so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021, and that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.","Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter, and that brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we started it late last year. So, we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we talked about recently, we're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.","Regarding the limitations on restricted payments, that are inherent in some of our debt. We are still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payments limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So, well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.","Couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year, you saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year, neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about, that was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling any non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator, the nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations, and when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that, we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year, we're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.","The two changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%, that's up from the down 3% to down 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization; we're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.","So, those are the key points of our outlook as they stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be how is July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there. On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it will bring us at around flat sequentially for the month, compared to June and time utilization is up, and in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So, it looks like it's up about 70 basis points, that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So, those are the key points on July, and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.","One last point, regarding guidance in future periods, we've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters, the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those two items in particular, those are a challenge to PEG, as individual elements of guidance, why? Because, we manage the company in a way that manages those two elements together.","So, in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we are going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance, starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then, starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those two elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls. We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think, gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business, and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.","So, those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess starting out, Bill, could you address \u2013 you had cited before that you may see some modest rate growth in 2017, obviously an incremental improvement in May and June here, and then you just gave us 2017 which seems on path. I guess I'm looking for what you're thinking about the flow through into 2017 now, and if you could speak to if your trends monthly for rate are flat or up or down to the end of the year, how you would think about that 2017 context, please?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Scott. I'll start and certainly, Mike and Matt, please chime in. So, if you look at the range of rate guidance that we gave, if we were to deliver flat monthly sequentials for July through October, and then a normal kind of seasonal decline in November, December, that would put us to the minus 2% high end of our rate guidance. If all of that happened, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance.","At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 0.6%, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happened, again with a normal November, December, we'd have a carryover going into 2017 of about negative 1.5%. So that gives you the two ends of the spectrum as to how we could finish out this year and what it means for next year. Hopefully, that's responsive. If not, ask another question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's great. Thanks for that. I'll just ask one more and then I'll turn it over. You cited internal initiatives and market environment as attributes to the improvement in rate in May and June. If you could elaborate on magnitude of each one, and then perhaps a little bit more on the internal initiatives? Thanks so much.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Scott. This is Matt. I would say the only reason we were able to achieve 90 bps of year-over-year time ut. and any sequential rate improvement, it all starts with demand. So we feel very good about the demand. So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those.","As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really, as we look at those two levers of rate and time, we came out of Q1 with a rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to the point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada; that was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies, and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Scott, this is Mike. The only thing I would add to that is, we're using data and the live data that we've got it to a point now where we can communicate that to management much more simplistically and in a user format that they can help manage their markets better than what we had before. So it's a combination of both.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. I'll pass it over.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question, please.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Joe.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. Could you just comment on some of the volatility we've seen in the sequential trends? I think toward the end of April when you last reported, April was trending worse than what you actually experienced for the full month, and then we saw improvements in May and June, now July to show a little bit flattish. So maybe just kind of what you've seen over the course of those four months in terms of kind of what jumpstarted some of the improvement? And then in July, why maybe we've seen that taper when typically in a stronger demand environment we would continue to see month-over-month gains?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Joe. This is Matt. I think you have to first start with how sequential is measured, right. So it's the current month feeding off of the previous month. So by definition that great May, June performance raised the baseline to what you're being judged on in July. So what you saw was just the new contracts going out, as you think about it this way, were not greater than what you achieved in the previous month or the last contract that just came off rent. So there's a lot of inputs, and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, and different products. So, I think to Bill's point about the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric.","But as we manage the business day-to-day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer. So I would say it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered in Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be. And now we're going to make those business decisions based upon profitability and customer demand going forward.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. The only thing I would add to that is if there is an opportunity, we're going to take it. We're not shy. We've got the tools. We've got the management team that's myopically focused on it. So if there is an opportunity for us to take more, we're going to definitely reach for it.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one more on with what we've seen at some of the Rouse supply-demand data recently, I think on the demand side, some of that's explained with heavy equipment trends and some weather effects. But when you think about it on the supply side, outside of your own decisions, is your general sense that the industry is behaving rationally with the supply growth that we continue to see. And then related to that, do you think that we have now fully moved beyond some of the equipment redeployment related to oil?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So there are several answers there. So in my estimation, I think we have moved beyond the oil and I think that has been fully absorbed. I think what we're seeing now out of the Rouse is net new acquisitions or net new fleet being added to the mix. It's not unusual because typically in the second quarter our industry has a tendency to fleet up that captures the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like and the good part of it is there's reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that; that's number one.","Number two, I think by order of magnitude when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things that I took away from the Rouse report, I believe, it was in May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand. The demand was higher. So that would tell me that their people are being good stewards in understanding of the industry trends. The question is does it continue? That's everyone's question.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thank you.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question, please.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","So kind of a follow-up to that last question. It sounds like folks are being good stewards and growing fleet at a lower pace, but what are you seeing in terms of the competitive environment in terms of price? So certainly your focus on price has been a significant driver of sequential improvement here. What are you seeing in terms of competitive pressure as well?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Nick. This is Matt. I mean, it's been competitive. It's been competitive for the past 18 months. And I would say that to Mike's point about the Rouse data, that supply continuing to moderate should help ease some of that competitiveness because the demand is there. So that's the great news, if demand is there. I think the challenge that we have to focus on is when you are the big guy on the block, you have the requirement to be the leader.","And we take that leadership position very seriously and there is always going to be in any given market somebody that wants what you have. That's nothing new. By the way that happened during the peak runs in the 2000s and it happened from 2010 to 2014, and we just need to make sure we keep a balanced approach to how we're going to defend the business we have as well as grow upon new end-markets and that's why you hear a lot of focus on our specialty business, on our value prop, and bundling all of our services and utilizing our footprint in a way that's unique advantage to us. So that's how we balance it, Nick, and that's how we'll continue to go on.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you just talk more about demand trends, particularly in Canada? What are you seeing there and are there potentially more fleet transfers that you can do? How are you working to mitigate any kind of weakness there?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So from a demand perspective, Canada is still very, very challenged. Now there's some provinces like if you look at the GTA, the Greater Toronto Area, we're actually up year-over-year. So there are some good spots, B.C. isn't bad in Western Canada. But if you can imagine the provinces that are resource reliant and commodity reliant markets, they're really hurting right now.","As far as fleet movement, I think that we'd pretty much move the fleet out of Canada, if we need to. As we sit here today, our Canadian business is down over 11%, but that's only 3.1% on fleet on rent volume. It's almost 8% on rate. So we think we've got the fleet right-sized in Canada, and I think most of our competitors have done the right thing as well and gotten their footprints and their head count and their fleet rationalized to the current market conditions.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mili Pothiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. So, I guess, could you just provide sort of an update on how you're thinking about the non-resi environment? Obviously, you seem fairly positive on the near-term, but I guess more generally, how you're thinking about the cycle here, especially given some of the data points we've seen on the macro front have been more choppy recently? And then just as a follow-up, I guess, can you jut parse out which verticals are stronger, which ones are weaker, any end markets that got incrementally better or worse during the quarter?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll try and take. This is Mike. I'll try and take a macro view, and then I'll let both Bill and Matt talk about and chime in as well as the verticals. But you're right, there's positive encouraging comments around construction, and there's also some negative and cautious variables out there. I mentioned the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index is another one, non-res starts, contractor backlog, the ISM, PMI, our own customer survey, these trend towards the positive. On the other side, we mentioned the Rouse non-res construction put in place that slowed a bit. The other part would be the construction employment numbers that came down. The question we have to ask ourselves is how much that was due to projects related in and around the oil and also possibly some weather related. (37:31) keeps on coming down here in the U.S.","So when we look at our backlogs and we talk to our customers, they are very optimistic in looking out over the next year of the projects they've got booked. And we're not going to go into details because I'm sure a lot of my competitors are on the phone too. But do I think that our overall construction will be tempered a little bit, yes. Do I think has it gone down to a point where we're not going to see growth, no. I think that the fundamentals are still there as we see it today. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. Matt and Bill can chime in or add more about the verticals.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll start by addressing the non-res, Mili. It is our biggest vertical and we still saw a nice growth in non-res in the second quarter. And we can make that statement about the first half of the year as well. And some of the indicators that Mike pointed to I think would argue that we should continue to see nice growth, maybe not quite as strong as what we saw sort of late last year, early this year in non-res, but still it should be nice, right, whether it's ABI, whether it's Dodge Momentum Index, some of the REIT starts data, backlogs that we've seen from various industry groups would support that non-res verticals should remain a solid base for us of growth.","And then when you look in some of the other verticals, we've seen growth in our downstream oil and gas vertical in the most recent quarters. That's encouraging to us. Upstream is still a challenge as you might imagine. But the refineries and some of the other related industries have been solid growth for us as well. Again, there's some timing items that flow through, but certainly that's a nice platform for us that we think will continue to be a growth engine go forward. And then there are host of other verticals where we can point to that do see growth going forward. Matt, I'll ask if you want to focus on any in particular. If not, I can continue to take off.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think we've covered it. I think, the largest opportunity is, what we've learned through our process of our go-to-market after some specific verticals and the success we had there, has really paid off. So it's not just where the end-market is, but where are the verticals that we can bundle our services, and support our customers, maybe deeper than we have in the past is something that we're really focused on and we're encouraged with the results.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. I guess just in the context of that could you provide any thoughts on how you're thinking about CapEx into 2017?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure, Mili. You saw in our investor material, we put a range out there between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion I guess was the top of the range that we put out. And I would say that we really do think about that full range as being available to us for 2017. As we go through our planning process starting up here in a couple months, we'll refine our view. But we are really going into 2017 saying look, our expectation is that the overall market will continue with attractive growth for us, and that will put us in a position so that we could spend anywhere in that range. The $1.2 billion that we're spending this year, I'll remind you, was heavily influenced by our desire to get our utilization up this year. We were down last year, we wanted to recapture that this year. And, I think we're making real good progress in doing that this year. If we do what we want this year, and if the market is still robust next year which we expect, then we'll be talking about, okay, what's the right number, and it will fall somewhere in that range. So, more to come, as we refine our thinking about next year.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Yup.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Seth.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. I actually wanted to touch on the 2017 CapEx point as well. Since you have kind of laid out this framework for us where if rates kind of are at that down 2% number for this year, you've talked about carryover into next year kind of flat from a rate environment. So Bill, trying to get a little bit more granular here, if you're looking at flat rates for next year, where does that put you in that $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion spectrum, is that enough to go the top end of that spectrum, and if you're down 3% this year, does that put you to the $1.2 billion? I'm trying to just pin you down a little bit more relative to this new data that you've given us.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate being pinned down. Look, we will have much more conversation about it, and answering a hypothetical is always a very dangerous game. What I would say is if we felt like we were carrying flat carryover into next year, and if we were confident in the demand supporting that or better, then I think we'd be more willing \u2013 certainly more willing to spend more than the $1.2 billion we're doing this year.","How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever said, $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, A, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent? That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now.","More realistically, I think, we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number. Again, but that would be dependent on us saying, yeah, we've got a rate environment that's okay, and we've got a demand environment that looks like it's going to sustain. And it's got to feel like it's going to sustain more than just calendar 2017, right. And so, those are the kinds of things that we'd be discussing; we'll be able to say more as we get into our Investor Day late this year.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Would you expect the mix still \u2013 the growth capital to still be skewed towards the specialty business in that scenario? Call it $1.5 billion, would you be \u2013 would the large majority of that growth continue to go towards specialty?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. If we were at $1.5 billion \u2013 again, dangerous game playing with hypotheticals, but I think specialty would still be a very significant portion of the growth capital in that kind of scenario. I'll remind you what we said before, right, this year, we don't have a lot of growth capital in our gen rent business after you include the effect of inflation.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, if we're spending more than the $1.2 billion, then some of that incremental spend would be going into the gen rent side of the business, but we'd also be supporting the growth in our specialty businesses in a robust way as well.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just to follow-up on the energy markets. Rig count seems to have stabilized here, commodity prices are stabilizing. Have you heard anything from your customers with respect to project activity restarting, incremental demand around kind of the current environment, or do you think that's still on the come?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Seth, this is Matt. I would say it's still too early for that. Everybody is reading the same rig data and the same reports, and I would say it's still too early for us to see it materialize into additional revenue, but it does give us comfort that we may have passed the trough, which is good news. And we were kind of planning on flat in the oil and gas markets for this year anyway. So we've moved the fleet appropriate. We think we have some existing capacity in there to absorb a little uptick, which would be great, but nothing that's making us think that we'd actually be moving more fleet into the oil and gas market at this point.","Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific. Thanks very much, guys.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Seth.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, George.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, thanks, good morning.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, George.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Bill, can you flesh out some of the factors that contributed to your lower time utilization guidance for the full year and how you see time ut. playing out during the remainder of the peak rental season?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, George. So, I mean, we touched on it before. It's partly the interplay between rate and time, and how we expect to be able to manage that go forward for the second half. We think the demand environment will be there to allow us to realize our goal for the year, which was nice year-over-year time ut. improvement. And we've got to make sure that we're approaching the market in a way that that allows us to do that, while also realizing as much rate as we can. So, I think that's really how to respond back, right, is that \u2013 it's the interplay between rate and time that we expect. We do expect to be able to continue to drive nice year-over-year improvement in time utilization. You saw 30 basis points in June, that's below where we want to be and need to be, and so we expect that we'll be delivering a little bit more year-over-year improvement as we go into the back half of the year. And we're going to be focused on doing that.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. And Mike, can you comment on how you expect OEC-on-rent to grow in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year, particularly as oil and gas comps begin to lap after 2Q?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think, there's a chart that we have out there, on our \u2013 it's on page six of our investor deck, that kind of shows the cadence of how our OEC-on-rent has progressed this year in comparison to other years. And you can see where it lift up last, as Bill mentioned, our July time utilization is up nicely. So, I think, the cadence you see there is going to be a similar pattern of delay in which it follows by the seasons.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, George, to the numbers, I think, you saw 3% OEC-on-rent growth in the second quarter. If I had to put some numbers to it, I'd say we might be just slightly under that in the third quarter, and around that number in the fourth quarter as sort of a way we're thinking about it. We need that kind of growth in order to get to the utilization improvement that we're looking for on the capital plan that we have, but I don't want to get overly precise with those numbers, because as we said that interplay between how we go at rate and time utilization which is OEC-on-rent in the numerator is something that we're going to manage actively as we go forward.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, George","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, David.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. I know we're working with a lot of midpoints here, but \u2013 and I can happily take you through all the math. It still seems that you're implying 2017 EBITDA to be down a little bit, when you capture all the aspects of your free cash flow guidance midpoint for next year, how you're viewing your net debt-to-EBITDA leverage. So, if I can just ask you straight out, is that what you're trying to imply with these numbers, or it just TBD, to be updated in October, and I'm \u2013 obviously I'm looking at slide 20 as you're \u2013 what kind of leverage do you expect in 2017, be it 2.6 times, 2.7 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Again, it's implying EBITDA down next year, I just wanted to ask you is that what you're trying to imply?","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, David, we give the range that we give to be explicit, the ranges on all of the guidance that we give, could lead you there. And I can't argue with the math that could come out, but I just, I think we do this every quarter, I'll just emphasize that the ranges are ranges for a reason.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Sure.","William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And don't anchor yourself too much to the midpoints of the ranges in guiding how you think about how we're going to do this year. Now that said, we are facing an environment where we expect rates to be down 2% to 3%, that's a significant headwind for a year to start out with, and utilization improvement is a great thing to try and offset that, but rate is pretty powerful as you know. So, that's a challenge that we are working to overcome. Will we overcome it or not, tune in later in the year and we'll see.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","And a question about the CapEx planning for next year, even within that CapEx, where you would allocate the capital, clearly specialty rental has been a focus. But, when you look at the dollar utilization year-over-year, you kind of see booms and lifts the dollar ut. has been \u2013 at least this past quarter was pretty negative, but trench and other has really been very negative. I mean, it's getting less negative, but it's been still pretty challenged, I mean, it was the worst for this quarter, it's been the worst year-over-year dollar ut. now for five quarters or so. How should we think about that? And maybe educate me, and when you say trench and other, how much is that capturing any of the specialty rental, I'm just surprised that dollar ut. has been that weak. It's actually been the weakest of your four major categories you provide us with the data?","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, David, this is Matt. That trench and other is a real broad bucket, you've got pumps in there, you've got light towers in there, you've got all kinds of stuff in there that's watering it down. So, I would not take that trench and other as a proxy for specialty in any way, shape or form. If it were just specialty, we'd still have the drag, that the pumps dealing with, right, obviously.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Sure.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","But, I would not \u2013 we'd probably change the label on that, maybe it won't be trench and other, maybe it will just be other, but that is not a proxy for our specialty product.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","All right. That's good to know. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David.","Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You kind of touched on this earlier, but I wondered if you would hazard a guess as to the shape of Canada over the next couple years. It's obviously very, very weak. You mentioned some sort of sequential strength. I mean, when do you think it will trough and is there enough fleet rationalization to get profits back without a sharp rebound, just maybe the shape of what you see?","Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Mike. As Matt mentioned, it's really a tale of two sides. There are some positives that are happening out of the East as opposed to the West and Western Canada, which was impacted by oil. But on top of that also the players that put things on delay. I will tell you that to restart the facilities there takes an enormous amount of work. It's not an easy feat. So and as you think that, that will be \u2013 the things have stabled out. So, I think over time, with the capital investment that the government has committed, we'll start to trickle in over time. My sense is that, could it be a year, that's anyone's guess. I know, I can't predict where oil will be, tried that didn't work, but my sense is that, it's probably more on the mends than it is on a decline.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Before we begin, I want to mention that our prepared remarks this morning will include some comments by Matt, and he'll talk about the field operations and give you a progress report on the NES integration. And then Bill will discuss the numbers before we go over to Q&A.","So here we are in 2017 and I'm pleased that we reported such a strong start to the year. In January, I described 2017 as a critical period in terms of both positioning ourselves with our broader customer base and driving new efficiencies in our operations, and we're executing well on both fronts.","Many of the actions we took in the quarter were designed to strengthen our earning power in future periods. This includes finalizing the NES transaction, which we closed as planned on April 3. Internally, I'm impressed how quickly our combined workforce has adopted the mindset of a single team, and customer reaction to the acquisition has been positive.","So I want to take this opportunity to publicly welcome more than a thousand new employees to United Rentals family. They are great addition to the team. We also got off to a solid start on Project XL in the quarter. Six of the eight work streams have now moved past the pilot stage, and we are pleased with the early progress. We have confidence in our EBITDA run rate target of $200 million by year-end of 2018.","At the same time, we are keeping our focus on immediate results. Demand is on the rise and we captured a lot of that business in the first quarter. Our revenue increased 4.4% year-over-year on a 7% increase in volume. That\u2019s the strongest quarterly increase on volume we've seen in a while. We are also efficient with our fleet. Time utilization came in at 66%, a record high for the first quarter and we generated a solid $490 million of free cash flow.","Rental rates remains under pressure, down 1.4% year-over-year due mainly to market dynamics. And while this was disappointing and a bit below our expectations, we're encouraged by the trends that continue to point to an industry-wide right-sizing of supply and demand. And this should continue to absorb excess fleet to the marketplace, which is positive for us.","Matt will talk about this in greater detail, but for a variety of reasons I want to emphasize that I am confident rates will head in the right direction as we work through our busy season. For our part, we plan to spend about $1.5 billion of CapEx this year and given the positive market trends and our commitment to growing our specialty offerings, we feel comfortable with that number and it should match up well against the demand.","As you know, we issued new guidance yesterday primarily to account for the combination with NES. It includes a nine-month EBITDA contribution of $135 million from the acquired operations. The increase in free cash flow reflects both the impact of the acquisition and our expectation for higher cash generation in the base business. In other words, excluding NES, we are reaffirming our standalone guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CapEx and increasing our guidance for free cash flow.","Well here some of the drivers behind our expected performance. Most forecasters are looking at solid growth in the U.S. of rental industry in 2017. Our customers and employees are very good about their prospects this year. Our customer optimism index in March was the highest we've seen since 2014. Demand is trending up in our core construction and industrial sectors, commercial construction remained strong. There is a nice inflection with upstream oil and gas with our macro is improving, and the worst of the drag from Canada appears to be behind us.","In addition, the vertical sales strategy we put in place is working. Infrastructure is a great example. Our revenue from infrastructure was up almost 5% in the quarter and a down sector. Our digital presence is growing as well. In the first quarter, we had a 15% sequential growth in online rental transactions and we gained over a 1,100 new customers in those three months alone.","And finally, our specialty segment, Trench, Power and Pump continuously outpace the company as a whole. These three operations combined were up almost 17% in the quarter versus the prior year. We opened three cold starts through March, bringing our specialty network to 217 total branches in North America, with the plan to open at least 17 branches this year.","Even with the steady expansion of our footprint, the bulk of our growth in specialty comes from same-store at higher margins in our gen rent operations. They make the strong case for continued investment in this segment. Specialty also benefits from cross-selling with our gen rent branches, specialty revenue and cross-selling to national accounts grew by almost 12% in the quarter, first quarter versus a year-ago and cross-selling our fleet started years ago as a way to boost returns on assets now has become one of our most valuable core competencies.","So in closing the year is off to a strong start. NES acquisition was finalized on schedule and integration is on track. We have numerous avenues for growth, with positive momentum across the board. Our branches and our customers are optimistic about the prospects and our confidence on the cycle remains intact.","So with that as a backdrop, I\u2019m going to ask Matt to update you on the operations and also on the NES integration. So over to you, Matt.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks Mike. I'm going to start with NES, because I know there's a lot of interest in the integration, and it's obviously early days, but things are moving along, consistent with our aggressive schedule. We believe that speed is a key to alleviate uncertainties for the team. We've already finalized the leadership decisions and incorporated the NES managers and branches and stores into our region district network.","And last only nine days after close, we converted every new location over to our Rental Management System, the acquired fleet and the customer histories are visible in the system and we're already seeing the team used this data share fleet and they're also passing along leads to meet market demand. This is very encouraging so early on.","And we're still going through a thoughtful evaluation of our combined footprint, some changes will be necessary. So we want to make sure we get it right, we're going to take some more time of that. And most importantly, we've made the team's top priority to focus on serving our customers and they're really coming through on that front. The next several months, we'll be unlocking the full potential of the combination. Since announcing our plan to acquire any effect January, we've been able to take a much deeper dive into their operations.","And I'm glad to report that the first quarter results performed largely as we expect, we continue to feel good about the cost synergies that we put out there in January. We believe that we're on track to deliver a run rate of about $40 million of incremental EBITDA in year two and the same goes for our revenue synergies, where we\u2019re still targeting $35 million by year three. And then the near-term, the combined company has an immediate benefit to our business. And as Mike mentioned, our new guidance reflects what we expect for the balance of this year.","Now, I want to look back at the first quarter to give you a quick tour of our operating landscape. There were a lot of commonalities across our regions fueled by demand in core projects. These include stadiums and resorts, data centers and factories as well as bridges and power plants. And the demand in the quarter was not only strong, but it was broad.","[ROIC] on rent trended up in over three quarters of the U.S. states and eight out of the 10 Canadian provinces. That's a sign of a healthy operating environment. Regionally, we continue to see the strongest growth along the eastern seaboard in the West Coast, as well as some of the South Central states. And another strong highlight was our Pump Solutions business, which grew rental revenue by more than 20% year-over-year and almost all of that growth with same-store reflecting our cross-selling efforts, our gains and market share and an underlying improvement in our end markets.","And we've been executing a diversification strategy for pump for the past two years, so it's nice to see that paying off. We\u2019ve always had big plans for pump. We never saw it strictly as an oil and gas acquisition. But as the upstream sector continues to recover, it's giving this business an extra bounce.","Now, I want to take a minute to discuss rates, which are obviously front and center to both our investors and our employees. While there are challenges in certain markets, on balance, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. First, as I mentioned, demand is strong and broad-based. You could see the momentum build across the first quarter in our monthly time utilization and as best we can tell our peers saw similar strength. We believe it's been a trend for the past six months or so and this dynamic has got that positive implication for rates going forward.","Another factor is seasonality. It's never easy to get rate in the first quarter. This is our seasonal trough in demand. That being said, we delivered a better sequential improvement in the first quarter of this year than last year. And if you look at the trajectory of our sequential and year-over-year rates across the quarter it's certainly suggests an ongoing absorption.","And finally, and let me be absolutely clear about this, our strategic focus on rate has not changed. I personally discussed the importance of rate integrity with our field leaders and they are keenly aware of how important this is to our business and our ability to serve our customers. All of these things taken together give me confidence that rates have the potential to get better in the back half of the year and that's the point I really want to emphasize this morning.","So we are getting to gain time for our field operations. We are entering our busiest period with a bigger talent pool, a more extensive branch network, a larger fleet and many new customers to serve. And our employees know the goal post and it's a point of pride for them to get us there. So if you have any questions about operations, I'll be happy to answer them during Q&A.","Right now, I'm going to hand it over to Bill for the financial review. Bill?","William Plummer","Thanks Matt, and good morning to everybody. I got a lot to go through, so I\u2019ll dive right in starting with rental revenue. The $49 million year-over-year change in rental revenue was up 4.4% and the components of that $49 million start with ancillary and re-rent revenue that combined was up $12 million and really that was driven by ancillary revenues associated with higher volume, delivery fees in particular, but also fuel recovery for rental. So strong quarter driven by high volume and you hear that throughout a number of the comments that will make volumes a huge part of the story in the quarter.","In owned equipment revenue, volume contributed $68 million over last year, but $14 million of that went the other way against rate and then replacement CapEx inflation took another $16 million versus last year. Mix and other was relatively flat in the quarter, only $1 million of headwind, so those are the pieces of the $49 million increase and that certainly suggests and ties to the notion that volume was a very strong contributor this quarter.","If you move to used equipment sales, $106 million of proceeds in the quarter that was down $9 million from last year and that reflects just the volume of used equipment sales that we did in the quarter is nothing more than volume. Actually if you look at pricing, pricing was a positive, pricing improved, and that led to an improvement in our adjusted gross margin.","The margin was up 2.2 percentage points compared to last year to 50.9% in the quarter continue to market and how we're able to sell equipment that in this case was almost 90 months old at something like 51% of the original cost of that equipment, so very robust used equipment market that we're selling into.","Moving to adjusted EBITDA $591 million of adjusted EBITDA $7 million improvement of last year at 43.6% margin. The components of that change $46 million of volume, but rental rates taking $13 million against that fleet inflation down $11 million, used equipment sales you can see the GP impact was $3 million of headwind versus last year. Our usual merit increase in that $5 million to $6 million ranges so call it $5 million in the quarter and then $7 million of mix and other and included within that $7 million was about $3 million from the year-over-year increase in our bonus accrual.","I call that out, because we've talked previously about the bonus accrual in the full-year of 2017 going up materially from last year it was $3 million of increase in the first quarter, those year-over-year impacts will increase in subsequent quarters because of the timing of when we adjusted our bonus accruals last year versus our expectation that we'll continue to accrue at 100% payout for this year.","So those are the pieces of the $7 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, the 43.6% margin was down a point from last year and really that reflects the impact of rental rates actually if you just adjusted out the rental rate impact in adjusted EBITDA you get back to flat with last year's margin.","On adjusted EPS, we had $1.63 results in the quarter that's up from $1.40 last year and it reflects the improvement in operating performance, but also lower interest expense from both a lower debt balance and some of the restructuring that we've done. It also reflected the impact of our tax expense going down as we adopted new guidance on how we treat stock-based compensation and it's now recognized in the tax line as opposed to direct adjustments to the balance sheet item.","So that stock-based compensation guidance benefited us by about $0.09 in the $1.63 quarter. EPS was also benefit in the quarter by the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases since last year about 5.6 million fewer shares this year compared to first quarter last year.","On free cash flow $490 million of free cash flow in the quarter, it's a very strong first quarter although down from last year. Last year was 137 million higher in the first quarter but that change primarily reflects the difference in net rental CapEx spend in this year compared to last year. Last year was a very, very restraint CapEx spend in the first quarter.","The cash flow impact brought our net debt balance at the end of the quarter down to $7 billion and that's $520 million less debt than we had last year, so pretty significant improvement in the absolute quantum of debt that we have outstanding as a Company. I do know that that $7 billion number had not yet included the impact of actually acquiring our NES if you add back the NES funding as we sit today we're at about $7.9 billion of net debt on yesterday's close.","Liquidity finished the quarter at $2.1 billion that included $1.7 billion of ABL capacity and little over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and again those are higher balances for our liquidity sources because it was in advance of the NES acquisition. If you look at it today, we sit at about $1.2 billion after the NES close.","Rental CapEx you saw the $219 million in the quarter that's up from a very depressed level of rental CapEx spend last year and the net rental CapEx change year-over-year just reflects the difference and that gross number plus the difference in net proceeds from used equipment sales.","Let me finish out \u2013 spend a little time on our guidance. As we noted in the press release and Michael's comments, we have updated the guidance to include the impact of NES. For the underlying URI performance, this guidance reflects no change in most of the metrics with the exception of free cash flow, which we have increased.","The changes for NES reflect \u2013 obviously owning the business for nine months and they do include the impact of synergies realized or expected to be realized in 2017, both the cost synergies and the net of any revenue dissynergies and synergies that we might realized.","So just to be clear the impacts that we added were $300 million in revenue and $135 million in adjusted EBITDA. We did put in an extra $50 million to cover gross rental CapEx for the remainder of the year at NES and those were the real changes to the exact guidance components.","On free cash flow, we added $150 million to our prior guidance that reflects the addition of NES plus some improvement in the cash tax position of the underlying United Rentals operation. So NES, if you just add the EBITDA of $135 million subtract $50 million cash flow for CapEx subtract $30 million from the incremental interest expense that we carry for the debt of acquiring NES and then add a $100 million of improvement in cash taxes, you get to that $150 million increase.","And within that $100 of cash tax improvement, about 50 of it came from the NES acquisition, either from applying the NOLs that we acquired with NES or from the deduction available for deal-related expenses that that in aggregate added about $50 million to cash tax benefit.","The other $50 million is from adjustments and estimates that we've made on the underlying United Rentals business as we've gotten a sharper view of what our cash tax picture will look like on the legacy business. So those are the pieces of the $100 million cash impact or cash tax impact that led us too partially to the increase in free cash flow guidance.","Just one last point on NES, we haven't changed any of our views, as we said before about the synergies that we went into, thinking about this deal with one exception. The NOLs that we acquired that we had announcement take that present value of about $150 million. We\u2019ve looked at that more closely as we've worked with the NES folks in tax and evaluated the positions that they've taken and that we can take going forward.","We now believe that those NOLs will have a higher present value than what we initially thought something like $150 million instead of the $125 million that we initially thought. So that's a little nugget that we found that that gives us more confidence about the value of the NES acquisition.","I think I\u2019ll stop there and will address either questions about these or anything else that you all are interested in hearing in Q&A. So I'll ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Thein from Citi Research. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","William Plummer","Hi, Tim.","Timothy Thein","Good morning. Just a first question maybe Matt, you could just put a little bit more color around your earlier comments in terms of your confidence in terms of rate improvement as you get into the second half of the year, presumably you're talking year-over-year, but maybe you could just flesh out kind of the dynamics between sequential versus year-over-year rate?","Matthew Flannery","Sure, so I think you might have seen it in the release last night, but you could see both from a year-over-year perspective and a sequential perspective, the negative tempered some as we went through the quarter and we find that encouraging when you combine that with the time utilization that we achieved and we believe that the industry is seeing a similar progression and it maybe not the same relevant number, but a similar progression all that points to the opportunity for us to be able to realize rate improvement in the back half of the year.","Now that improvement, first we have to start with sequential. We are not sure that the slow first start would allow us to get to positive rate on a year-over-year basis. But if you wanted the model what that would take and we're not forecasting, it would be a healthy half a point sequential improvement through our peak months of May through October. So that it would take to get flat.","We don't know if that's there or not, but I think the point we really wanted to get across is the demand is there, which is very, very strong and it's really about if this absorption continues and the industry continues to see the opportunity we are hopeful that will realize itself in the better rate performance than we had in Q1. Q1 was certainly a little softer than we had expected.","William Plummer","Let me just add one factual point, I don\u2019t think everybody has the progression of year-over-year, we didn't put in our investor deck, so January, year-over-year was minus 1.8, February was minus 1.5, March was minus 0.9, and so that progression along with the sequential progression I think is sort of evidence that we think the absorption will help move us in the right direction and supports the comments that Matt made.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Would you care to kind of extend this forward a couple weeks in terms of what you've seen thus far in April?","Michael Kneeland","As you know Tim, we've gotten out of the business of\u2026","Timothy Thein","Yes, okay.","Michael Kneeland","Talking prospectively about rates, so we'll beg off, thanks.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Understood. And just through more definitional, but will there be any meaning or should we expect any meaningful impact on URI rates as you fold the NES contracts or is that \u2013 is it kind of de minimis or what impact if any on URI rates will have as you fold that businesses?","William Plummer","Yes. We'll talk about that more when we got the data at the second quarter. I don't think it's any surprise to say that when we add NES rates, we will be adding rates that are below sort of the rate level that United Rentals has historically achieved. So that will have an impact of adding lower rates on that portion of the business, but the impact we believe will lessen, as we gradually manage rates in the way that we overall manage rates at United Rentals.","So we'll talk more about the impact there to the extent that we can't once we've got the actual data in front of us, but it will be at lower rates and then migrate those rates in the way that we normally would manage them from there.","Michael Kneeland","I think additionally Tim to Bill\u2019s comments is the opportunity to cross sell into that customer base, it can help defray some of the separation and just putting the tools, as Bill said in the hands of the employees to be able to have a broader offering to sell the customers would be very healthy.","Timothy Thein","Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. On rates geographically, the split between U.S. and Canada. Obviously, Canada has been a drag, if you can just give us that exact split and then within the U.S. or other territories where rate is already positive, we are just trying to figure out how much is this certain pockets are dragging the rate down or is it still very broad across the U.S.?","Matthew Flannery","Sure. Dave, this is Matt. For your first part of your question, if we had pulled Canada out, our 1.4 year-over-year rate decline would have been 1.0, so closer to normal, what we had expected in Q1. And as far as region, I won\u2019t guess specific regions, but we had a couple of regions that were positive year-over-year rate in Q1 and really not many of them were planned to be positive in Q1 because that's a seasonal trough.","The challenge came in some of the markets, there were a handful of markets that we're just drag this down and we \u2013 it's very \u2013 it's identifiable areas that we think seasonally we can help them improve if not we\u2019re going to move flight out of there into the markets that can support, the environment can support a better result.","David Raso","And when it comes to the cadence of standalone URI\u2019s CapEx, is there been any impact on trying to focus on rate on the timing of fleet going into the field.","Michael Kneeland","Not as of yet David, it's still early days to make that decision. Certainly, as Matt said, we're looking at where that CapEx goes once we spend it. But we haven't yet got to the point of saying we need to make a significant change in the timing of the CapEx. We're going to monitor that very closely. This month, next month are important month, so I would say stay tune and we can talk about in more detail in the second quarter.","David Raso","And then while you've sort of given the marching orders to focus on the right here a little bit with your branch managers and regional managers, has there been anything officially instituted on pushing rate differently than the constant tweaking that you always do on supply demand in every region?","William Plummer","Yes. There has been some strategies that we've employed, some that have been used in the past, some new and like always it's disseminating that information all the way down to the field network and I think we've done that effectively. I think that was frankly started mid-February which when we saw January come softer that's where you saw the trend start to turn.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, David. This is Mike. I would just tell you that we don't rest. We continually do learn through our analytics on ways in which we become better and how we manage, how we can communicate that throughout the organization. So it is still \u2013 we'll always be whatever always hoping and looking at ways to improve it.","David Raso","And I guess lastly, Canada rental revenues for the quarter appear to may have gotten back to flattish. The rate going forward in Canada, how would you frame currently down mathematically over 5% given the impact you implied for the whole Company. What kind of rate performance should we expect for rest of the year in Canada? I know we are not going to get back to flat for the full-year, but just trying to get a feel for Canada can get close to flat as the year goes on, maybe what the impact could be?","Matthew Flannery","Yes. Again, we've gotten out of the business of speculating too much about what rates could be, what I would say is that Canada \u2013 certainly we're encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in the eastern part of country, the flattening of what we've seen in the western part of the country, right, we believe it's trough. And so that will encourage improved rate performance in Canada. But when you're down over 5% in the first quarter, you've got some work to do in order to flatten later in the year. So I'd just suggested that we talk about as we go through the year.","David Raso","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Joe.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. Could you just talk about when you see transitions and demand historically, how you think about leading indicators and where we see the strength in the used equipment prices, we see the strength in utilization, clearly some surprise on rate, but how you think about the progression of those and a typical lag and whether rate would typically lag and how long that would be?","Michael Kneeland","Joe, this is Mike. I've always said that throughout my career that when you see these prices improve is step one and then as you look at utilization. And as Matt mentioned about the absorption of the fleet, we all so secret that when we went to the oil and the surrounding markets \u2013 surrounding our market that was a surplus of fleet, that is being absorbed. And then as the industry begins to achieve better performance on utilization, it's confidence towards rate.","Throughout my career I've seen that. Is there any given cadence. It's not a science, it's just something that happens that I have experienced and that's kind of what gives us some confidence based on the demand that we're seeing and how our employees who are straight on the field as well as our customers, the optimism they have for the remainder of this year into next.","Joe O'Dea","And then what is your sense for \u2013 maybe why we didn't see rate react more quickly? Is there just a general wait and see in terms of confidence and sustainability of some of the improved demand, it\u2019s promising to see that the rest of the industry also appears to be seeing a similar progression of improving utilization, but just why the industry would be a little bit apprehensive to run with that and set to flow through rates?","Michael Kneeland","Well, again it goes back to the absorption and time utilization, they start to see it, number one, if you take a look at where we are the sequential this year versus last year, albeit some a disappointing, it still improvement. The time utilization is one that gives us better confidence and as we talk to David, the rate impact in Canada 5.3%. Canada is on secret that as bought more commodities driven economy suffered during last year and started the level off and seeing time utilization improve there as well at the same time inflection of the rate I would say that there is opportunity as we go forward. Again it's building a confidence with inside the industry by utilizing the fleet that they have.","William Plummer","Joe, I think you hit on early on, when you said the rate is a leading indicator, it\u2019s not \u2013 the time utilization excuse me is a leading indicator. And I think that we're seeing, you just have to remember the seasonal drop that we spoke about. We have to go back all away to 2014, where we didn't have negative sequential rate in Q1 and even then they were fairly close to flat, when I remember looking at them last time. So it's part of it seasonal and we are really encouraged by the leading indicator that you pointed to a time utilization be enough or should help us ramp up.","Joe O'Dea","It\u2019s helpful, and then maybe just one more on kind of end markets and specifically, anything that you're seeing in Industrial and I think that tends to be more MRO related, but have you seen some an improvement in activity there and specifically in the industries or sectors that you would call out within Industrial?","Michael Kneeland","I think within Industrial, I think we're still at the point of looking at the timing of some of the downstream oil and gas, turnarounds that may have been postponed. So I wouldn't point to improvement there just yet, but in other Industrial segments. I think there are pockets that you can look at that it felt on a little better than they had in the past.","So we continue to see some aerospace related for example and they\u2019re probably some other pockets, but that we could call out there going to be important and try to be even talk in the same time, which is never a good thing. But for example, paper and forest products is \u2013 power is one that, but I'd like to pharmaceuticals, biotech we've actually had couple of industrial manufacturing oriented businesses that have done better. So a little bit of green shoots in some of the industrial areas, but it hasn't developed into a powerful way just yet.","William Plummer","Yes, when you look at the 7% growth obviously any offsets to some of the verticals and industrial that that might have depth and some one that might have call flat overall, really the non-res market pick it up strong and that really help drive that 7% volume growth.","Joe O'Dea","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks very much.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.","Robert Wertheimer","Yes, good morning. I wonder if you just go back to SG&A for a minute and you talked about some of the compensation increase SG&A where you've had it that high and past 1Q is relative to sales was a little higher than we thought. So wondering can you maybe clarify how much of the compensation bump was unique to 1Q versus evenly spread throughout the year and was there anything else in 1Q really that you would call on SG&A that may that higher than you might have thought?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, so what I get just a couple of pieces out. So the $16 million if I recall year-over-year increase. Within that I called out the $3 million bonus and in addition to that, there was 7 million of stock compensation expense increase separate apart from the bonus that the cash bonus that we pay out. And again that $7 million reflects the change in accounting guidance about how the stock compensation expense is treated. But it also reflects, primarily reflects the fact that our stock price went up tremendous amount in quarter and so that increase shows up as stock compensation expense in the quarter.","Now it comes out of adjusted EBITDA, it's wide and called out as a component of year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, but it was about $7 million of the $15 million, $16 million increase that we saw in the quarter. The other $4million, $5 million or so were really timing items among pro fees, T&E and some other in this and that, but those are the big jump.","Robert Wertheimer","Thank you. And then it does. But I'm sorry for not understanding, but does that stock compensation increase repeat across the quarters or is it more lumpy in 1Q due to timing of grants or exercises or accounting?","Michael Kneeland","It's more lumpy in 1Q just because of the timing of when our stock compensation awards are made and when they vest, you have to adjust for the stock price at that point, at the vesting point. So the bulk of that $7 million impact will be in the first quarter, been this and that as we go through the rest of the year just based on other awards that are granted, yes, that's going to be the biggest jump.","Robert Wertheimer","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Yes. Good morning. Thanks guys. I just want to ask about the Project XL and the $200 million of savings. Are you having to put costs into the business to generate those savings, we would look at that as a kind of a gross or net number?","William Plummer","So the $200 million run rate is going to be a net number. We do have to put some cost into the business in order to achieve some of the initiatives that we do, but when we talk about that run rate achievement, it's going to be the net. So for example, if we're focusing on another service line to our customers, customer equipment \u2013 servicing customer equipment is one example. You got to have service tax able to do the work. So that's an example of the expense that will come in, but the net impact is what we're tracking in that $200 million.","Ross Gilardi","When do you think we'll see it, I mean is it going to be like heavily kind of weighted towards the back half of 2018, is that more of like a run rate by the end of 2018 or should we \u2013 and where should we see, as you see our SG&A all the sudden start to go down of the fair amount?","William Plummer","So for the win I think, well, first to be exclusive the $200 million is the end of 2018 run rate, that's how we're stating the impact of the program overall, but you'll start to see impacts as we go through 2017, and it will be weighted a little bit more heavily in 2018 than it is in 2017, but you'll start to see some impacts later this year and those impacts should show in a variety of areas.","A number of the initiatives are revenue driven and so you would see the impact in topline, but we do have initiatives. For example, we've got a G&A focused initiatives that is pure cost that would show up in SG&A and have others that are mix of revenue and costs. So, I think it would be best \u2013 let us get more data out there and then we can talk a little bit more specifically about where to see the impact. And that will come later this year as we get the reporting package defined in the way that we feel confidence talking about externally.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. In the past you guys have expressed some confidence that you could still do like a 60%-ish type incremental margin in a flattish rate environment. Not to put words in your mouth, I wanted to just clarify that first. And do you still \u2013 if I have that right, you still sort of feel that way on the back of this quarter.","William Plummer","Yes, I think if we had a flat rate environment, I think we could be in the neighborhood of 60%, it requires us to be able to do some other things in the business that improved productivity. But I think we've be within hailing distance of 60% just with pure flat rate.","So still feel that there are opportunities in the business to do that especially you would have to have a business growing for example. Right, you can't say that when the business is declining. You would have to have some productivity focused initiatives, you can't just rest on your laurels and say 50% is going to fall in your lap, but flat rate gets us in the neighborhood.","Ross Gilardi","And just lastly, what are you assuming on the high-end and low-end of your EBITDA guide in terms of the NES cost synergies that you've outlined over the next several years for 2017?","William Plummer","So I think a reasonable range to think about for NES cost synergies realized this year is in that $10 million to $15 million range. So the range that we've given should encompass that kind of range on cost synergies.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","William Plummer","You bet.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Adrian Paz","Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. In regards to the NES synergies, can you provide a bit more detail on where the synergies will come from and also perhaps timing on how you expect those synergies to ramp?","William Plummer","So maybe I will start on the cost side and Matt if you want you can address the cross-sell. Yes, on the cost, it's good old fashion cost synergies, right, it's about G&A expense represented by wage and benefits and pro fees and T&E and all the basic things that you get at that are duplicative between NES and legacy United Rentals, so we will be addressing those as we go through the year.","There's also \u2013 the 40 million that we guided to fully developed run rate or fully developed synergies. There's also some branch consolidations that's included in there. And as Matt said in his comments, we want to be very mindful, and thoughtful about when and where and whether we have been branch consolidations, but we assume there would be some just because of the overlap of the network. So those are the main sources on the cost side. And on the revenue side, Matt if you want to offer anything?","Michael Kneeland","I would just say that in the revenue side, certainly you could see from more commentary that it\u2019s more back loaded. It will take more time to cross sell into the customers. The first step is to stabilize the customers, make those that have any overlap with us, feel comfortable that they don't need a second supplier and then after that we'll start selling our additional product offerings to the team. So that's why you'll see the revenue synergies be more back loaded.","Adrian Paz","And on timing, how do you expect those synergies to ramp in 2017 and also 2018?","Matthew Flannery","You mean, metric or you mean timing?","Adrian Paz","On timing, when you expect to see the synergies go through.","Matthew Flannery","So embedded in the updated guidance that we just gave including NES is how we see this will play out for this year. And then from there we probably will hold until we absorb a lot of the opportunities and challenges and give you more information maybe in the next quarter. The $195 million EBITDA that we gave out as the thesis for the deal still stands firm in our minds.","Adrian Paz","And in regards to rate, do you believe rate pressure is the largely reflecting the energy headwinds, or do you see them as maybe the industry adding fleet too quickly, any additional context on fleet dynamics would be helpful?","Matthew Flannery","Well, I actually think the industry has done a pretty good job on the absorption and not bringing the fleet to quickly. If that continues, that's why you'll hear on more positive tone on us about the forward look as opposed to what we experienced in Q1. So I'm not worried about that. And I mean we spoke about it. Demand is what we think is going to drive this thing. I don\u2019t know Bill if you have anything to add.","William Plummer","That\u2019s it.","Adrian Paz","Thank you.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Seth.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?","Michael Kneeland","Good.","Seth Weber","Sorry, going back to the confidence and the rates moving in the right direction, again? Do you anticipate any change in project type, more project versus MRO? Or any change in customer mix on national versus local that's helping you get more confidence in that or is it just really to appear I think demand is good, supply-demand balance is going to get better throughout the year?","Michael Kneeland","We may get some lift from it. We may even get some lift from product mix, which is a continued focus of ours as you see through our specialty growth. But I would say the big driver here is the basic blocking and it\u2019s not tackling of selling the full product offering in the demand gives us that opportunity. So demand will be a big one that will move that and we really feel good about that.","William Plummer","I would say its broad based.","Michael Kneeland","Yes.","Seth Weber","Okay, sorry, just going back to the cost side, the bonus accrual discussion. I mean is that \u2013 so I think a mobile, you called out $3 million in the first quarter. So I think that's going to get larger as we go through the year. I mean it sounds like you're going to get some benefit from Project XL and things like that. So I'm just trying to kind of net all these things together.","At the end of the day, does some of this XL benefit get wiped out by some of these other costs that are going to be accelerating in the model this year or just is there any way to kind of understand the slope of some of these costs that are coming in versus the savings that are going the other way?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, hard to guide you at precise level here is that on the bonus accrual I think the answer. I said that it will be expanding as we go forward. I think we said in the first quarter that the full-year impact if we finish this year at 100% payout over last year would be $27 billion if I remember correctly. And so we got three of that in the first quarter.","So I think if you started out just saying, okay the remaining $24 million will come equally over the next three quarters that will give you at least a starting point on that line. Stock compensation expense, we talked about that being heavily focused on first quarter, so you might just assume a smaller amount in subsequent quarters.","The timing items pro fees, T&E and some others, it's hard to figure out how to give you much guidance on what to do with those items as we go through the year because there will be some impacts on Project XL probably not huge, but some. And it certainly is something that's hard to figure out how to give you more guidance. All of that's embedded in our guidance overall, the total Company guidance that I understand your question is being more focused on the particular line of SG&A and maybe some other particular line.","Seth Weber","Yes, okay, we can follow-up on off-line. And then just one last one, now that the deal is closed, any thoughts about the share repurchases if you restart that or do you kind of need to get through more of this integration before you feel comfortable doing that?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, get through more of the integration will come back to as we get probably, I\u2019ve talked about this, so I'm living dangerously right now, but probably get through the second quarter and it's sort of in the third quarter when we can reengage the discussion. I think that will give us a good four months of seeing how the integrations going and making sure that it's played out the way we thought getting a better handle on how cash flows evolving this year and then we'll consider it and decide whether we want to do something where we want to wait a little longer.","Seth Weber","Okay, thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.","Matthew Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes. Good morning, guys.","Matthew Flannery","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase","So just one, I need to go back on rate because it sounds like that you\u2019ve been spending a lot of the Q&A on this. But I guess the one thing that I didn't hear you answer, it is just from a competitive perspective, what you guys are seeing on our peers or competitors behaving rationally or are you seeing some increased competitive pressure, which is adding to the rates decline?","Matthew Flannery","It depends on the market in the markets where we're seeing the demand being the strongest and our performance being stronger. We're seeing similar behavior by most of our competitors. And in the markets where it's a challenge and we're not able to get what we want, I\u2019d say it's exacerbated by the other folks that are living through that same reality.","So it's not really too different from what we've experienced in the past, the difference that we feel this year versus let's say last year is the demand is much stronger. This feels like a much different although numerically, you can look at sequentials and talk [yourself into] it similar, this feels much different coming out of this Q1, coming out of Q1 last year and I don't imagine that same dynamics not playing through for our competitors. I think it is. I think they probably feel much better coming out of Q1 this year as well.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Thanks, Matt. That's helpful. And then just nitpicky one, your tax rate was low this quarter and you talked about stock comp is the reason why. I know that the stock comp is a lumpy issue and SG&A for the first quarter. Is it also a lumpy issue in the tax rate and we should expect a bump up again in the second quarter and beyond?","Michael Kneeland","I think if you look at the full-year, we still think that we'll be somewhere in that 37%, 38% tax rate. So it will be more of an impact in the first quarter than it will over the remainder of the year.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Matthew Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Jordan from Jefferies. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Justin.","Justin Jordan","Good morning. Just one thing just going through the slide decks, on Slide 15 you change the basis of which you are showing your top 1000 accounts, the diversified account base slide. I'm just curious; it looks like key accounts are 71% of revenue. I'm just curious what you've done there and equally \u2013 I know we\u2019re [indiscernible] about regular time, but within what you're seeing in terms of the rate development is difference between rates that you're achieving on key accounts versus the unassigned accounts. I'm sort of implying a greater pressure within rate on key accounts?","Michael Kneeland","Yes. Justin, this is Mike. I am going to ask Ted to start \u2013 answer part of your question, and we are going to ask Matt, so Ted.","Ted Grace","Yes, just as it relates to the slide deck, the way we used to present it, it was actually measured a little differently it look at the sub accounts and so what we've done is actually aggregated on the sub accounts. So and actually now that the 10-K, I think the possibility of that nothing has changed except reporting it. I think as people want to interpret it before there was some confusion on whether just sort of what we in child accounts obviously more defuse in the parent accounts. Is that makes sense.","Justin Jordan","Yes, that\u2019s right. Thank you. And just on the rate pressure by key accounts versus other side?","William Plummer","It's more \u2013 you'll see variance by geography more than by account type. I think that\u2019s I have been pointing it to earlier. So when you look across the account type along the whole network, it's fairly similar by whether it's our national signed or we call territory accounts.","Justin Jordan","Got it. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thanks.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator. We look forward to speaking you again when we ramp up the second quarter. In the meantime, feel free to reach us to Ted Grace, Head of IR to ask any questions or feedback and as always, as you pointed out our Investor deck has been posted out on the Internet. So thank you very much and we can end the call. See you next second quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"21337":["United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Michael J.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning everyone and welcome. With me today are Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer and other members of our senior management team.","The financial results we reported last night were strong. They reflect an operating environment with a solid level of demand and integration with RSC that\u2019s very much on track and most important the successful execution of our strategy as reflected in our margins.","Now we will talk about all three of these things today, but also I want to give you some \u2013 our current thinking about the months ahead. But before I begin, I want to remind you that any year-over-year comparisons we give you are on a pro forma basis that is measured against combined results of United Rentals and RSC for 2011.","So just take a look at the quarter. It incorporated the most intense three months of our integration plan. From July to September, we completed the harmonization of most of our major account relationships, realigned our sales territories and closed 126 branches bringing the merger related closings to a 187 so far. We deliberately set the bar high to get most of the heavy lifting behind us by September 30th and I\u2019m very happy to say that we met that goal. And while we\u2019re managing all that change, we generated a solid 9% increase in rental revenue year-over-year and $570 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 47% margin. That\u2019s the highest margin, yeah. And in addition we\u2019re running ahead of plan and cost synergies.","We realized another $45 million of savings in the third quarter and we now expect to reach a $100 of realized cost synergies in 2012 for our ultimate goal of $230 million to $250 million on a run rate basis. Our cost \u2013 our progress on the cost side and a magnitude of our flow through sale bought up our internal discipline in the quarter.","Now turning to the external environment, let\u2019s look at the drivers of rental revenue. And they really reflect two things, a favorable market condition for the equipment rental and a successful execution of our strategy. The number one driver is rates. Our rates were very strong in the quarter, up 7.5% from last year and our volume of equipment on rent also improved 7.9%. As these numbers show, we saw a continued robust demand for our equipment that was also universal. All but one of our regions reported year-over-year increases in rental rates.","It\u2019s also significant that we were able to raise rates and what continues to be a modest and somewhat uneven construction recovery. But there are something more work here and we believe it\u2019s the rental penetration. The rental options continue to gain traction as an economically sound way to solve equipment needs and its adding an extra layer of demand.","I also want to talk about time utilization. It declined 200 basis points in the quarter compared to a robust level of utilization last year. So what were the impacts on time? For one thing we absorbed those 187 branch closings and we put more than a $1 billion of new fleet into the field. On a year-over-year basis, our time utilization was about 67% through September. And that\u2019s a healthy number and we feel very comfortable with it.","And so far for the fourth quarter utilization is running more than 72%. Our record margin makes it clear that were reflecting \u2013 managing rates, utilization, and costs. Nevertheless we want to be as accurate as possible about the numbers we put out there and that\u2019s why we\u2019re updating our full-year outlook.","We now expect time utilization to be approximately 67.5% for the year, which is a half a point below our prior outlook and we raised our outlook on rates to reflect a gain of approximately 7% year-over-year. We also think that will do better than expected on our free cash position. Our outlook is now free cash usage in the range of $25 million to $50 million excluding a merger related cost. And our guidance for total revenue, EBITDA and CapEx remains unchanged.","A minute ago I mentioned branch closings. We typically have a revenue dyssynergy when we close a location, title loss of business from small to mid sized customers and over time that revenue gets replaced. Now given a reduction in branches and headcount related to the merger, the impact in the third quarter could have been substantial. But our field organization did a great job of keeping our larger account relationships on even keel and this went a long way toward offsetting that impact.","You\u2019ve heard me say many times before that large customers are the foundation of our strategy and for the most part they reacted very positively to the integration. In the third quarter, our key account business which accounts \u2013 which includes national strategic, assigned and government accounts grew by 17% year-over-year.","To summarize, the headwinds from the integration are largely behind us. And the top line impact from the branch closings should stayed over in the next six months. Our entire field organization has done a great job at business retention and we now have our sales force focused on growth and our fleet is settling into a new footprint and is more available to meet demand.","And we just delivered a record EBITDA margin. Fortunately this is playing out against favorable conditions in the rental industry. However, we\u2019re aware the speculation is out there and we\u2019re watching the macro environment very closely for any signs of deterioration. But we\u2019re not seeing any cost or concern at this time and we don\u2019t see any reason to alter our plan.","As you may know a couple of equipment manufacturers did voice some concerns about the economic recently \u2013 about the economy recently. And while rental companies and equipment manufacturers serve similar customer basis, we believe our industry is in a better position right now because of rental penetration. That\u2019s why our top line is outpaced in construction spending because a very cautiously recovery can be create more demand for rental \u2013 for the rental industry while reducing demand for product purchases.","Now Matt will be giving some color about our performance by region and also describe what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. Overall, they\u2019re feeling optimistic about next year. Global Insight also believes the recovery we will continue and are holding firm to their forecast for an increase between 8% and 9% in equipment rental revenues in 2013 and we share that feel.","And we will be talking to you again on our Investor Day, on December 4th, and we plan to update you on our thoughts on 2013 at that time. Right now, we\u2019re focused on delivering a strong finish to the year that comes down to one word, execution. Now I want to remind everyone that our destination has been long-term profitable growth from day one of our strategy. We put that strategy in place four years ago and at a time our vision was for 40% EBITDA margin within five years.","As you saw last night, we\u2019ve already exceeded that goal and now we\u2019re looking for ways to expand on it. So stay tuned. We\u2019ve lot of confidence in our ability to deliver even greater value for the future.","So now, I will ask Matt to give you an update on our operations, and then Bill will cover the financial results. And after that, we will take your questions. So over to you Matt.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start with the progress report on our integration efforts and then give you a brief overview of market conditions across our regions. On our call in July, we reported that our integration efforts got off to a very strong start and we\u2019ve made significant progress since our call. Our field team has heard me say from the very beginning of this merger that we need to focus on moving the big rocks. This means making sure we\u2019ve communicated with our key customers and our sales territories are realigned to eliminate confusion and that we communicate with our new operational footprint will be to serve our customers.","So let me take a minute to tell you what we\u2019ve done. I will start with the customer first. Our sales team has done a great job of focusing on our key accounts which grew by 17% in Q3. Now this was partially due to the fact that this past quarter we finalized over a 125 new national account agreements. And we\u2019re negotiating while complete the remaining 260 throughout Q4.","Additionally, we realigned over a 1000 sales rep territories. Now this was a large and necessary undertaking due to the overlap in coverage between reps from the two legacy companies. Our reps have now been in their territories for over 60 days and they\u2019re well on their way to further penetrating their new territories and the customers that they\u2019re calling on.","To assist the sales team, we\u2019ve implemented an early warning report for declining revenue customers and we\u2019ve given them multiple tools to identify additional revenue opportunities, like our dormant account program. After eight weeks of this program, we reactivated almost 2,500 accounts that have rented over $60 million worth of fleet. And we feel that this is work well worth doing to help recapture some of the revenue leakage that occurred during our consolidation efforts.","And operationally as Mike mentioned, we completed a 126 branch consolidations in Q3 and that takes our year-to-date total to 187. We\u2019ve integrated the teams into common facilities, one technology platform and most importantly one voice to the customer in the effective markets. We\u2019ve charged forward with an aggressive closure schedule and that speed of execution has allowed us to capture $45 million in cost synergies in Q3. So as a result, we\u2019ve increased our 2012 achieved cost synergy target to a $100 million.","Additionally, we\u2019ve increased the top side of our range of our fully developed synergy guidance from $230 million to $250 million. When I break out the $45 million in cost saved in Q3, closures contributed about $18 million, and field staffing and corporate overhead reduction contributed $11 million each. Those three buckets totaled $40 million of the $45 million we achieved.","We\u2019ve also seen significant improvement in our branch productivity related to cost of rentals. This is specifically evident in markets where we\u2019ve consolidated stores and taken advantage of the economies of scale. Our average store sizes increased by 30% in Q3 year-over-year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re able to grow our fleet by almost 10% over last year, while reducing the headcount that serves that fleet by more than 5.5%.","Now we did face a few bumps in the road while moving through the integration. We\u2019ve seen that our closure markets didn\u2019t grow quite as fast as our non-closure markets. And that\u2019s with this synergy that we feel comfortable we will recover through the focused sales efforts I discussed earlier.","I\u2019d like to emphasize how proud I\u2019m of our employees for coming together as a true team. Almost half of our employees have had their jobs or reporting structure changed in someway as a result of the merger. But their commitment to United Rentals is as strong as ever and this is supported by a voluntary turnover which is down from last year as well as the tremendous engagement we encountered while conducting town halls in over 50 markets.","Now switching over to our Q3 regional results, we saw a positive rental revenue growth in all, but one of our geographic regions. And we had over 27% growth in our specialty regions. Some of the higher growth markets are across the Gulf States and in the Southwest, but we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in Western Canada, the Mountain of west and the Midwest regions. All but one of our business units are seeing strong EBITDA growth and improved rates.","During my travel the past few weeks, I\u2019ve had many long standing customers inform me that their backlog is strong. And they want assurance that we will have the fleet ready to serve their major projects. These comments are consistent with results we\u2019re seeing from our monthly customer surveys where over 90% of participants say they expect their business next year to be at least as good as this year and almost half of those participants feel they will up 10% or more in 2013.","Before I turn the call over to Bill for the financial update, I\u2019d like to state how positive I feel that strategically we\u2019ve never been in a better position to win in the marketplace. And that\u2019s really what this integration is all about. We\u2019ve been building deeper partnerships with our industrial and national accounts, we\u2019re focused on cross selling the strength of each legacy company and we continue to focus on improving our customer scorecard.","Those are the pillars of our strategy and our roadmap to success. So thanks for your time and now over to Bill.","William B. Plummer","Thanks, Matt, and good morning to everyone. As is usual, I will add a little bit more color to the third quarter results and I will also spend little time updating our outlook for the full-year. And before I get started, I will just remind everyone as Michael did that all of the comparisons and comments that we make are about the pro forma company combined basis comparing to as though we\u2019ve combined in the prior period.","So let me start with net revenue first. Net revenue was up 8.9% in the quarter with strong contributions from both rental rate and fleeted on rent. Rates were up 7.5% compared to the third quarter last year and they were 2.8 percentage points better sequentially versus the second quarter of this year.","I will touch on it a bit later, but given the strong pricing performance that we\u2019re seeing throughout, we\u2019re comfortable increasing our outlook for the full-year and now expect rates to be up 7% for the full 2012.","Looking at our volume performance and time utilization, you all know that our measure of time utilization is obviously on rent. That measure was up 7.9% in the quarter to a record for us of $5.2 billion of fleet on rent on average throughout the quarter. So clearly there was a strong demand environment and that certainly supported our investment in the fleet.","Time utilization for the quarter was 69.8% and that is a very strong absolute level and it\u2019s certainly consistent with the demand environment that we\u2019ve been dealing with. Unfortunately, time utilization was down 200 basis points compared to last year and that reflects a few factors. So maybe I will spend a second on those factors.","First as Michael mentioned, we had the consolidation effort really at its peak during the quarter, closing a 187 branches in total, 126 of them happened during the quarter. So that was the largest factor we think in the year-over-year decline and time utilization. The closures were essentially completed by the end of the July, but when you move that much fleet as Matt pointed out when you change that many sales rep territories and leadership changes, it has an impact on the business and we certainly saw that in the third quarter.","The second factor was the higher absolute level of fleet. We\u2019ve been talking about this all year. We have brought in a tremendous amount of new fleet. We spent $1.3 billion on new fleet purchases year-to-date and in any sense that\u2019s a large increase to our fleet overall and it makes it tougher to achieve the same levels of time utilization that we did last year.","Lastly the second half of the year last year was a very robust time utilization environment. It was a record for both companies or the combined companies and that makes for a very difficult set of comparisons this year.","So before I turn to used sales, I\u2019ll spend a couple of minutes on the impact of mix in our rental revenue this quarter. We\u2019ve gotten questions from several folks about the fact that our rates are up 7.5%, our volume is up 7.9%, but we only increased total rental revenue or rental revenue by 8.9%, so where\u2019s the difference? What's the key driver of that negative mix if you will?","In our view the key drivers were \u2013 it started with our monthly mix. Our business shifted more toward monthly during the quarter by a significant amount, 75.5% of our revenues in the quarter were from monthly business and that\u2019s up 270 basis points compared to last year. Now remember the higher proportion of monthly rentals will drive revenue in the quarter down because the revenue per day that you generate from a monthly transaction is lower than it is on a daily and weekly transaction, that\u2019s just a fundamental feature of our pricing structure. So that monthly mix impact was pretty significant in the headwind that we experienced in the quarter.","We also had an impact now from ancillary items. So within our rental revenue, our rentals that are \u2013 items that are ancillary to a rental \u2013 delivery is one example. So when we look at those ancillary items, there are fewer opportunities for us to realize ancillaries when we have more monthly transactions, and it shows up as part of the mix headwind that we\u2019re experiencing.","So for example if you look within our rental revenue and look at just the owned equipment rental, the revenue that comes from the owned equipment being on rent, excluding the ancillaries that was up a very healthy 11.6% in the quarter. But when you look at some of the ancillaries like delivery for example; delivery was only up 1.5%. So that impact also plays to the mix headwind that we\u2019ve seen.","Keep in mind now that this is all very consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing since the last four years. The higher monthly mix certainly brings along a better margin opportunity because it certainly reduces the amount of cost associated with generating that revenue. So when you put it all together we feel very comfortable that the 8.9% revenue growth was a very solid base for driving our business forward and more importantly it allowed us the opportunity to delivery very strong profit improvement.","Speaking of profitability, the numbers you saw. Adjusted EBITDA was $570 million for the quarter and an adjusted margin of 46.8% and as Mike said that\u2019s a record for the Company. That\u2019s an improvement of 700 basis points in margin compared to last year, and it delivered a flow through of 127% for the quarter, so clearly outstanding result on flow through. The synergy contribution is obviously significant there with the synergies adding $45 million in the quarter. But even when you exclude the impact of synergies it was still a very impressive flow through performance, 81% taking out the $45 million from synergies.","When you look at EPS, we reported an adjusted EPS in the quarter of $1.35. We pointed out in our press release last night that, that EPS benefited from a low tax rate 22.3% in the quarter. But even if you use a more normal tax rate it\u2019s an impressive EPS result; we would call it $1.27 if you would use a tax rate right around 35%. So EPS performance was also very strong for the quarter. Before I move to the outlook, let me touch just a couple of minutes on used sales and liquidity.","First on used equipment sales; we generated $101 million of used sales proceeds and that was at a robust 40.3% gross margin and that\u2019s the gross margin adjusted to exclude the impact of the purchase accounting activity. That margin certainly reflects overall strong demand, but we also had a very healthy mix of retail transactions in the quarter as well supporting the margin. When you look at liquidity and our cap structure, as of the end of the quarter we had total liquidity of $751 million and that included $683 million of available capacity in our asset base loan facility.","I\u2019ll point out also that during the quarter we increased the size of our accounts receivable securitization facility. We took it from $300 million up to $475 million and we did that clearly to take advantage of the very low cost of those facilities, very attractive financing and it makes a ton of sense to do so.","So, before I move on to questions and answers, just real quickly on our outlook, to update it. First on rental rate, as we mentioned earlier we expect rates now to be up 7% on the full-year and that\u2019s compared to our prior outlook of 6.5%. On time utilization, we now expect time utilization to be down about a half a point for the full-year but still at a very healthy 67.5% over 2012.","Our CapEx outlook is unchanged. We still expect to spend gross capital of about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with that netting out to a net rental capital of between $1.075 billion and $1.125 billion.","Free cash flow expectations have increased. Previously we were guiding to a free cash usage for the year between $90 million to $140 million. We now expect that free cash usage to be between $25 million and $75 million for the full-year and remember that view of free cash flow excludes the impact of the merger related cost, but it does include the impact of converting the RSC accounts payable policies to the shorter United Rentals payable policies.","Those are the key comments that I\u2019d offer right here and now. Certainly we\u2019ll be glad to address any questions in Q&A. So, if we can ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.","Hey, Mike. Thanks. Good morning, guys and a nice work. If I can make my one question a two parter, the first part would be, could you discuss the utilization trend months to months to months sequentially as you progress through third quarter into fourth quarter. And my second question is; with regard to this CapEx guidance for this year; could you give us an idea of what you\u2019re thinking for next year and how CapEx would compare to this year and perhaps how free cash flow would compare to this year? Thanks very much.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll give you the time and then I\u2019ll shift it over to Bill on the capital. Once you look at July, we were at 68.6%. For August we were at 69.7%. For September we were at 71%. As I mentioned in my opening comments as we stand for the month of October we\u2019re slightly above 72%.","William B. Plummer","And Scott on CapEx, I\u2019ll start with just an additional comment about 2012. We\u2019re maintaining the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, but we\u2019re focused more on the lower-end of that range for 2012 and we think that that\u2019s an appropriate way to think about it right here and now. As we look at 2013, we haven\u2019t definitely set a plan, but our general thought is that, our capital plan will look pretty similar next year to what it does this year, about flat it could be a touch lower and by a touch $50 million is sort of where I define a touch.","If we do what we think we\u2019re going to do next year in terms of operational results, with that kind of a capital plan our free cash flow is probably going to be in the range of $400 million to $500 million. That\u2019s consistent with the forecast that we put in the S-4 that we released earlier this year and it\u2019s still consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about the next year or so.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, thanks Bill. I appreciate it.","William B. Plummer","No problem.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Great, thanks. Just following up on the last question; so the free cash flow will continue to improve over the next year, you\u2019ve upped the guide and you\u2019ve \u2013 you started to build out your fleet early in the cycle maybe ahead of the cycle and you\u2019re going to see the benefits. So you\u2019ve laid out some targets for reducing leverage over the next 12 months, any update to the specific leverage ratio you\u2019re looking at Bill, say a year from now. And then beyond that, what do you see happening with free cash flow beyond 2013, and what's your ultimate thought\u2019s on where the leverage is going to go other uses of cash and so forth?","William B. Plummer","Thanks Vance. So, we\u2019ve spent some time recently with our Board talking about this very topic and we\u2019ve aligned around a view that we will be targeting a lower level of leverage to sustain over the next number of years. So if you look at leverage just as total debt to EBITDA and I know that\u2019s overly simplistic, but just to keep it simple we\u2019re now targeting a range of between 2.5 and 3.5 times total debt to EBITDA and we feel comfortable that we can maintain that range over the next number of years and it reflects the cash flow profile that we expect to see over the next few years starting with that $400 million to $500 million range next year. 2.5 to 3.5 will be a normal operating range, so in good time we\u2019ll trend down towards the lower-end of that range.","Right now we expect by the end of next year, if you look in our investor deck if we give you some very broad brush forecast. We expect that by the end of the next year we\u2019ll be solidly in the middle of that range, right at about three times, and from being just below four times on a trailing 12 basis right here and now. So nice robust de-levering over the next year to two, and we think that it makes sense for us to maintain those leverage levels as we go forward.","What do we do with the cash flow beyond 2013, can I answer that question next year. I think we want to think very carefully about where we reinvest the free cash flow that we have. We\u2019re certainly going to be bringing down debt consistently over the next several years and \u2013 but we also want to make sure that we\u2019re looking for the opportunities that makes sense for our investors.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then may be just a clarification on something earlier. You talked about the shift towards the monthly renting and the impact that, that has which makes perfect sense, but I might have missed it, but what's driving the shit itself. I would have thought in this uncertain environment with the elections coming up and so forth that, if anything rental periods would get even shorter. So, what do you think the driver is there?","William B. Plummer","I think it\u2019s the strategy. We\u2019ve been targeting the key account groups that historically have rented the equipment for longer periods of time, and as we grow the share of revenue from those accounts, it\u2019s a natural outgrowth of being with those accounts and its playing very well. It\u2019s playing very much according to the strategy. As you grow with those folks you give yourself a better margin opportunity, because the cost fall away and it\u2019s driving to that result as we speak.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi, David.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Hi, good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland","Good morning.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Hi my question is about rates heading into \u201913. Two angles on it; when you speak with your larger customers, some of the larger accounts you mentioned earlier you\u2019re in conversations with. How are the rates looking from current levels looking out to the new contracts for \u201913? And then secondarily if we kept the rates where they are today and just ran them out flat; how do you see that rolling into next year for full-year rental rates or maybe how first quarter \u201913 would look? Just trying to get some sensitivity.","Matthew Flannery","David this is Matt, I\u2019ll talk about the key account rate harmonizations that we\u2019re doing. We have \u2013 as I stated we\u2019ve already inked and completed a third of those. We\u2019re in negotiations with the other two-thirds, and the improvement is falling in line with our overall improvement and certainly we feel it accretive to our goals.","Michael J. Kneeland","And David on 2013; if we do what we expect to do what we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do at 7% for rate this year, that will give us a carryover benefit next year something like 2.5% even if we don\u2019t advance rates any at all during 2013. So, pretty good tailwind to start, but let me be clear. We certainly do expect to drive rates beyond that carryover, but we\u2019ve got a nice starting point.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Okay. And then on the debt reduction comment. The total debt at the end of this quarter over trailing EBITDA, pro forma is about 3.9%.","Michael J. Kneeland","That\u2019s right.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","To get to your full-year free cash flow, the fourth quarter is going to be significant cash flow. And then you have the $400 million to $500 million as a baseline you\u2019re talking about for next year. You\u2019re using total debt in your comment, a set of net debt, just so I understand what you plan on doing with the cash that comes in, in the fourth quarter and next year just for the pure calc? I was trying to understand the exact math because the 3.5% seems like something especially EBITDA grows at all you\u2019re going to be below that pretty quickly. I just want to make sure how you look on that calculation?","Michael J. Kneeland","So, the cash that flows in during the fourth quarter we\u2019ll immediately reduce the ABL and that will drive down that overall debt through the ABL balance. And then as we go forward as I said, we\u2019re going to be right at about three times debt to EBITDA by the end of next year on our current view. And so you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll certainly be in the lower-end of the range pretty quickly, and we\u2019ll be looking very carefully at how we should deploy that cash flow with a bias toward initially continuing to pay down our overall debt balance.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","[Obviously] I\u2019m trying to back you into giving an EBITDA guidance for next year essentially because if you got \u2026","Michael J. Kneeland","I might avoid it.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Yeah, I know, but I mean, so you can certainly do the math now, right? I mean you\u2019re basically saying that the total debt the way I\u2019m calculating this quarter was about $7.375 billion. You\u2019ve generate 375 of cash roughly in the fourth quarter to get to the free cash flow full-year roughly. So if you\u2019re at $7 billion going into next year and you generate say 450 mid-point, you\u2019re down to 655 for the year divided by three, it\u2019s implying EBITDA next year slightly below 2.2.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yeah.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","And I just want to make sure that\u2019s \u2013 for me person that\u2019s a little bit lower, but I am thinking for \u201913, so I\u2019m just trying to make sure you\u2019re not backing into something, you\u2019re not trying to imply?","Michael J. Kneeland","No we\u2019re certainly not trying to imply a specific number certainly not that low, right. You look at the S-4 data that we put out earlier this year. If you just add those, the RSC and the URI together plus synergies I think you get a number that\u2019s beyond 2.2, so that\u2019s certainly not what we\u2019re trying to imply. I think there are a huge number of assumptions that we would have to guide you to in order to get to the right number and that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to avoid that discussion right here now because there are just too many assumptions to walk down that road.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Okay. So we\u2019ll leave it wherever it is, either a movement in the $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow and\/or if that\u2019s what you generate in cash you\u2019ll be below at three times. All right, so if the EBITDA is above 2.2 and you generate that cash you\u2019re below three times total debt-to-EBITDA \u2013 I mean, its kind of leave it as that, right? You\u2019re not implying below 2.2 of EBITDA next year?","Michael J. Kneeland","We are not implying an EBITDA of that level.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Okay, just making sure. Okay. Thank you very much.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks, David.","David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group","Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys. I just have a high level question for you Mike. It feels like the RSC deal has kind of really steered the pot in the industry. I guess with almost six months under your belt, I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re seeing competitors respond to the deal. Specifically any color on how industry pricing has been impacted, the prospects for future consolidation or just how competitors maybe thinking about fleet growth going forward?","Michael J. Kneeland","Yeah well I will tell you \u2013 I think if you \u2013 obviously you\u2019ve been hearing from all the other competitors that are out there publicly and those of that public debt out there, their rates all have been improving and also its supported by Rouse what he\u2019s been \u2013 he recently had a call I think yesterday with one of the analyst. So that supports that data that overall the industry is improving on price. So that continues to grow.","With regards to the way people are putting their fleet in, I think each one has their own strategy on where they\u2019re going and what they\u2019re trying to do. Each one is completely different. When you look at what we are doing, we said we\u2019re going to focus on diversifying our customer mix, our portfolio and we\u2019ve done that. And then we\u2019re enhancing that, we\u2019re growing across our footprint.","We have the broadest footprint, that\u2019s one of our \u2013 what I believe is a significant advantage for United Rentals particularly with larger accounts and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on, and we\u2019re utilizing the best of both worlds between both organizations and growing on that. Does that mean we have competitors in certain markets? Yeah absolutely, but on balance, I think that the industry is still reeling back from the declines of \u201909 on the rate and they haven\u2019t really levered-up or I should say levered-up or brought a lot of fleet in as if yet, I think it\u2019s still challenging for a lot of smaller tier players to get access to capital. It\u2019s better than it was, but not where it was before the downturn.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So I guess with respect to the last part on the fleet growth side. Is it your expectation and that industry fleet growth is going to be somewhat muted next year?","Michael J. Kneeland","That's hard for me to say. I don\u2019t know what happens in the credit market, if things get opened up, I don't know. It\u2019s hard for me to call. I can only tell you what Bill mentioned, how we\u2019re thinking about the world and what we\u2019re focused on.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc","Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Michael J. Kneeland","You\u2019re welcome.","William B. Plummer","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Good morning, guys.","Michael J. Kneeland","Good morning.","William B. Plummer","Good morning.","Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group","One thing I wanted to do is just kind of clarify what specifically changed relative to your previous expectation on the synergy front. You were able to get 12 up to 100 million for cost synergies and now, the fully developed range of 230 on the cost side \u2013 moving up from 230 to 250 on the cost side?","Matthew Flannery","Sure. This is Matt. We \u2013 first of all for the accelerated achievement of the branch closures and some of the other corporate savings that we\u2019ve got that guided us to the $100 million for this year. As far as for the top end of the range, we are starting to see that there may be more opportunity and some of the central dispatching we are doing, some of the branch efficiencies I mentioned earlier about the productivity improvements in some of our larger scale facilities and we think that there is some upside there that we are going to get at and we should definitely be able to get at before our fully developed plan in 2014.","Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on utilization, I mean, I was noticing for fleet mix that aerials ticked down sequentially as a percentage of your fleet. Was there any impact there on utilizations or anything else based on fleet mix that you would want to call out?","Michael J. Kneeland","This is Mike. I\u2019d tell you that it has some effect over time. It\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t look at it that way, but it\u2019s a valid point. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re expanding what we call the other, inside of that you would see the power side, the trench side, and the tool side because we are going to leverage our footprint. We are going to leverage the relationships that we\u2019ve and expand the expertise that RSC brings to the table.","So to some degree you will see some changes. I think when we do our investor presentation, we will try to give a better view on what that would look like. It\u2019s too early. We're going through it and we\u2019re trying to see what the opportunities are. We know they\u2019re there and we are actually investing so that we can capitalize on it.","Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thank you.","William B. Plummer","Thanks, George.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","You've noted time utilization has been improving sequentially over the past four months, reaching just slightly north of 72% so far in October. Could you give us color on what\u2019s driving the improvement and whether you expect these factors to persist?","Matthew Flannery","Sure, George. This is Matt. I think what has driven the improvement is demand first and foremost, but we\u2019ve also moved further away from those closures that started towards the end of June and as Mike stated, we are really ramped up between July and August and we're starting to move away from that.","So, our team is much more focused on trying to grow revenue versus our early focus candidly was making sure we stabilized the base business. So, I think that\u2019s given us some tailwind in time utilization.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yeah, I will also add that I made the comment \u2013 in my opening comments about penetration. Penetration to me is one of the drivers in the industry. It\u2019s also a seasonality. The third quarter is always our strongest, so we did see it build up and as Matt mentioned \u2013 as we mentioned in the call \u2013 in our results that we did have a disruption. But there is a seasonal trend, but when you step back away there is a shift towards rental penetration.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi, Phil.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities","Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland","Good morning.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities","I was hoping you could walk me through the different components of what changed in your free cash flow guidance from previously being negative $90 million to $140 million to now being negative $25 million to $75 million, is that just better EBITDA and less net CapEx or is there some interest savings there? Could you just walk us through the pieces?","William B. Plummer","Yeah, Phil. The biggest drivers are in working capital and CapEx. Working capital we \u2013 as I said earlier, we \u2013 we've revised our expectation about the impact of shortening the payment terms for fleet purchases for what we buy for RSC, that was probably the biggest factor. And then we are working at the lower end of our CapEx range and that contributed a little bit more as well. So, those were the two predominant drivers.","There is a little bit of a benefit from profitability improvement as we started to realize a little bit more in the way of synergies, but it\u2019s CapEx and working capital, the big drivers.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities","Great. And Bill if I could sneak a second one in there, earlier you gave guidance for 2013 in terms of CapEx, but you talked about gross. Can you talk about on a net basis, if possible?","William B. Plummer","So, earlier I was talking about gross. Net is probably not going to be dramatically different than this year either. We are on target to realize new sales proceeds somewhere around $440 million and it\u2019s probably going to be something like that again next year.","Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thank you.","William B. Plummer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Michael J. Kneeland","Good morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Bill can you talk about how monthly rates you\u2019re signing today compared to prior cycle highs? I think spot rates are back at prior cycle highs and I\u2019m wondering if your new monthly businesses as well, if you can give us a broad update? Thanks.","William B. Plummer","So without the specifics here in front of me, Jerry, I do know that what you call spot rates are \u2013 let\u2019s call it what we call it, our daily rates are already above the prior cycle highs. The weekly rates are about at the prior peak and we're still below on the monthly rates, somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% below the prior peak. So, some room to go on the monthlies to get to the prior peak.","Whenever people raise this point though, I always have to ask the question, why does the prior peak matter? Is the prior peak some kind of physical law that limits where rates can go? We don\u2019t believe so. That was five years ago and the environment is different now and so, I think it\u2019s interesting to talk about where we are versus the peak. I don\u2019t know that it really defines where we can go though in the future.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Yeah, so the question is from the standpoint of understanding how much room the monthlies have to catch up because obviously they roll on a delayed basis, so I\u2019m assuming the 7% number you mentioned is the entire book of monthly business and I\u2019m wondering if you are comfortable commenting on the monthly business that you are signing today not the overall book?","William B. Plummer","No. That\u2019s the monthly rate that we\u2019re experiencing today compared to what we experienced back in the early part of \u201907.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Okay. And in terms of thinking about the timing of the CapEx spend over 2013; I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us more context there? Earlier this year you mentioned that you because of how front half weighted the CapEx budget was there were some utilization pressure, I\u2019m just wondering how that factors into your timing decision of when to pick deliveries next year and how should we think about utilizations heading into next year, first quarter looks like a pretty tough comp. So I\u2019m wondering and if you could just provide some broader brush comments to the extent you are comfortable on those topics? Thanks.","William B. Plummer","Yeah. Just, I think next year you will see timing of our CapEx that\u2019s more normal. There was a specific strategy behind front-end loading of the CapEx this year and I don\u2019t know Matt if you want to flush that out a little bit?","Matthew Flannery","Yeah. We did a big pre-buy of multitude reasons last year and we won\u2019t need to do all of that this year and we won\u2019t need the timing to be the same. If projects accelerate and demand peaks up we will always hold the right to adjust, but I don\u2019t think it will be as frontloaded next year.","Michael J. Kneeland","Jerry just on your comment about the time utilization next year, we will try to give some guidance later on and during our investor presentation on the fourth. But to your point on the seasonal swing, we did have a very mild winter. I don't know what that is going to deal with us this year, but on balance we will continue to strive to expand it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS. Your question please.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank","Hey, good morning. It's actually Eric Crawford on for Henry.","Michael J. Kneeland","Hi. How are you?","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank","Hey, good. Thanks. Bigger picture on time utilization, once you get past the branch consolidations, adjust the fleet mix and the business mix, what\u2019s the ideal time utilization for the new URI? What\u2019s the right range for the business post transformation?","Michael J. Kneeland","You know that\u2019s \u2013 I think an earlier question we had was around the same thing and we are going to kind of give some guidance. We have to go through, we\u2019re going to take a look at what is coming in from the \u2013 all of the regions on what capital they want to spend. As I mentioned before, we are expanding into the trench, the other side of the business, the tools as well as the power, which historically runs at lower time utilization with very nice returns.","So as we go through our business process, and our budget process, we are going to take a look at that and then we are going to come back on the fourth and give you some guidance. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to change dramatically because there is still opportunities we think in specific markets and areas that we can do better, but you can look forward on the fourth.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just a point of clarification on the rates, how they trended through the quarter?","Michael J. Kneeland","They \u2013 for July, they were up 7.5%, for August, they were up 8%, and for September, 7.1%.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thank you.","William B. Plummer","Let me just tack on to that real quickly. So that gave us the 7.5% year-over-year rate that we realized for the quarter, on our way to 7% for the full-year. I just wanted \u2013 I think there is \u2013 I\u2019ve heard people talk about fourth quarter year-over-year rate realization and I\u2019ve heard some pretty interesting numbers. So just to be clear, we think about the fourth quarter year-over-year rate realization needed to get to that 7% for the full-year as being about 6%. I\u2019ve heard some numbers that were significantly higher than that and I just wanted to make sure that everyone heard it here that we are thinking of fourth quarter year-over-year of about 6%.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yilma Abebe from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.","Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Thank you. I was hoping if you could comment on how you\u2019re looking at an overall credit risk and leverage specifically. The 2.5 to 3 times leverage target that you have, how does that compare in terms of the Company, it looked that leverage pre-recession as a standalone company. I was hoping if you can put this 2.5 to 3 times in historical context for us?","William B. Plummer","Yes, sure. We used to talk about the preferred leverage range being in the 3.5 to 4.5 times range and certainly 2.5 to 3.5 represents a shift in our thinking there. To give some context during the absolute depth of the recession in 2009, we peaked up just above 5 times on a trailing \u201912 EBITDA basis. Clearly in the extreme, a higher leverage than we would want in our normal range. But that gives you a little bit of context of where we\u2019ve been over the last number of years. So, 2.5 to 3.5 times is fundamentally different and I think it reflects our view that we want to maintain a reasonable level of leverage to make for very efficient capital structure. But we don\u2019t want to go too far because you lose that advantage as you go too low in leverage.","On the other side, you don\u2019t want to get too high because it really does amplify the volatility and cash flow and returns that we have from the business and that\u2019s something that hurts the returns for equity investors and makes the debt investors \u2013 puts them in a riskier position as well.","Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","So if I can add on to that, so \u2013 why do you have a lower \u2013 what\u2019s the driver behind a lower target in terms of leverage based on [multiple] context? May I know, why have you reduced that target, if you can give a little bit context on some of the drivers behind this lower leverage target now?","Michael J. Kneeland","I think we \u2013 again, it\u2019s about reducing the volatility of our results, so overall is an important driver for why we want to target a lower range. It will solidify our access to debt financing, although it\u2019s pretty good right here now, but we want to make even more sure that we got free access to debt financing. It will reduce the volatility and cash flow and equity returns and that should make the equity more attractive. And it just gives us a firmer foundation for driving the strategy of the Company, whether we grow organically, whether we position ourselves for further acquisitions, it's all held by the somewhat lower leverage. So that was \u2013 those were the main drivers of the thought process.","Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Michael J. Kneeland","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.","Michael J. Kneeland","Thanks, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I want to make sure that everyone goes onto our website to see our latest Investor Relation presentation. I had some new slides out there that hopefully you will find helpful. It talks more about the business and how we\u2019re seeing the world and we look forward to talking to you again on December 4th at our Investor Day.

My. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1st in New York. We hold this conference every two years and the webcast is the most dependent event. This time, we\u2019re taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. I hope you join us. Now, let's go into the quarter.","Our operating environment played out largely as we expected, demand continue to trend up driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continue to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to national accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.","Now, these gains were offset by three ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas, and the current fleet balance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor. I guess this backdrop we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We were pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share and as well as adjusted EBITDA of 747 million and a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust 846 million through September while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.","Now, based on this performance and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model our business. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range, we previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate declines we forecasted earlier with no significant impact time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than a billion dollars which would exceed our original guidance. And as we considered the best way to service our large contract wins, we made by and up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So, no surprise as in terms of the cycle or our own performance, I would characterize as it's being right on track.","Next, I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new constructions starts are up over 22% sequentially in August with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Non-residential starts increased significantly overall a 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show the backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year. And many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.","Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospectus throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past nine months. And the September employment report was also encouraging, which show that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months. While there is some evidence of headwinds such as a modest contraction in the architectural billing index in August, overall the market feels positive to us. So, it's a widely marketplace for us in the U.S. with the strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West coasts. On the West Coast, we have four major construction projects that will run through at least mid-year 2017. Another two sites are staring up this quarter. Solar power and automotive, our two key verticals in government spending in California remains robust.","In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past two quarters with the healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plans, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls. Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plants are underway in South Carolina. The Southeast metro areas overall continue to represent large opportunities for both our gen rent and specialty operations.","Now, I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast who've been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stealer job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. And the restoration in these states could take years to complete. As to U.S. snapshot by contract, the Canadian economy is still a challenge compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%, and fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry and balance of fleet.","So, we're walking at that line really well in 2016, continued to use a balance strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very important manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets. The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx as we noted before is our specialty segment, in the third quarter especially had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015, within that segment revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these two increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in Pump where our strategy of end market diversification is paying off. And we seem to be a turning point and neutralizing to drag from upstream oil and gas.","And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We\u2019ve gone from zero to over a $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know, it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers, who want the digital convenience and summer from first-time customers though achieving both of our objectives of e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current based and to capture more customers to our new channel.","So to recap the quarter, there were no surprises. The Company is solidly on track, and we\u2019re continued to focus with the many leverage within our control. Demand is also on track based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has one way ahead. And our full year results should be nearly upper half of our prior guidance and a number of key metrics, and we expect our free cash flow to be more than a $1 billion this year. Now, we are mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us great deal of confidence in managing the business for strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today.","So with that, I\u2019ll ask Bill to discuss the numbers and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we\u2019ll step to the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let\u2019s start with rental revenue that was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over last year as was the volume component change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. The offsets to those were rental rates that down 1.7%, translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline, and our replacement CapEx inflation which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline.","The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year, so all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3 decline. Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it's still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%, so a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch on that more in the Q&A if there are questions.","Our used equipment sales results for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue, that was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we saw last year. So, that decline in revenue, we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4% and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year, and certainly that benefitted from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions this year compare to last year.","Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA, the 747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. The inflation, however, costs us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another 12. Merit increases, we always call out worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind and then the mix and other was $2 million positive impact. So, those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%, that was down 80 basis points versus last year and again it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. Just a quick update within that EBITDA performance was our lien contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our lien and other savings initiatives and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and as you all know that we are targeting the 100 million run rate by the end of this year and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that 100 million target by the end of December.","Our adjusted EPS $2.58 for the quarter was up a $0.01 versus last year and again it had de minimis impact from currency in the year and obviously reflected the impacts of the operational results that we talk about, as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. Free cash flow during the quarter -- year-to-date period, free cash flow was $846 million and that was better by almost $340 million compared to last year.","The primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending that was worth about $280 million compared to last year, right for the year-to-date period. We also had a lower cash taxes roughly 41 million and the timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year roughly $110 million. Those were the positives and they offset on a year-over-year basis to decline in adjusted EBITDA that we seen year-to-date.","Our net debt finish the quarter at $7.7 billion and that was down roughly $640 million, compared to where it was in September of last year. Now, a good portion of that change is timing, so don\u2019t extrapolate to the year-end. But we\u2019re still going to finish with very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position, and I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we\u2019ve been experiencing as well.","On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million that was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year year-to-date CapEx spend to a 1.145 billion, on our way to that 1.2 billion to 1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which again I\u2019ll touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million, that's up from last year and primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales, as well as some timing effects. When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures particularly rate as we discussed previously.","On liquidity, we finish the quarter with just under 1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about 720 million or so of ABL capacity available to us, as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. The capital structure just briefly, you all recall that during the second quarter, we had some redemption. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7.375 note. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together for the year, we\u2019re at a annualize savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods.","So quick update on the share repurchase program, we brought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3 that brings our year-to-date total for sharing purchase to $476 million. If you extent the look back to the beginning of this current authorization, the billion dollar authorization, we\u2019ve now spent $587 million of that billion dollar of authorization that we have. Our plan for the remainder of this year to continue on the pace that we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve been talking about a pace of spend of roughly 150, 160 a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4.","We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. Just an update on the covenant and cash position, we finish the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. Let we finish out with an update to our outlook for the full year and quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points, we\u2019ve narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within the $100 million range between 5.650 billion -- total revenue is within the range of 5.650 billion to 5.750 billion. EBITDA, we narrowed to a $50 million range with the bottom of the range at 2.7 billion going up to 2.75 billion. And you've all seen the rental rate guidance we narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines for the full year.","I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plan right now, we're calling in a range of 1.2 billion to 1.25 billion with any incremental spend being targeted at specific projects that we've been awarded and are need to spend in order to support those customer needs. And finally, we mentioned that our improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion; call it $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. Regards to October, our rates performance so far in October is trending toward a flat to slightly down result for the full months of October on a sequential month basis.","And if you look at where we are on time utilization for the month of October, month-to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year. And if you look at it just on a one day snapshot as of today we are actually up a 100 basis points over where we were on the comparable day last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would need something like 80 basis points each month or remainder of the year in order to hit that new time utilization guidance.","So, those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there, and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions-and-answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.","Robert Wertheimer","Pretty straight forward, so thanks for that. I actually have just kind of more general question. As you see your national competitors expand and then well I just had a sort of five-year plan, that was put out, I mean as they come into market or expanded markets for you, are you seeing most of the shared come out from the smaller, less formal competitors in the world. Are we seeing a steady, the big people in the industry steadily winning out of the smaller ones or do you see a big depth in each market as I do? I'm just little bit curious, if the expansion is accelerated in the consolidation of the industry. Thanks.","Matthew Flannery","So, Robert, this is Matt. I think everybody is running their playbook and we are aware that we have one national competitor that's still got some growth ahead of them from a filling out their footprint. But at the small de minimis market share that they are at, I'm not sure that drives the changes in the market place as much as the other 70% that we don\u2019t have visibility to, for the 25 years in this business that I've been in any market I participated in has somebody trying to get some shift, for various different reasons. So, this is part of being the rental business, you are going to need to sometimes protect share, sometimes gain share. I'll tell you that where we are focused on in making sure we are not just chasing the last dollar of revenue, but profitability remains our focus regardless of what anybody else is doing in. And just to put context, when you think about all the local regional and maybe some semi-national competitors, it\u2019s a competitive market, but there is a lot of demand. And we feel that the absorption is better off today than it was six months ago of the fleet in the industry, and we\u2019re encourage by that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Nicole DeBlase","So my first question is around oil and gas. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what you saw during the quarter with respect to the different verticals, so like upstream, midstream and downstream, and is there anything notably improving at all given what we've seen with the oil price so far?","Matthew Flannery","Nicole, this is Matt. I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been much improvement in the upstream. There has been some noise about the rig count being slightly up over a much lower base, and we even have put out what we call few frac packs, but really a small amount compared to historically what we used to out to those basis. The good news is, we do feel it\u2019s bottomed out. And so, we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not counting on much of an uptick in upstream right now, but we are positioned in the case, there is one. I think the surprising element that not everybody on the call may recognize is that refining is still pretty robust end market for us. We're up almost 10% in refining on a year-over-year basis. So, not all oil and gas is a challenge for us, just really the upstream. And we\u2019re encourage by that, and we think this fourth quarter there will be even more activity, a lot of turnaround activity that our customers are speaking of, so we feel pretty good about that sector.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Thanks Matt, that\u2019s helpful. And then kind of on a similar topic, if we could talk a little bit about Canada, you guys provided a little bit of color and opening remarks. But have you seen any signs of stabilization in Canada or trends still deteriorating?","Matthew Flannery","I would say similarly that Canada, the good news is that they bottomed out. The difference is, we still have some -- I think we still have some more year-over-year headwinds in Canada than we do just strictly in upstream. But the team up there is actually fought pretty well to even getting some sequential positives in the last couple of months; just a year-over-year headwind is still significant. Our rent revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate that was a 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume there, what we see on rent only down 4% and that\u2019s after we pulled over 8% fleet out of there. So, we feel, we\u2019ve right-sized our business from a fleet headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whenever they get some tailwinds at their back. So, they\u2019ve done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our position. Hopefully, next year, they get some tailwinds.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC. Your question please.","Seth Weber","So, I want to ask about the large contract wins that you called out in the press release. I mean, can you give us any color on what that involves? Were those conquest wins from other rental companies or those projects that the companies had previously furnished equipment themselves internally? And can you maybe give us some idea the duration of this project to justify going out and buying new equipment at a time when utilization levels are okay, but they\u2019re not rising? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Yes, this is Mike. Let me just say that, it's always competitive about there. So regardless of when you say, are we taking this or away from somebody, it is a competitive marketplace. So it's very broad. We were very fortunate to be able to be - to take a multiyear contract that we need to make sure that we be able to meet the customer demand. As Matt mentioned earlier, we've been very good about looking at our fleet, managing our fleet, and if you remind everybody that we really didn\u2019t put any growth capital in our core business into all this year. So it has been by moving fleet around. We exhausted our resources in looking at what is needed, and by the way as we said, we would spend up to and that's still yet to be determined. But I thought it was prudent to make sure that we communicated that to everybody. If there is an opportunity for us to be able to reposition fleet at that time, to satisfy that, we'll do that. But right here in now and as Bill mentioned about what we're seeing in October on utilization is actually up year-to-date and on average for the month of October. So, the demand is there as Matt said earlier.","Matthew Flannery","Yes, I think Mike covered it well said. But I would say just the simply answer, it's a yes on that these are long-term projects. And the amount of fleet that we need to fund for one specific plant award, and then a couple of large projects that match with Mike referred to in his opening comments, including some nice infrastructure projects. This represents a very small single digit percentage of what would be needed on the life for that project, so we'll be able to take existing capacity to put on this project. But if we don\u2019t feel these immediate needs that we don\u2019t have available right now, we don\u2019t get to participate in the other 90% plus of this project. So, these projects will mostly be served by the $9 billion of fleet that we are already on.","William Plummer","And just to emphasize, I know you know this, but to emphasize, even if we spend the incremental 50, the cash flow for the year still in that 1 billion to 1.1 billion range. So, it includes the possibility of spending that incremental 50.","Seth Weber","Sure. I appreciate that's helpful. Thanks, Bill. And then just a quick follow-up on the lean initiatives, it sounds like you said you are very close to kind of hitting your target for this year, for exiting the year. So, should we expect to hear new initiatives at the Analyst Meeting, additional efficiency or cost measures that you are talking about for 2017?","William Plummer","Yes, we're still deciding exactly how we are going to approach that Investor Day, but I think it's fair to say that we will be talking about initiatives that we think will have positive impact in our financial performance, over the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","David Raso","When I think about where your better visibility lies, I would I think would be national accounts and maybe large projects. So, if you can keep your answer to those accounts, those projects, what are you seeing and when you reprise national accounts on pricing? And then also how you think about looking into the first half of 2017, is the utilization still growing on those accounts in first half 2017 versus first half 2016? Obviously, I'm trying to think about the fourth quarter, you feel pretty good about utilization growing. I think you said about 80 bps. Rates obviously seasonally were down November, December, but in general rates were still a little bit of struggle sequentially as we saw in August and September. So, not the short-term business where you really have visibility, are you re-pricing national accounts at a higher or lower levels and what kind of visibility do you have on the utilization into next year?","Matthew Flannery","So, David, this is Matt. I would say on national account pricing, what we\u2019re experienced on a year-over-year perspective from national accounts does not differ much from what we see in our overall business. Now, admittedly, they are all coming off different baselines. So you could imagine that national accounts are going to leverage that spend. But that\u2019s already built into the baseline, so we\u2019re not seeing a tremendous amount of difference between our overall business rate performance and national account. What we are seeing and it\u2019s a big part of our focus strategically is that our national account growth in Q2 was higher than what are overall growth was as a company. So to your point, there is greater visibility into it. It\u2019s already such a big part of our business, and we still have such an established baseline. But I don\u2019t think, there is a lot of headwind to a tailwind by customer segment because they're pretty well established. But the growth and the demand is still there in that space and that remains key focus. And they do most of the large projects, so they kind to go hand and hand when your question was about project and national accounts.","David Raso","And that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure, and we all can have our own view on the shorter term rentals swing on how we view activity for next year. At least the start the year still sounds like more of a lean on utilization growth, and the rate for now we could all assume what we want. But it does seem like the rate is necessarily growing on these new accounts, it\u2019s more about utilization and then make your own call about the shorter term projects?","Matthew Flannery","I would necessary say because remember embedded in that national account pricing experience is the largest headwind that we have. Most of our oil and gas business was national account business. So that national account to similar to the Company average had to absorb almost all of the oil and gas experience, which is negative on the year-over-year perspective. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessary characterize it that way. The truth is, we'll find out in the future. But as we sit here today and where our business is today, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I would actually say, they\u2019ve absorbed more pain overall in that business.","David Raso","So when we start re-pricing those contracts and that will be an interesting thing to delve into. When do those contracts come up? I know you\u2019re generalizing a lot of different accounts, but when, I mean, want to be positive and say, hey, oil is a little bit higher today and is that a different tenor in the conversation about what you could charge? When do those conversations start-up?","Matthew Flannery","So the 25% on net of fixed-price all had different expiration dates. And most of them are multiple years, so it\u2019s not really a clean answer for you. I would say that, it\u2019s throughout the year. As far as the projects, they will price accordingly. And it really depends more on what market projects are in as far as the price volatility and who is more capable of supplying of the assets that are needed. And we feeling on some of the ones that we recently won, we\u2019re very well position. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on where we\u2019re very well positioned versus chasing down somewhere where we may not have it as much a competitive advantage, and that\u2019s part of our focus on profitable growth versus just revenue for the sake of revenue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","You're at the point in the rental season where a lot of re-change co-insides with the equipment coming off rent, which implies less control over rate compared to the beginning of the cycle. In line of this, what factors help give you confidence that rates will come in at the higher end of your prior guidance?","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike. And I'll ask Matt and Bill also to chime in. But as you heard from Bill that currently our utilization is up nicely on a year-over-year for the months, so that continues. You also heard that our rates are flat to slightly down. I think the industry overall is being more responsible in the way in which they are managing it. The imbalance is continuing to get better and better, so I give the industry a lot of credit for being responsible. So that would be part of it. There is going to be a necessity for the industry as a total to try to achieve higher pricing, or drive better efficiencies, or manage their business much more efficiently. So that to me gives me confidence as I see that those trends play out as we've seen it over the course of the year. And Matt or Bill, you want to add anything more to that?","William Plummer","I'd say in addition to that, the math gets me confidence right. I mean we've now experienced 9 to 12 of the year, right. The remaining three months are going to be -- will make it pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers, in order to get to that 2.1 decline in rental rates for the full year. October, November, December would all have to be down two times each. It's not a ridiculous notion, but in order to get for the down 2.3 scenario for the full year each of those months would have to be down 0.6 sequentially.","I think it's highly unlikely that we are going to do that and certainly even more unlikely that, it will be worse than that. So I just look at the raw mathematics that what it would take in order to come outside of the range of the rates that we've given, that 2.1 to 2.3 seems pretty well assured and it's not ridiculous to think that could we see minus 0.2 each month for the remainder of the year. And it's not completely ridiculous even if we didn\u2019t see minus 0.2, if we saw something worse than like November, December. We're still going to end up in a pretty decent place within that 2.1 to 2.3 decline range.","One other point just to preempt answer that, we may get from someone. Our carryover for next year, if we hit the 2.1 scenario would be positive 0.1 for the full year. Right so, if we finish the year October, November, December down 0.2 each months sequentially that gives us the full year 2.1 decline, and our carryover would go into the next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flipside just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3 scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 0.9%. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in order to get the positive rate, but certainly in the current environment that would be a tougher starting point, but still one that doesn\u2019t make 2017 a complete wash. So that math is what gives me confidence George in saying that we are going to be in that 2.1 to 2.3 range that we gave","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you, Mike and Bill. Just housekeeping question around the guidance. Free cash flow guidance is increasing by about 100 million but EBITDA going up by 50 million. Can you talk about where that bridge is coming from in terms of cash flow?","Michael Kneeland","Sure. To be clear the EBITDA guidance range, the bottom of that range end up, it went up by 50 million. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s exactly accurate to say EBITDA guidance went up 50 million. But try to be a little bit more helpful of the 100 million or so increase in our free cash flow guidance, the bulk of it was driven by of refine in our view of working capital uses during the course of the year and a reduction in our view about how much non-rental CapEx were going to spent over the course of the year. That working capital, there is a contribution from accounts receivable and the contribution from timing of payables and the non-rental CapEx was just a refinement in our view about what is that we\u2019re going to spend in the way of leasehold improvements and non-rental assets like delivery trucks and service trucks. So working capital and non-rental CapEx were the primary drivers of that improvement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mili Pothiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Mili Pothiwala","Thanks. My question is on M&A. So, you\u2019ve been pretty clear about your priorities here and your preference for specialty. But I guess as you look at the industry, do you see scope for further consolidation in this end market environment i.e., could this be away for some of your larger competitors to gain share?","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike. M&A has always been part of our overview and strategy. It really comes down to timing. It comes down to price. It comes down to two individuals coming together and agreeing. But yes, we think consolidation will continue to play out overtime within our industry. Timing is always one where you don\u2019t always hit to pick and choose your time, but we have, we\u2019re very, I would say very discipline in our approach of how we go about it. So, there is a lot of things that we look at and we\u2019re pretty stringent as to the hurdles that we have to go forward. So, I'd say it will continue. There will be further consolidation in our industry overtime.","Mili Pothiwala","I guess how would you rate the pipeline right now just kind of trying to hone in on how people are thinking about M&A in the context of the current and market environment? Is there have you noticed any shifts recently?","Michael Kneeland","I wouldn\u2019t say shift. Our pipeline is always been full. Our business development teams have been very active creating a lot of communication relationships across the broad spectrum. But our pipeline is there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Nick Coppola","Bill, In your opening comments, you talk a bit about the cycle, but one if you could add any additional color there relate to customers were positive. It sounds like, what conversation looks like with customers and what is your visibility at this point?","William Plummer","Well, I think I articulated in my opening comments and we talked about the Dodge starts and talk about Dodge momentum. To look at, it's been up five for the last six months through the strongest result for us since late 2012 early 2013. The backlog, I think, is another way of looking at it. The backlog is a new peak at 14.1 months on the backlog versus 12.2, and those are the things that we look at that sees the visibility that goes forward. And by the way, we talked about Canada earlier -- even in Canada building permits were up non-res sequentially up 12%. So, we do see a lot of activity that is on horizon. Our customers overall as I mentioned in our opening comments are optimistic. They're seeing the same thing in the build-up of their backlogs.","Nick Coppola","And then just wanted to ask on Hurricane Matthew as well, how do you expect that impact your business in Q4 and then in the following quarter?","William Plummer","For those you to know me weather has not been one that won't be always hung our hat on. But unfortunately, there was a lot of devastation as I mentioned in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolina's. And our people have been there, it's not material for us simply because of our size. We're across all of the U.S. and Canada, and even if you look at what happen in during the Sandy Storm, it wasn\u2019t the material impact. It will take years to recover as they rebuild will say will do, and that will play out overtime.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please.","Joe O'Dea","First question is just on, on used equivalent pricing. i think when we look at the reported adjusted margin in the quarter, it was down a little bit sequentially and so maybe to talk about in any channel or next considerations there, but then more broadly just what's you are seeing on more apples-to-apples basis sequentially and how you feel about where things are trending in used equipment prices?","William Plummer","Hey, Joe, it's Bill. Don\u2019t think about it sequentially that all has the data from Q2 right here to give you a number I'd certainly on a year-over-year basis talked about the adjusted margin experience being up. If you look at the pricing underneath that margin experience on a year-over-year basis it's certainly down a little bit from last year let's call it 3% on a comparable unit basis maybe it touch 3% to 4% let's say on a year-over-year basis right. So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging now that we can still move the equipments through the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins at a pretty attractive level. If you look at pricing relative to the original equipment cost of the fleet that we sold in Q3, I do have that compare to Q2. It wasn\u2019t a significant change right on a sequential basis, price as a percent of OEC, that didn\u2019t change significantly Q2 to Q3. So that might give you a little bit of an indicator of those sequential experience that we had in the fleet. That helped","Joe O'Dea","Got it. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Sounds like stabilization sequentially, if you put it in those terms. And then just when we think about the outline you\u2019ve given on 2017 CapEx, 1.2 to 1.6 and I think you talked about how there been no firm decisions there, but could you talk about the planning process, and if where you are in that, when that really hits up. I think some of the tone of your comments today and feeling a little bit more positive about things, it suggests that we see some improvement year-over-year in that but how do you think about that when you will have a firm decision on it and where you are in the planning process?","William Plummer","So, I characterize this as being midstream in the planning process. As we said right here and now we\u2019re targeting a presentation of our plan to the Board in December, at least a preliminary presentation and so we\u2019ve got to be finish by then. Right here now as we think about next year. We haven\u2019t put us take in the ground, but our view will certainly be impacted by our view of how well the cycle is developing. And also impacted by our view of how well we\u2019re going to perform and continuing to win major projects and when just general business, go forward. We\u2019re looking at initiatives that they\u2019re going to have impact in 2017 some of which we will talk about at our Investor Day in December.","And those initiatives the overall cycle and how effective we expected to be are going to determine the end number. What I would say about the range is the range still live of that 2 billion to 6 billion. Yes, at this point, we could end up anywhere in that range. But keep in mind that if we are going to spend more going forward and we\u2019re spending right here now. We decided that we want to have a very clear view of where that spend is gone and how it\u2019s going to contribute to improving our performance as a company before we decide to spend that incremental amount, so more to come as we get closer to the end of the process and into January.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger","Good morning. I just, I have to ask the digital platform sounds pretty exciting and if you guys could rehash the quantification of the run rate now. What do you think longer term back and get up to I feel that could be a very significant percent of the mix and have you given any thought to SG&A savings on that yet? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","So Scott, this is Mike I\u2019ll start and then please Matt or Bill. Look, we think that as I pointed out in my opening comments, we\u2019re offering way and which our customers can easy to use place our own orders, manage their own business. And this is just a follow on from what we\u2019ve heard from customer overtime. I also believe which we\u2019re very happy to see that about half of that revenue is from new customers. So as we continue to increase the experience for our customers. We think that what we can grab more. Where it goes, I think that\u2019s yet to be determine. But the good thing is, we're on the front curve of that, and there are customers out there who want the simplicity, who want to be able to control, who want to be able to do those orders by themselves. And we want to make sure that experience is there for both of them. Importantly, for us, it's also the stickiness with our current customer base, and so to me, the adding into the new customers is just frosting on the cake. So Matt, Bill?","Matthew Flannery","No, I agree with Mike. The customer service aspect of it is primary, and I would say more than an SG&A play, this is more of the broadening your reach play just getting to more customers more new customers then you can get to just knocking on doors and calling on the upsides. And this is just moving into the future, and it's been received very well early days, and we're encourage by that, and hopefully this will open ups the new channels and broaden our reach.","William Plummer","Yes, I agree with that. We have not put an SG&A save number to this initiative as of yet, Scott and that's primarily because A; it's very early days. And B; it wasn\u2019t done for SG&A phase, right. It was done to satisfy those customer needs. As this scales and as we start to have a more visibility to the impact than it might have on SG&A, we'll attack the numbers as appropriate go forward. But we haven\u2019t done that as of yet because that's not where we're focused on this initiative.","Scott Schneeberger","Thank you, Bill. Could you discussed these potential ranges for EBITDA flow through in coming years unless you say based on a flat or rental revenue growth environment, obviously as you mentioned a few questions ago it looks like you are heading into that upcoming year?","William Plummer","Yes, the EBITDA flow through we've talked historically about sort of in that 60% area. I think that's still a reasonable range to think about as you have growth sort of significantly different than zero, right. If you are around zero growth, the flow through calculation gets very sensitive and that's quite obviously why we haven\u2019t talked about flow through extensively over the last few quarters. This quarter it was 76% or something like that, but obviously one EBITDA flows could it be lower when you are declining in revenue rather than higher so if that sensitivity of the calculation around zero growth that makes it hard to say much about the usefulness of flow through as a measure when you are around flat. Our plan for next year is to identify opportunities to drive growth. If we drive material growth next year, and I'll think it's ridiculous to think about 60% as a flow through that you could start your modeling with.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","Can you folks talk about the cadence of mix as we head into the fourth quarter and early part of 2017, you got to believe a fleet mix benefit that you called out in the EBITDA bridge, and I'm just wondering as we overlay our pricing assumptions anything we should keep in mind as you folks continue the specialty products, should we look for a mixed tailwind, to help offset whatever fleet inflation we dial in to our numbers for next year?","William Plummer","Tough one Jerry, and there is so many things going on in that mix line, that it's hard to give you much guidance on how to model it going forward. We\u2019ve got the growth in specialty. We\u2019ve got the Canadian versus U.S. mix effect. We\u2019ve got care class mix and so forth, the mix of day, week and month. So I\u2019m going to dig off of giving you much guidance there because it\u2019s just still so complex. And just ask you to be patient with this as we play out the next several quarters, and ask you to earn your money and forecast to make on your own.","Jerry Revich","I appreciate that. And in terms of whether you folks or obviously that ones to look at whether, but other companies are so what we\u2019ve heard is third quarter projects effectively got delayed from whether chance of the Midwest. Is that what\u2019s driving some of the pick-up in the acceleration business on year-over-year basis that you\u2019re seeing in October. So whether better projects are starting to get done, is that playing into what you\u2019re saying in the fourth quarter, what the stronger pick-up in utilization compared to normal seasonality?","William Plummer","No Jerry, I wouldn\u2019t really see that\u2019s been a major factor have been delays on some jobs, but I wouldn\u2019t delays whether, I delayed some supply chain and maybe other issues. But the good news is the demand is strong and it\u2019s carried well into October here which is good for us. And just to add, I know the mix answer your more mathematically, but I would say it\u2019s a good opportunity to remind everybody effect strategically we\u2019re still very committed to growing high return project specialty and cross-selling those projects not only for revenue reasons, but also for service reasons to our customers. The more solutions we can provide for them, we just feel that makes us a better partner for them, I\u2019ll take that mix opportunity to promote that strategic view.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session in today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator. And listen everybody; I hope you please feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, Head of our IR here in Stamford at any time to answer any additional questions, to see any of our sites, to get any kind of a tour. I hope you will listen and\/or attend our Analyst Day in December 1st as well. So look forward to seeing you all there.

","Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer. ","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Well thanks, operator, and welcome and good morning everyone. Now I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. So let\u2019s get started with 2014. It was a great year for us and [we\u2019ve got] another strong year in 2015. Our message today is about progress, discipline and consistency. These fourth quarter calls tend to frame the year-end as a hard stop, but in reality our performance is a continuum and that's especially true this year, when we went into 2015 with so much momentum. Now I\u2019ll talk about it in a minute, but first I want to give you the last 12 months that are due, because we turned in some outstanding results. ","Our rates were up 4.5% in line with our guidance. 2014 was the fourth straight year we moved the rates higher and we still see opportunity for improvement. We had record time utilization of 68.8% for the full year. And our return on invested capital was also a record of 8.8%. Together, they helped drive more than $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA on a rental revenue growth that outpaced the industry growth by nearly two-to-one. And our free cash flow was a homerun for the year. This was due in part to the used equipment margin of 48.5%, another indication of the ongoing recovery. ","And we set 1.7 billion on fleet and as you saw last night, our CapEx plan for 2015 is approximately the same with even higher expectations for free cash flow. Not only do we meet or beat every target in our outlook, we did it while making fundamental improvements the way we operate. Take safety for an example. In 2014, we had the fewest number of recordable injuries in our history. And we drove our full year recordable rate down below 1.0 for the first time. It was a 9th consecutive year of safety improvement for us. So clearly it\u2019s not just a fluke, it\u2019s a progressive exchange for the better in our culture. ","Specialty rentals was another great story. We grew our specialty segment very effectively last year with a disciplined mix of [NA] cold starts, new fleet and cross selling. Our full year revenue gain in specialty which includes the acquisition of National Pump in April was approximately 83% and a gross margin of almost 51%. That's nearly 400 basis points higher than the prior year and our fourth quarter margin for specialty was up nearly 500 basis points. Company wide, all but one of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth for the quarter with more than half of the region showing double-digit growth. ","And we had a very solid increase in key account revenue up [16%] year-over-year. National accounts which is a subset of our key accounts grew more than 18%, so from every perspective a very strong year. We demanded a lot of ourselves in 2014, and I am happy to say that we outperformed our own expectations. Now let\u2019s talk about this year. I'm going to start by acknowledging the concern that's out there about the effect of oil prices on our industry. ","Look, we're not running this business with rose-colored glasses and we don\u2019t plan to be caught by surprise. We\u2019ve dug deep into this issue and while we haven\u2019t seen any significant attrition to date, we do expect some impact as rig counts come down. Now we're constantly pulling the field, not just to measure upstream oil activity, but also to gauge any knock-on effect. And we\u2019ve done a lot of detailed analysis based on conservative assumptions to identify our exposure. And Bill is going to share some of those numbers with you in a moment. But I can tell you where they came out. Yes, we think oil prices will reduce demand for certain types of equipment in a handful of areas. ","But we disagree very strongly with the idea that our growth is at risk and I\u2019ll give you five good reasons why we feel this way. First, upstream oil and gas accounts for only 6% of our business company wide. That's a very modest exposure given our fleet can be utilized for other types of customers. Even in the battlefield states or a state like Texas, we\u2019ve got deep customer relationships outside of oil. Currently more than 80% of our rental revenue in Texas comes from infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, commercial building and a host of other industries. ","Second, we\u2019ve strong systems in place for fleet management, including the relocation and the repurposing of CapEx through used sales. And if circumstances change dramatically, we\u2019ve the flexibility to reduce our CapEx spend for the year. We\u2019ve done this before when warranted and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Third, we believe that any drag on demand for upstream oil will be mitigated by the positive effect on other industries. Take chemical manufacturing, one of our key sectors. When oil prices decline, manufacturing costs drop, production is stimulated and consumer purchasing power increases. ","The current growth rate of the US chemical industry is forecast to accelerate to at least 2016. This is just one of many examples. Fourth, the geography plays to our advantage. Our upstream oil exposure touches just a fraction of our footprint in any meaningful way. Now keep in mind, we serve 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces. That gives us a lot of room to deploy our assets. The reality is the [field] has been asking us for significantly more CapEx than we spend for a few years now. And we\u2019ve been very disciplined in reining in that number. ","So if we decide to move fleet due to localized weakness, we\u2019ve branches that are eager to take it. And fifth, we know how to outperform our end markets as well as our industry. We\u2019ve shown you that for years. In 2014, our 15% rental revenue growth was more than three times the year-over-year growth in non-res construction in November, thanks in part to secular penetration. And it was nearly twice the revenue growth of our industry overall. Not only is there still a lot of runway ahead in the industry up cycle, the macro economy is also trending in our favor. ","Many economists predict the US GDP growth will be in a range of 3 to 3.3% for 2015 with lower unemployment, more consumer spending on goods and services and a return to housing starts. And to the degree that any uncertainty still remains in our end markets, that actually works in our favor because we offer an alternative to large capital outlays. So when Global Insight forecast nearly 8% rental industry growth for North America in 2015 and with more growth to follow in 2016, which they did on Sunday you can take that as a starting point. But be assured we\u2019ve bigger plans. ","Bottom line, this recovery has already its share of bumps, and we think oil prices will be another bump. Given our scale and diversification we do not see this as a road block. In fact, we think the bigger picture is that low oil prices could have a significant upside for us over time. And more immediately, we will keep moving forward in a better than expected fourth-quarter by making disciplined investment to capture profitable business. I\u2019ve already mentioned that our specialty group is on a fast track. Power and HVAC in particular turned in a standout performance with 27% same-store growth and a 61% increase in revenue overall in 2014. ","For 2015 we\u2019ve earmarked a $170 million or about 30% of our [gross] rental CapEx to meet the increasing demand of our specialty fleet. And we plan to open at least 16 new branches, this includes cold starts for all of our specialty lines, power and HVAC, trench safety, pumps and tools. Our growth in specialty also reflects cross-selling to our broader operations where we're seeing good diversity in large projects. For example, our central US districts are predicting a big year with the wide range of projects underway or with the start dates in the next few months. ","This includes healthcare, education, hydropower, renewables, bioresearch and transportation to name a few. Further west, we\u2019ve got equipment on mega sites like [LAS] and a queue of major project work lined up. In the southeast are our mixed use developments, sports arenas, theme parks and airports. And in the [northeast] our customers in the high-growth verticals are hungry to stamp up any fleet that comes available, and that's typical to many of our regions. ","I hope I have given you a substantial insight into our thinking on 2015. Our outlook is positive because the facts support it. If we like what we see, we like what we hear from our customers then every indication is that the equipment rental is going to look at a multi-year up cycle with an ongoing recovery in our end markets and a tailwind from secular penetration. But we're also agile and we are well prepared to respond to any changes in our operating environment. We plan to spend $1.7 billion in rental CapEx this year, because we believe the demand is there. ","And we can adjust that number either way and regarding to at least $6 billion of revenue and approximately $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, because we believe that we can hit these marks. We\u2019ve done the math and we are already moving forward on our goals. So now Bill will cover the financial results and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So over to you, Bill. ","Bill Plummer","Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll move through the financial results pretty quickly, so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook which we wanted to make sure that we get. I\u2019ll start with revenue. Rental Revenue was a pretty strong quarter for us as Mike mentioned. Total rental revenue increased 16.5%, that's a $187 million year-over-year in the quarter. And as usual I\u2019ll bridge that 187 number. Re-rent and Ancillary continue to be nice contributors to revenue growth for us. Re-rent and Ancillary combined were up 26 million year-over-year. ","But the real driver is Owned Equipment Rental Revenue growth. That was up 16.3% for the quarter or a $161 million year-over-year. Here are the components of that 161. Rental rate up 4.1%, as you saw drives about $40 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. Volume was up 10.7% and that drove a $106 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. And that obviously includes the impact of National Pump fleet being added to the volume calculation. Our inflation on the fleet was a headwind. It was 18 million detracting from the year-over-year change and then the [rest], we\u2019ll call it mix and other including FX was a positive 33 million. ","Within that 33 million, in addition to the volume that Pump brought along, Pump operates at a higher dollar utilization. So they had a positive impact on mix of about $28 million within the 33. And then I would also call out the effect of FX in the quarter was pretty significant as a headwind, about $10 million of FX detraction from our year-over-year revenue performance. The other components were a sum of a whole bunch of other nips and naps in the year-over-year performance. So those were the key drivers of our revenue performance in the quarter. For rental revenue, I would also point out that we had a very robust used equipment sales result for the quarter. ","Used was up 16% over last year and as importantly, the margin was also very good, 48.7% adjusted gross margin on our used equipment sales in the quarter. Certainly helped by our continued focus on driving as much as we can through our retail channel along with the overall market price environment continues to be pretty solid in the fourth quarter. We also just touched on and had a very good new equipment sales quarter with robust growth in new equipment. ","On profitability, I\u2019ll bridge the EBITDA performance year-over-year for us. We had a company record for fourth quarter of $775 million of adjusted EBITDA and likewise it was a company record, 49.6% margin in the quarter. So that was a $124 million of increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 100 basis point improvement in our margin over fourth quarter of 13. Here are the components of the $124 million year-over-year improvement. The rental rate improvement that I mentioned earlier for revenue drops through the EBITDA at $39 million. That's just using a 95% flow through on the rental rate revenue dollars. ","Volume contributed $74 million worth of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. And then we had a couple of other positives here. Ancillary, re-rent I mentioned along with some other small pieces contributed about $16 million. Used equipment sales, I mentioned the improvement in volume and margin there. That contributed about $14 million of improvement and then a pump, the Cat.Class of pumps because of their mixed contribution contributed about $15 million worth of positive mix impact. Working against those positives, we had fleet inflation. That was about an $11 million headwind. ","Additional incentive comp, we've very strong incentive comp year and quarter and our adjustment to the incentive comp there cost us about $10 million over the prior year. That debt expense cost us about $8 million. We had a strong bad debt expense result in the fourth quarter of 13. We\u2019ve more normalized result in 14 along with a larger AR balance. So that's the driver there for that $8 million headwind. Merit increases were about $6 million and all other was the remaining one. So those are the components of our adjusted EBITDA change for year-over-year. If you look down at EPS, we had an adjusted EPS of $2.19 for the quarter, up very nicely from $1.59 the prior year. So overall a very, very strong profit picture for the quarter as Mike mentioned. ","Real quickly on cash flow, we had a great free cash flow performance in the quarter as well. $557 million of free cash flow the way we calculated, but I\u2019ll remind everyone that that includes merger-related cash payments of about $17 million in the quarter. So the way we look at free cash flow in the quarter or excuse me, this is full year. The way we look at free cash flow for the full year is a $574 million result. The real driver there and it did come in stronger than we expected. The real driver was better EBITDA performance along with really, really strong collections. We\u2019ve mentioned that before, but our AR collections have been coming in very strong for the last number of months now and that was a big part of the betterment there in free cash flow. ","Just real briefly to touch on our share repurchase program. We\u2019ve been repurchasing shares. We mentioned that we brought back about a $102 million of shares under the new $750 million authorization in the month of December. We add to that in the month of January. To date in January, we spent an extra $125 million. So we're now at $227 million of repurchases against that $750 million repurchase authorization. So that's the latest update for share repurchase. ","Also as Mike mentioned, I\u2019ll just reiterate. We had a very nice improvement in our return on invested capital, 8.8% for the full year. And that's a 130 basis point improvement over the prior year with the fourth quarter sequentially improving by 40 basis points. So we feel very good about the return direction that we\u2019ve the company pointed at. Now let\u2019s talk about oil. As Michael mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of work assessing possible impacts from low oil prices. And we\u2019ve done it in a variety of different ways. We keep coming up with the same conclusion which is that, we think any reasonable expectation for impact is manageable. ","Here is one way that we have taken a look at it, we think will resonate with folks. If we look at every branch in our company that has oil and gas revenue, we decided that the best way to look at this was to model that oil and gas revenue taking a significant hit. So in this case, we said any branch that had oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue. The upstream portion of their revenue stream, let\u2019s assume it takes a 35% hit. In addition for any branch that has more than a de minimis amount of oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue. ","Let\u2019s also assume that everything else, all of their other revenue take a 15% hit. So they get hit 35 in oil and gas upstream, they get hit 15 for everything else. If you do that and add it up across our company, the aggregate amount of fleet that would be freed up by those kinds of impacts would total about $400 million of average annual fleet. So 400 million, you know relative to an $8 billion plus fleet, you could you know say hey, let\u2019s dismiss that. That's not significant, but we don\u2019t think about it that way. $400 million is certainly a good amount of fleet to move around. Then we further ask ourselves, what could it mean financially? ","And we made some assumptions, so the 400 million is the average annual fleet. Will that kind of an impact happen over the full year? We said no. Let\u2019s just evaluate having that impact build over the year and say it\u2019s fully in effect at the second half. So the second half is really where that hit would apply. So that 400 million annual impact really in calendar 2015 would only have the effect of about 200 million on a full-year basis. We ask ourselves, how much of that kind of a downside could we absorb, could we mitigate? ","And while many of us could argue that we could absorb all of that kind of a hit, we decided to be a conservative in our downside analysis and assume we could only mitigate half of that. So the 200 million annual rate, we cut down to about a $100 million annual impact that represented real exposure to our company. How much of that $100 million of fleet worth, we assumed a dollar utilization on that. That was very high relative to the rest of our company. We used 60% in our analysis, so 60% is at least 5% percentage points higher than the dollar utilizations that we reasonably could expect in the second half for even the highest performing regions in our company. ","So 60% on that $100 million annual impact gives you a $60 million revenue impact and [indiscernible] through at 60% EBITDA, it\u2019s about a $36 million EBITDA impact. So when you look at it in that light, it doesn\u2019t scare you, right. It\u2019s not the end of the world to say, there is a $36 million [holed up] that, we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to fill. And as we said, we think that the options are fairly conservative. The good news as Mike mentioned in his comments is that we\u2019ve a sense that there is going to be robust demand in other areas outside of oil and gas. ","And other product types that we think can help address even if this what we\u2019ve believe is a [indiscernible] downside plays out. So that\u2019s the way we're thinking about the risk from oil gas and if you add the $36 million impact that we just walked through to or to subtract that from what we expect for the full year, we still feel like we can deliver the range of adjusted EBITDA that we\u2019ve given in our guidance. Speaking of our guidance for 2015, just to reiterate the key points you have already seen, we expect total revenue in the range of 6 to 6.2 billion. Within that rental revenue will be driven by rates at about 3.5% for year and time utilization of about 69% or twenty basis points improved over the last year. ","The adjusted EBITDA range of 2.95 to 3.05, again we feel is a range that represents the most likely outcome for the year. We do expect to spend about a 1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx and have that net down to about 1.2 billion for the year. And free cash flow will be a very robust result for us this year, somewhere between 7.25 and 7.75 is what we expect. Obviously that's significantly higher than the about 600 number that we guided to back in our Investor Day in December. And it really reflects the re-enactment of bonus depreciation for calendar 14, that Congress and President Obama signed just recently. ","So put it all together and it looks like a very robust year for us. We wouldn\u2019t say that, if we didn\u2019t believe that and believe that we had the ability to manage to that, oil and gas certainly is an exposure for us, but it's an opportunity as well. And we're going to look to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents as we always have. And if we can do that, we feel like we\u2019ll be having a good conversation at this time next year. ","So with that, that ends our prepared comments and we can open up the call for questions and answers. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question, please? ","Ted Grace","I was hoping to ask on 2015 margins. You know I know you give revenue guidance, you give EBITDA guidance. And so we can back into kind of what\u2019s implied on the margin in an incremental basis. But you know Bill, maybe if you could walk through qualitatively some of the key headwinds or tailwinds, we should just think about influencing where we might come out on that range. So you know things like mix, fuel costs, incentive comp, Lean, inflation, just to help kind of give us some guideposts? ","Bill Plummer","Sure. So I\u2019ll start, but certainly Michael, please, please chime in. As we think about top line, you know a couple of things that swirl in the background in our thinking. Obviously walk through our oil and gas risk assessment, but you know the question is, did we get it right? Could it be worse than that? Conversely, could it be better than that? So those are the things that surround oil and gas performance, but that may buy us the revenue one way or another. And I\u2019ll leave you to make your own judgment about you know how much risk you think there is. ","FX is another factor that we certainly need to be aware of. Yeah, the Canadian dollar has been weakening pretty consistently. Average Canadian was down last year by about you know 6 to 7%. And right now as we said, if it flat lined from where it fits right now at about $0.81, that would be another 6% or so year-over-year headwind from the currency going down. So that's a nontrivial amount of revenue that could -- that could erode. The guidance we gave is total revenue. So you\u2019ve to be mindful of used and new as well. ","And our plan for used equipment sales this year is a reduction over what we achieved in 2014. You know just looking at the difference between gross CapEx and net rental CapEx, you know we're guiding to something like $500 million of used sales proceeds. That compares to 549 this year or in 14. So that will be a little bit of you know an impact to the revenues and maybe keeps the revenue guidance from being higher than it is. And then you know there are other items that might impact at the adjusted EBITDA lines. So for example, we had a very robust incentive compensation this year. ","And when we [reach] the incentive comp targets for 2015, our [base line] plan assumes that we hit target and only pay out at target. We paid out you know nicely above target this year. So you know that will impact in a positive way, where we might end up on the adjusted EBITDA line. And a host of other issues, you mentioned Lean. The Lean initiatives are still rolling out and building momentum. You know we finished the quarter, still a little bit of [indiscernible] under here. We finished the year at an annualized run rate of about $30 million of Lean impact. That's up from the 23 that we reported at the end of the third quarter. ","So that's another you know factor that's playing through our expectations for 2015. So I\u2019ll start there and again, Mike I don\u2019t know if you guys want to say anything or if I've have forgotten anything, please jump in. ","Matt Flannery","Well, I think you captured it Bill. It\u2019s important to note the difference in used sales is really about what has reached the [indiscernible] in the year. And we don\u2019t have as much fleet that we have [indiscernible], so that's our, why we're guiding lower there. If retail opportunities go over and above that, you know or well we may swing, but I think it\u2019s a good target based on what we want to move out to keep our fleet fresh and to the targets we set, yeah. ","Michael Kneeland","Yeah, I would only add that you know everything that Bill and Matt said is spot on. I think that if you look at the projections of the industry at 8% for North America, is a little bit higher than what we experienced or what they projected in \u2018014. So could there be some you know on rate, could it be opportunities. It could be, I don\u2019t know to really, we somewhat tempered it you know as we went into the oil, but that could be an upside for us going forward. ","Bill Plummer","Well one other point Ted is that you know, I know where you are going, right. You are looking at the midpoints of revenue and EBITDA, and saying hey flow through there and comes out at you know pretty high level, 68 plus percent. That's you know an artifact of the fact that we're using ranges and the fact that the flow through calculation is very sensitive. If we were asked point blank, we would still say that we think about flow through for 2015 being something like 60% with [indiscernible] toward the upside because of the net effect of all of the things that I mentioned earlier. ","So if you're modeling I would say, you know get your revenue where you want it, at 60% and then maybe put your thumb up to be a little bit higher you know to reflect some of the net benefits that we expect to accrue over the course of the year. ","Ted Grace","That's super helpful. The only follow up I would have is, any willingness to quantify kind of what Lean expectations are? I now you exhibited a run rate of 30, you're targeting a 100+ through the program over a few years. But any sense, could you just calibrate us in what a tailwind might look like this year? ","Matt Flannery","Well you could do the trends, the math, Ted. You could do the trends. I mean we would expect it to follow that trend, right. So we\u2019ve said external targets, I mean internal targets above that 14. We put even extra emphasis on it this year, but I feel very comfortable that we're, we will keep at steady pace towards that $100 million by the end of 16. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Jordan from Jefferies. Your question please? ","Justin Jordan","I just wanted to talk about the nice problem of having extra free cash flow and what that might mean in terms of changes or the board\u2019s thinking about the capital allocation in calendar 15. Because obviously, relative to the guidance you gave on December 4th, essentially you\u2019ve increased free cash flow guidance by you know 25% overnight. Now I appreciate there\u2019s a tax implication here that's not really, you know that much of a percentage again. But is that changing how you think about potential specialty M&A? Is that changing how you think about you leveraging or potentially changing how you think about the amount of stock repurchasing you might do in 15? ","Michael Kneeland","Yes. No, that is -- ","Justin Jordan","You might like to give a bit more [color] on that. ","Michael Kneeland","No, you get one question. I think what we\u2019ve done with M&A is that we're always looking at M&A opportunities. And I'm flipping, but I don't think it changes how we think about M&A. If we found the right M&A opportunity, then we would go ahead and do that, whether we were at you know 600 or 700 or 775 of free cash flow. So M&A wouldn't change. I think it is fair to say that, you know as we look at the share repurchase program, if you got more cash flow and you want to pass the leverage and you know we\u2019ve already said, we expect to be towards the low end of the leverage range that you know that we want to operate in by the end of this year. ","Right, we\u2019ve called 2.6 as the leverage ratio we expect before the increase in free cash flow. So I think we would be more inclined to say okay let's not go crazy and go below the 2.5 kind of leverage ratio this year now that we\u2019ve got more cash flow coming in. So that may change how we think about the timing of the share repurchase program. And I think that's a sensible way to think about it. So that's all still to be discussed and certainly we will talk about more, when we make more decisions. But I think M&A doesn't change, but everything else we kind of put in the mix and say okay, we got an extra $100 million. What do you want to do with it and we will make that call. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please? ","Seth Weber","I wanted to talk about your CapEx commentary, specifically you know the comments around flexibility around CapEx. And you know you kept the 1.7 billion gross number for the year. Should we think about cadence this year being similar to how it's been in the prior years of 60-65% in the first half? Or do you hold back some of the spending you know to wait and see how the markets evolve? That's my first question. ","And then kind of as add-on to that, I mean it sounds like your specialty as a percentage of growth capital is down. You know I think last year, it was something like, I don't know 270-280 something like that and now it's 170, I think you said. Is that reduction primarily focused on the Pump business or how should we think about you know your growth capital going towards the specialty category? Thanks. ","Matt Flannery","Sure, Seth. I will answer both questions. The first as far as the cadence, if we plan out to being similar to this year, you know that we have a really strong flexibility as far as we don't need to make a decision if we're going to ship until literally a week before it's going to ship. So the second quarter, by April I think we will get a very good feel of it, the second quarter is going to be more or less and it will all be demand driven. The first quarter is light already which is good for us and right now we are restricting the inflow of CapEx obviously in the markets that we think may have a little bit softening in demand in the back half of the year. ","So I really think we will get a better picture on how much we adjust from our norm. And I would call last year\u2019s cadence a new norm, depending on what the demand is and where we're getting our returns and where our customers need our services. So that's how we feel about the cadence. As far as the specialty, we spent, we plan on spending over 30% of our growth capital on specialty. You're talking about more of a gross number when you are referring to last year\u2019s number. And a lot of that was, I would say re-fleeting our Pump, right so we need that acquisition to grow. ","And fleeting up the many cold starts that we have done in our other specialty segments, these specifically power even the year before. So they were now ready to absorb scale. So we really pushed a lot into the cold starts over the last couple of years and we will do some more cold starts this year, but not at the scale that we did over the past few years. ","Seth Weber","Okay sorry, Matt. So my, was my math incorrect. I thought that your specialty last year represented, you know like half of the growth capital or something like that of the -- ","Michael Kneeland","This is Mike. You are closed down that number. The Matt\u2019s point, if you go back to \u2018013, we had a significant amount of our cold starts stop, that were in the later part of the fourth quarter. That a lot of that CapEx ran into 2014 and then the cold starts that we had through the course of the year, and then treating all of those as we went through the year. So in total numbers, it's down. You are right, but it hasn't changed our view on specialty. We do reserve the right on you know Pump to understand what impact upstream could or could not have as we go through our cost opportunities. ","And as I mentioned, we will do cold starts with Pump to broaden their reach. And that was one of the key aspects of the acquisition, was making sure that, if you recall 6% of their business was only in our commercial and industrial space. So we see that as a significant opportunity, so it's kind of more of a tempered look if we take a look at it. And as I also mentioned, if there is a need for more growth capital, we\u2019ve got it and we will do it. And flexibility is built into our model. ","Seth Weber","Okay and then Matt can you, have you seen anything, can you make any comments on used equipment pricing because I think that\u2019s something that people are increasingly you know nervous about? ","Matt Flannery","Well other than that [indiscernible], so we enjoyed a real robust fourth-quarter from a volume, a little bit more than we even expected in the month of December and with margins holding flat. So and flat at a very high level, so we are seeing still a robust used equipment market. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please? ","David Raso","Hi, on the oil downside scenario, I was just curious what percent of your entire fleet is captured on what you're considering you know at-risk territories? And then secondarily just trying to think through rental rates in that scenario, just trying to capture if you feel there is any potential knock-on effect to rates and territories where other equipment might be going into or you know essentially just even the rates pressure you may see in those weaker energy sensitive markets? ","Bill Plummer","So, I will tackle the rate one first. The 3.5, about 3.5 guidance that we gave is lower than where we were thinking about rates you know, call it a month ago or two months ago. And so in that sense you know we have included some conservatism to you know to a flat effect, that rate could be pressured as that oil and gas dynamic plays out. And yet we still say 3.5, could it be worse than that, obviously it could. But again, we think we have got opportunities to respond and manage it down. I don't remember off the top of my head, the first question of what percent of the fleet. ","Michael Kneeland","Well if you just do the math, right. So we said the 35% knock-on, I mean a 35% upstream would net in about 400 million. So it's over a billion, I would say it\u2019s somewhere in the billion and 1.2 billion, I don't have the number right handy in front of me. But I think that, well actually, it\u2019s probably 1.2 billion of fleet that we think will be impacted and those are markets that have oil and gas upstream business today. ","David Raso","Okay, I mean I maybe oversimplifying it. Because that's not everything in these states are driven by energy. But I'm just thinking about 29% of your branches and all branches aren\u2019t the same, I know that. But just going with the data we have, 29% of branches are in what I would consider nearly somewhat energy-sensitive states in the oil sands. And in your analysis, you're saying kind of roughly half of that\u2019s at risk, I guess right because 1.2 of the 8.44 billion of fleet is about 14%. Is that the right way to think of it roughly, half of the branches in those states in the oil sands is sort of at risk? I am just trying to understand the analysis. ","Bill Plummer","Yeah, it's hard to do the analysis based on branches in states and get anything useful in our opinion. That's why we went to the individual locations and tried to reason from what business they have that\u2019s exposed right here and now. So we didn\u2019t do it, to you know to go to great levels of detail on you know how much fleet that at, you know how many branches or in which states. We have that, I don't know that it's something we want to go through in great detail. But just the $400 million impact, I think really it does capture a pretty good view of what the exposure might be. ","But if you don't believe it, okay make it a $500 million impact. Let's say we are off by 25% or even a $600 million impact and say we're off by 50%. You know, the end result doesn't change dramatically, right. It\u2019s a still a 35-40-45-$50 million kind of risk, even with conservative assumptions about how far down it goes and how much we can mitigate. I like our chances with that kind of risk scenario.","David Raso","Yeah, no I appreciate. I think the issue is, is there more territory at risk than solely branches that happen to have upstream oil and gas in that region? I mean you know it's just, it's obviously just a debate right now about contagion beyond just those direct areas? And also on the rates, I mean you have done a great job this cycle on saying that, well we're not going to throw capital off the fleet just to grow. We're going to focus on better returns. ","Should I expect if, you know if I'm thinking maybe a little more cautiously about the impact in broader contagion, you are going hold the rate before you try to hold utilization? I mean if I had the model from downside sensitivity, should I be taking it more down on utilization, you would argue or taking down on rates. I'm just trying to get a feel for philosophically if things got weaker than your forecast thing? ","Matt Flannery","It will depend right on what the demand is and what we are seeing. But I would say that we are going to have utilization at the levels that it needs to be at because we can do, we can manage that. We can manage how much fleet we put into the market and how much fleet we remove out of the market. So I think we will be very diligent on those rates in time, but time is much more easily manageable. And I think as Bill stated, we built in a little conservatism on the rate because moving the fleet from higher rate areas and you grow fleet into areas that aren\u2019t your top 10% is going to have some knock-on, whether it's a quarter point or half a point, I don't think we really know yet. But I think we captured it in our guidance. ","Michael Kneeland","And I guess I will [indiscernible] in that then, as we feel that utilization is coming under some pressure, while you want to hold the rate, it might play with it a bit. But the key is, you also have the outlet [indiscernible]. I mean I guess that's the idea. If used prices hold up, you can manage utilization also by just simply shedding some fleet. And I think that's a key issue of used prices. If they hold up, you can do that relatively profitably, but that's you know obviously a part of the debate. So we should think of let\u2019s just trying to move the fleet, you also can tap you know the retail market the best you can on selling used. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital. ","Joe Box","I got a question on your construction pipeline on slide 13. And I just want to tie that together maybe with your methodology on guidance. So how should we be thinking about the $370 billion pipeline and how you incorporate that into your guidance? And then maybe just you know to take it one step further, what are your guys on the ground telling you for some of these you know energy sensitive projects that have already started or maybe are just a few months away from breaking ground? Are they concerned about this, or are they you know thinking everything kind of moves forward as planned? ","Matt Flannery","So this is Matt, Joe. So we do have some key account managers that specifically just call on oil and gas. So obviously they are hearing the most noise about whether it\u2019s future concerns or some job cancellations. But even in that space, the pipeline was so robust that individually they may have opportunities. I think more importantly the other 90% of our key accounts managers are extremely encouraged. Because we\u2019ve always sent the fleet to the highest return opportunity and oil and gas was pretty hot for a while. You could argue we may have underserved a lot of other opportunities that will give us very good returns and a little bit more geographically diverse. ","So I think that, what we are hearing on the ground is encouragement and opportunity in markets like the West Coast, even the Northwest, the Southeast, the mid-Atlantic where you could see the map that we have on the investor deck and I think it was slide 14, where you see there\u2019s some real opportunities. So that's what we're hearing, that's why we feel very strong about our guidance, our customers have the demand and our boots on the ground are seeing it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please? ","Scott Schneeberger","I will follow up on Joe's question. On slide 14 that is, it's a nice add. It says construction overall, is that non-res construction, could you specify. And then could you speak to the end markets in those six or seven states where you see the double-digit growth? Thanks. ","Matt Flannery","So would you want to know about the verticals that are or where the opportunities are in those states or just the specific states? ","Scott Schneeberger","No, you would see the states on slide 14. The vertical opportunities in those states and what type of construction specifically? ","Matt Flannery","So I think Mike covered a little bit of it in his opening remarks. When I say it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s broad. I mean there is multiple stadiums, multiple car plant expansions, manufacturing. I say the single largest vertical would probably be chemical. Chemical plants have shown robust growth. Even in the state of Texas, right, we talk a lot about the contagion impact in Texas. We have a very large portion of our business in Texas that's chemical related. And that's forecast to be 26% growth in Texas. ","So we think that there is many verticals that are positive and places that we are going to serve in 2015. And it is that broad base, just why I am not, I mean chemical stands out. It's just how much growth there is, which is why I'm not holding in on the other vertical because it's very broad. ","Scott Schneeberger","Okay thanks. Just following up on that, how much of that is forecasted and how much of that do you feel is in hand at this point of the year? Thanks. ","Matt Flannery","So I don't have place in front of me right now, but you could think about it as the pipeline through the seasons of the year. And certainly there is less dark right now, although our time [indiscernible] remain very strong. I would say by mid-summer you're going to see at least half of that pipeline materialize in rental opportunity. So and then it's just a matter of how quick things move from it and that's standard with the construction cycle that we have been experiencing throughout my career. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please? ","Joe O'Dea","A question just on the potential risk of accelerated fleet growth across the industry with, you know what is a pretty strong backdrop. And really, you know your ability to monitor what your competitors are doing and if there is any particular competitor segment, whether that's by region or size of competitor, that you think would be the largest risk to maybe over accelerating fleet growth and adding some rental rate price pressure? ","Bill Plummer","So yeah, I\u2019ll start. You know the ability to monitor is pretty good, right. We're everywhere and we touch I won\u2019t say every customer, but a lot of the market. And so we\u2019ve got real time intelligence on what our competitors are doing. And we feel we\u2019ve the ability to respond if we think responding is appropriate. And that's one of the advantages of being who we are. In terms of you know what competitor might be most at risk. I won\u2019t name names here, I\u2019ll leave you to make your own judgment about that. All we can say is that United Rentals is going to be very conscious about any [CapEx] decision, whether it\u2019s to increase or decrease. And it\u2019s going to be driven by what we\u2019ve taken in from the market. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. ","Jerry Revich","Can you gentlemen talk about what you are hearing from your refining customers? I think there was one of RSC\u2019s bigger industrial end markets if I remember their disclosure is right. We\u2019ve seen them you know cut back in CapEx, but I think their equipment spend more on the maintenance side of every day type work. Is that right, can you just give us an update for that end market? ","Matt Flannery","Certainly, so we\u2019ve heard of some CapEx cutbacks and I would say probably more severe in the oil sands than anywhere else. And there have been a couple of projects in the Gulf that have cancelled. But I would say overall, that pipeline is still robust and you are accurate. The large amount of onsite relationships that we acquired during the merger with RSC really, really gives us a strong base to work from. We're not seeing any slowdown of that maintenance at all. As a matter of fact, our industrial region is showing the highest time utilization we\u2019ve in the company right now, and the highest year-over-year growth. ","So and they are primarily on-sites and what I would call a downstream oil and gas and chemical plants. And we're just seeing a real strong growth there and I don\u2019t think the maintenance is going to take a hit here. I think it\u2019s mostly capital spend, which if we really wanted to be rosy, you could say there\u2019s an opportunity there for us to get more penetration as capital continues to get cut from some of the end markets. ","Bill Plummer","Yeah just, I was going to just say, also on our slide, you know our customer confidence index, you know reaching. We only, only of the 170 key accounts that we reached out to, only 1% saw a slower growth in 2015. We spent an awful lot of time in preparation for this call, reaching out to our customers, reaching out to our employees. You know I know more about oil in the last two weeks than my 35 years in the industry. And you know I would tell you that, you know we haven\u2019t seen any significant impact, talking to our customers, steel erectors. ","Steel erectors and you take a look at our book of business and bidding. Not one of the projects I saw had any relationship to oil at all. And it was, they would say it\u2019s a record opportunity and year for them coming up on their bidding requirements. So you know that along with Jerry, the feedback that we're getting from ARA and the Global Insight, which by the way you know has been inside this industry for close to 7 years, maybe longer working with our industry, refining the nuances of their model on you know how this industry reacts to things. When they come out with 8%, you know we take that at the heart. And that's not soft, that's not easy, and we think that that's a good indication of where our industry is going. ","Jerry Revich","Thank you and Matt, just a clarification if you don't mind. The cancellations that you mentioned, was that ground up projects that you are referring to, or is that just brownfield type work? ","Matt Flannery","The ground up projects, and so there were a couple of plants. I mean the pipeline that we went through in our fourth quarter QBRs with our regions, we saw more projects start with a billion than I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years combined. And candidly, if half of those projects cut, I think it will be more robust pipeline than we had over the past few years as far as large projects. And we\u2019ve seen you know maybe 10% of those get cut off the table right now. Because of the concerns that everybody has, so they will hold up on some of these new construction, new capital projects. But and I still feel that the pipeline as Mike stated and we all stated is very robust and the Global Insight survey just kind of supports what we're hearing from our customers and from our boots on the ground. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. ","Steven Fisher","How would you guys describe your expectations for Canada overall in 2015 relative to the US? I know you just mentioned some oil sands, a weakness, but just Canada overall. And then how easy is it to reallocate equipment from Canada to the US or would you more envision reallocating amongst the provinces? Thank you. ","Michael Kneeland","I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Matt to tie in. But you know as part of the overview with ARA, they are looking at a little over a 3% growth for all of Canada. That combines with the 8.5% they are projecting for the US and it would give them just around 8%, 8.1% of growth for North America. I actually think that Eastern Canada, which you know by the way has been down over the last several years, we\u2019ll see some activity there, and you know come forward. The only headwind we would have as Bill mentioned is the currency exchange from our revenue, but in constant dollars we would expect that to grow. So we see that the Canadian market grow and then probably less growth on Western Canada than we have experienced in the past. ","Matt Flannery","Yeah, I would agree Mike. You know we\u2019ll just stay in the same currency right, because that's how I would manage those businesses and judge them. We\u2019ll see growth in both of those, in both Western and Eastern Canada regions next year. And like all of our regions, we do zero growth CapEx budget, so we're going to have to earn their growth as they stack ranked against their peers. And they fared pretty well in the past and I expect them to fare pretty well in the future, specifically Western Canada. ","Steven Fisher","And in terms of reallocating equipment between Canada and the US, is that something that you would envision doing and then how easy is that? ","Michael Kneeland","I think because we have, when you think about the 1.7 billion of new capital that we spend, you know that's 20% of [8.4] base, if we start with this year\u2019s base. We historically have been able to re-shift geographically by utilizing equipment sales and either not replacing in that market or not putting growth capital in that market. So we\u2019ve been able to geographically remix through that. If we had to put trucks under fleet we do that, and there are some intricacies of doing it from Western Canada. ","But if it was really dropping, that's not something that we would do. The cost are minimal compared to the opportunity you would have by reallocating. But right now, they are running high time utilization and we're just going to manage the influx into any of these oil and gas markets first. And I think that will prevent them from having to move fleet, but we can react very quickly, whether it\u2019s Canada or somewhere else to move the fleet. ","Operator","Thank you and our final question due to time constraints comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? ","Nicole DeBlase","So just, most of mine have been answered, but just you know one on utilization. So I was kind of surprising to see that you are guiding for [indiscernible] utilization in 15. Is that also conservatism around oil and gas risk, or are we kind of at the high water mark for utilization, the [cycle]? ","Bill Plummer","I wouldn\u2019t say we're at the high water mark. We still feel we\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to drive utilization. We\u2019ve talked in the past, you know of all three of us, probably reading that we can get into the 70s if the market holds and if we do the things that we think we can do. You know the 69% would be up 20 basis points, so I guess you could call that flat if you like. ","But that is tempered somewhat like the rate discussion, it\u2019s tempered somewhat by our concern about oil and gas and about, while we think we could mitigate, we don\u2019t know that we will be able to mitigate 100% of any oil and gas quite often. And so we backed off a little than where we were a month or two ago when I talk about 2015. But we still think that\u2019s a very robust performance on utilization and Matt\u2019s comments earlier, you know utilization is something that we certainly have a lot to leverage that we can use, right. If it\u2019s falling down, you can\u2019t sell more or you can buy less and as for as the business you do have over [indiscernible] fleet. So you know we think that we can pull all the appropriate levers and deliver that about 59%. And we think that's, you know that's on the way towards better utilization over the next several years. ","Nicole DeBlase","Okay thanks, Bill, that's really helpful. And then just for my follow-up, I am taking about 1Q, you know as far as what you guys have seen so far quarter to date, shall we expect to see like normal seasonality this quarter? ","Michael Kneeland","Yeah, I would say so. We're experiencing very similar metrics that we did till last year when you look at the rate in time utilization, maybe up [ahead] in time for a couple of weeks. But it\u2019s early, I think it will fall right in line with our usual cadence. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. ","Michael Kneeland","Well thanks, operator. I hope we\u2019ve gone some distance in bringing clarity to what we see as favorable operating environment in 2015. "],"21196":["United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael Kneeland - CEO","William Plummer - CFO","Matt Flannery - COO","Analysts","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research","Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Steven Fisher - UBS","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to the United Rentals Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Investor Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.","A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the company's earnings release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.unitedrentals.com. Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.","You should also note that the company's earnings release, investor presentation and today's call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us in the call this afternoon. I want to start the dialogue today with one word, deliver. Yesterday you saw us report a fourth quarter that more than delivered on expectations, it was a strong end to a record year. But to us delivering is more about looking forward, it's about delivering again in the months ahead. So today we'll connect a momentum we created over the past twelve months with our positive outlook for 2018.","So looking at the fourth quarter, the most prevalent tailwind was market demand; we leveraged this with two significant acquisitions and a flexible CapEx strategy. As a result our revenue growth in the quarter outperformed the market and that's on a pro forma basis which assumes we owned our acquisitions from 2016 forward. Not only did we grow rental revenue by 11.5% in the quarter, we improved all three underlying metrics; volume was up 8.8% year-over-year and rates improved 2%, time utilization was a solid 70%, up 100 basis points for the quarter. This put up for your time utilization to over 69% which is a new record for us.","Three months ago I made the observation that the industry background are made to become more constructive and that was clear in December when every one of our regions reported positive year-over-year rates for the first time in years. Our rates are a key driver of growth in returns and are continuing to be a major focus for us in 2018, and it's been a while since we've seen this window of opportunity and I can promise you we won't rest. And here is another point; almost every metric in a fourth quarter performance compares favorably to the full year. Rental revenue for the year was up 7.6% versus 11.5% for the quarter. The quarter outpaced the year on volume, rates and utilization as well. So yes, we delivered on 2017 but more to the point or poised to build on that in 2018.","Now Bill will review our guidance but I want to take a minute to comment on the free cash flow line. Like most companies we're working through the estimated impacts of the U.S. tax reform. We anticipate a meaningful benefit to free cash flow, our Board is considering the potential uses of the extra cash but no decisions have been made yet. That being said we have many options available and we're always very disciplined about our capital allocations. Any decisions we make will be consistent with our focus on balancing growth and returns to maximize long-term value.","Premise of our 2018 guidance; strong operating environment. Now frame two questions that cover the basics; first, well our core business and our specialty segment continue to see solid demand in 2018. And second, will this demand be driven by a healthy rental cycle without relying on natural disasters, legislation or other events. In our opinion, the answer to both these questions is yes. Our core general rental business is performing extremely well, commercial construction remains robust and we're seeing continued strength in rig infrastructure which has been a strategic focus of ours for more than a year. In fact, our revenue growth in this vertical has been outpacing market growth.","Our infrastructure contracts run the gamut from airport renovations in New York and New Jersey to roads and bridges in Texas, and a pipeline work in the central region. States and municipalities are finding the money to make critical infrastructure repairs, and if Washington comes up with funding for public works that money will benefit future years. In other verticals a large number of energy related projects has been at present supplies, it's encouraging to see oil prices stabilize in the 60's and corporate construction is going strong; this includes large corporate campuses and data centers. There is over $4 billion of data center construction scheduled for Virginia D.C. area alone, and tax reform encourage more corporate spending possibly as early as 2019. More immediately, there are signs of that plant turnarounds could ramp up later this year and this should benefit -- would benefit our industrial business.","Internally, all of our region submitted market outlooks that are bullish on 2018. Perhaps the most important is the customer sentiment is positive and on the rise; almost 66% of our customers surveyed in December described their outlook is improving. This was the strongest reading in almost four years and in fact, the quarter as a whole showed sizeable gains in customer confidence, both sequentially and year-over-year. In Western Canada which has been an economic outlier our team reports that customer sentiment is positive for the first time in three years.","Turning to our specialty segment; our trench, power and pumps operations gave significant ground in the fourth quarter. As reported, segment rental revenue was up almost 39% year-over-year primarily on same-store basis. The gross rental margin increased 230 basis points to 47.5% for the segment. The plan for this year is to open at least 18 specialty branches and continue to grow this very successful arm of our strategy; and this follows the 16 cold starts that we opened last year. So that's a backdrop for 2018, a number of promising dynamics underscored by broad-based demand in a healthy cycle. And this is consistent with virtually every key indicator for our industry.","By given the level of customer activity we've earmarked up to $1.95 billion of gross rental CapEx this year; and as we consistently demonstrated to our investors we maintain a high standard for the use of capital and we'll be keeping a close eye on market trends and we're not -- we won't hesitate to adjust our CapEx up or down, if necessary.","Another tailwind for us in 2018 will be the added capacity we brought on board last year. Our acquisition of NES [ph] last April gave us greater density on the East Coast, Gulf and Midwest, and further entrenched our brand as an aerial supplier. With NES, we gained a strategic position in earthmoving with almost a 40% increase in dirt equipment. Our general rent segment has been able to sell more effectively the vertical such as infrastructure and disaster recovery with this fleet. And in addition, we expanded our specialty offering with smaller acquisitions focused on power equipment and site services.","Our larger organization stands the benefit for every growth initiative we take going forward. For example, we're making significant investments in the future of customer service to innovation. Our digital technology is one enhanced the way we gain and retain customers and manage change. One major development we have underway is a single digital platform to integrate all of our customer facing technologies; this includes online ordering, account management, GPS analytics, use of equipment sales, [indiscernible] sales, total control asset management, and our United Academy training portal. We're also leveraging the data we harvest in areas like telematics and so one of the many ways we help our customers become more productive in their use of equipment.","And that's just as important as that you understand why we're making these investments. Today more than ever customer service is a moving target, the spaces we operate are constantly evolving, it's critical that we give customers multiple ways to work with us and we must anticipate the needs for tomorrow's job sites. The investments we're making are intended to deliver tangible business benefits over the long-term. So as you can see 2017 was one step forward after another, it was our busiest year but it was also our safest year on record. Our total recordable incident rate for 2017 was just 0.78 making it the fourth year in a row our rate was below 1; and this speaks to the caliber of our people and our culture.","You may have noticed that culture is getting a lot of attention lately in the business world. Lots of us talk about what it takes to achieve employee engagement and sustainability, and other attributes of good corporate citizenship. Well, I'm proud to say these are all part of our core values. United Rentals has a long history as a purpose driven company, our employees are personally invested in our vision. The last quarter I spoke about our United Compassion Fund which is the way our employees help each other. We also support the National Association of Women in Construction and we've been advocating for military veterans for over a decade lending our support to numerous causes. And just recently, we were ranked number 7 in the nation as a top military friendly employer across all industries.","Years ago when we first made culture a priority we decided that the best way to create sustainable value was to bring together the interest of our investors, our customers and our employees as one cohesive company and as a result all stakeholders are well served by our success; that's how we delivered a record year in 2017, now it's our time to do it again.","So with that I'll ask Bill to cover the quarter and recap the year and then we'll take your questions. So over to you Bill.","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everybody. We've got a lot of topics to go over in this quarter, so I may send out some of the normal commentary we do but please if I skip over anything of interest raise it in Q&A.","Michael gave a lot of the pro forma's for the full year performance, so most of my comments will be focused on as reported data, I'll call out the pro forma's where I think it adds to the understanding. I'll start with the rental revenue as always; a $1.646 billion was the rental revenue in the quarter, that's up 27% or $348 million versus last year. The breakdown started with the ancillary and re-rent, those two combined were up $51 million year-over-year. Ancillary was the big driver and that reflected primarily the volume of delivery fuel and Rental Protection Program revenue that we had from the addition of NES and NAF. Certainly, we continue to drive delivery realization as well in the base business; those were the main drivers of that 51 increase between those two items.","OER was the remainder; within OER volume was up $322 million reflecting the nearly 29% growth in OEC on rent that Mike called out our rate was $12 million contributor as well year-over-year as positive rate of 1.1% in the quarter on as reported basis. The pro forma rate realization in the quarter is 2% and that's certainly is encouraging as we go into 2018. Replacement CapEx inflation, we call $17 million reflecting our normal inflation and mix and other was a headwind of about $20 million in the quarter as well; so the net of all of those added together gives you the $348 million change on rental revenue in the quarter.","Quickly moving to used equipment sales; another good quarter for us in the used equipment with $172 million in proceeds, that's up $37 million versus last year or 27% increase. The adjusted gross margin on that revenue was at 57.6% and that's an 8 percentage point improvement over the prior year. Key drivers there, we talked in the past about improving the realization against fair market value and our used equipment sales is one of the project excel initiatives; so that continue to contribute in the current quarter, as well though that the overall market was strong, pricing in the market was strong with pricing as indicated by our proceeds as a percent of OEC coming in at 53.6%, that's up 20 basis points over last year. And I'll remind you that's on very old units that we're selling which we sold units at an average age of about 91 months in the quarter.","To give you another view of pricing and our used experience; if you just look at our retail sales on used equipment and compare like-for-like units that sold this year versus last year, the pricing on like-for-like units in our retail channel was up about 5% over last year. So again, a good market for used equipment pricing and the demand for volume is still robust so we're able to sell everything that we need to sell.","Moving to adjusted EBITDA; $947 million in the quarter, that was up $198 million over last year or about a 26% increase. And the margin on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 49.3%, that improved by about 10 basis points over last year. The components in the bridge of that $198 million increase volume was $216 million contributor on the growth that we talked about, rental rates at EBITDA contributed about $12 million of year-over-year improvement, the ancillary performance I mention contributed about $23 million of EBITDA the used sales performance was another $33 million of positive year-over-year contribution. The headwinds, fee inflation; we'll call that $13 million of headwind versus last year, our usual merit increase of about $6 million and then the bonus accrual across all of the incentive comp programs cost us about $26 million versus last year.","Mix and other accounts for the other $41 million of headwind and really that mix in other number is a little bigger than normal driven by the fact that we added Neff in the quarter, right, Neff revenue came in fully loaded with all of the costs of Neff as opposed to incremental cost for the other increases in revenue. So put it all together and it explains the $198 million increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. The follow-through on adjusted EBITDA was 49.6% in the quarter; I'll remind you that that experienced the headwind of incentive comp adjustment, that $26 million I called out previously; if you take that out the flow through was about 56% for the quarter.","Just a touch on Neff a little bit more; we estimate that Neff total revenues in the quarter came in at about $115 million of which about $96 million was rental revenue in the quarter. The EBITDA contribution for Neff we're calling $62 million and that includes the impact of about $3 million in synergies that we realized in the fourth quarter from the Neff acquisition. In fact on the synergy front of that $3 million, the bulk of it came late in the quarter in December; if you annualized what we experienced in synergies, these are pure costs synergies mind you, if you annualize that December result we're at a run rate savings of about $25 million of Neff related synergies. So we're well on our way towards the $35 million cost energy that we called out when we did the Neff acquisition and we certainly expect to deliver that before the end of year two as we called out initially.","We're also on-track to deliver the procurement savings and it's still early days on all of the revenue synergies that we expect but we certainly haven't seen anything that causes us to believe we won't be able to deliver on all of the synergy targets when we acquired Neff.","Moving quickly to adjusted EPS; you saw the numbers in the press release, $11.37 for the quarter, I remind you that if that includes the benefit of tax reform we had a positive tax adjustment, I'll touch on it in a minute but if you take out that tax reform aided benefit which was about $8.03 in the quarter you end up with $3.34 on an adjusted after-tax reform basis, that's up 20% versus last year which was $2.67. If you do the same adjustment for the full year you end with an adjusted EPS after the tax benefit of about $10.59 and that's up just over 18% over the prior year. So even taking out the impact of tax reform it's very clear that our EPS performance is nicely higher.","Free cash flow in the quarter; just briefly on that, $983 million for the year that includes however $76 million worth of payments that we made for merger related and restructuring items. If you take that $76 million out obviously that leaves $907 million which is still a very robust free cash flow performance in. So we're very pleased about the free cash flow that we generated in '17 and look forward to an even more robust free cash flow performance in '18.","I'll skip a lot of the discussion I usually go through on the debt activity in the interest of time but certainly we discussed the actions in our debt portfolio in the press release, redemptions, upsizing ABO, upsizing AR facility, all of that in the quarter made for a very active quarter but the net effect was that we ended the quarter with net debt of $9.1 billion, that's up about $1 billion. Year end was very strong, $1.7 billion of total liquidity made up about $1.3 billion in ABL capacity and the remainder in cash within the business.","Briefly on the share repurchase program; you saw that we reinitiated our share repurchase activity in Q4, we bought about $28 million worth of shares, that's a little over 167,000 shares in the quarter and certainly left us with about $345 million to repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization at the end of the year. Since the end of the year I'll note that we have also bought another $45 million, so or so during the month of January to-date -- so as we sit today there is about $300 million left on the existing program and as we've said before, we expect to execute the remainder of that program during the course of 2018.","On ROIC just real briefly, we finished the year with ROIC of 8.8% that's a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year. And just to give you a sense of the impact of tax reform on ROIC, it will be significant. So if the 21% federal tax rate had been in effect for all of 2017 that 8.8% ROIC would have come out at 10.7% as calculated; so obviously a very significant impact based on the way that we calculate ROIC looking back over the prior four quarters. As we go forward through 2018 the effect of that tax reform change will gradually increase our ROIC as reported, so in the quarters coming we'll be sure to call out both the actual calculation but also the calculation assuming that the 21% federal rate had been in effect for the full period.","Briefly on tax reform; I want to try not to get too deep into this one but just want to make sure that several things are clear. First in the impact on 2017, there was a significant tax benefit that our deferred tax liability for the new lower tax rate, that rival adjustment was about $746 million. Separately we also recognized $57 million of additional transition tax to cover the transaction payment associated with our foreign earnings, the net of those two was what you saw flowing through our fourth quarter tax line. If you take those out of our fourth quarter tax expense the full year effective tax [Technical Difficulty] to the investor deck where we added another example of a project XL initiative and how we think about the value that it's contributing, this one focused on our sales optimization effort that involves assigning more single point responsibility for key accounts.","Finally guidance; you saw the guidance that we issued in the press release -- I won't go through all the numbers but maybe it would be helpful to talk about the adjusted EBITDA guidance and give you a framework for thinking about the range that we put out. If you look at -- let's use the midpoint of that adjusted EBITDA guidance, so 36.75; and look at the components that lead you to that midpoint from our 2017 actual experience. We call it this way, the addition of any S&F for the periods that we didn't know last year would add about $180 million worth of EBITDA just from the businesses as we bought them last year; so assuming no growth they would add about $180 million in 2018.","The other acquisitions would add another roughly $10 million or so to get us to a new baseline for the acquired businesses. If on top of that you added synergies for any S&F which combined or about $50 million, call it $20 million NES, $30 million for Neff, you get another $50 million on top. Our bonus reset will be a tailwind for us in 2018, it will be about $30 million less expense than we had in '17 so added $30 million on top of that. Our used equipment sales will go up a little bit in 2018, so in our net rental CapEx guidance we called out an impact of about $600 million of used equipment proceeds in 2018. If you take a 50% margin, apply to that just as a rough estimate that adds another $25 million year-over-year.","And for the remainder, if you just assumed a simple 6% rental revenue growth at a 60% flow-through -- all of those assumptions take you right to the midpoint of our guidance range. Whether we do 6% rental revenue growth or more or less we'll leave to your own imagination as analysts but we wanted to frame the guidance range that we gave for adjusted EBITDA in a way that lets you see the broad impacts of some of the specific items and gets you in the neighborhood of what we think the year will look like.","Finally, just a comment on free cash flow and capital allocation; there is a lot of interest and what are we going to do with all this cash flow; we're guiding to $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of free cash flow as the range for 2018. I think it's fair to say that as we look at the possible uses of that cash flow our mindset for how to make decisions about capital allocations has not changed. We still want to make sure first and foremost that the leverage of our business is appropriate for where we are in the cycle, we believe the answer to that is yes. Then we want to make sure that we're making the right decision about the amount of organic growth to put it in the business through CapEx is appropriate, we believe the range that we've given you for CapEx is very appropriate in the market environment we expect.","M&A is always part of our thinking about uses for cash flow and we certainly will be ready to do acquisitions that makes sense but they need to make sense, we've been very disciplined about that. And finally share repurchase, we've talked about completing the existing program $300 million remaining as we sit today; whether and how much more we might do beyond that is the subject of a discussion that we'll continue to have with the board as we go forward throughout the course of the year. If we deliver the guidance that we talked about here, we should finish the year with our leverage ratio of something like 2.2 times at the end of the year, that would be very low versus the range that we've historically talked about it 2.5 to 3.5 times. So we'll have a very active discussion throughout the year about where we allocate the use of this cash flow and what level of leverage we think is appropriate for where we are in the cycle.","Like I said, a lot of topics, so let me stop there but if there is anything that I missed please raise it in Q&A. So Operator, can we open the call for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","I just want to kick-off with the free cash question just Bill as you were going through those details; but look at -- your guidance right now, your EBITDA and free cash conversion looks like it's 35% to 40% at least for 2018 but looking further out is there any reason that you can't hold that level of conversion for the next several years because if EBITDA continues to grow you're presumably kicking off $1.5 billion for year on consensus numbers for the foreseeable future. So I just wanted to get your reaction to that thought process? Is there any reason why that cash conversion should really change materially in the next couple of years?","Michael Kneeland","Ross I'd say that there is nothing really unusual other than the impact of tax reform, nothing else unusual driving our free cash realization. So I think that story might be told by the impact of tax reform. Remember that the 100% depreciation under tax reform goes away after five years, so at some point that benefit is going to be reduced. Remember also that they placed caps on the amount -- the percentage of EBITDA that you need to be below in order to still deduct interest expense, we are below that cap currently but that cap changes from a percent of EBITDA to a percent of EBIT at some point in the next few years. And depending on where we are in our profitability and our leverage it may have an impact as well but those are the things that I think over the future years -- the unusual things that might impact the cash conversion outside of just our normal operating performance.","Ross Gilardi","Just on the supply demand balance for rental equipment; if the market was excessively tight after the hurricanes, do you feel like we've come back into balance as you've pulled forward some CapEx and clearly it's the seasonally softer time of the year but do you feel like price momentum has got subside in the first half of '18 -- more when you get into the spring months as you pulled forward some your CapEx?","Matt Flannery","I wouldn't say that there has been an extraordinary tightness due to the hurricanes, maybe in a few markets but we felt all year demand was -- that the combination of demand and the disciplined supply of the industry really played into the dynamic of great opportunity and better time utilization; and we see that continuing and we're forecasting that to continue throughout 2018. As far as -- we maybe a little bit lighter on the cadence of our 2018 CapEx growth; so we might bring in a little bit less than normal in Q1 just because we brought more in Q4 than we usually would but other than that no real impact on our full year thoughts about CapEx where we get back to more normal cadence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","I had two questions if I may. The first is just on dirt as a relative attractiveness; I mean there is a lot of signs with the used equipment etcetera that the dirt is maybe tight. I don't think there is any structural improvement there and obviously if you've mixed the fleet that direction with the acquisition. And then second, all the stuff from both maybe you can just respond as you choose. I love that total control chart that you've got in the slide deck. I mean can you give anecdotes around this; it would appear that you're steadily, steadily growing that base; I don't know if you're losing anybody who has installed or if there's a really good lock-in on it and what people are seeing in terms of benefits and savings as I guess as well as you guys?","Matt Flannery","As far as the great observation on the total control value we feel very strongly about it and fortunately the customer response seems to feel strong as well; so that is organic growth and it's as you could see a couple of points higher than what our overall growth is. And I think that's important because although it's not a huge percentage of our customer base they're usually large important strategic customers and we go through that extra effort to add value to them and they do outpace our overall growth. As far as the dirt attractiveness, obviously we like the impact of the Neff acquisition, not just the talent we brought in or the fleet mix but I think the biggest opportunity are the customers that we brought with that. So adding a larger mix of dirt gives an opportunity to serve maybe a broader customer base than we had previously. The net-net impact in dirt fleet, it went from 12% of our overall fleet profile last year to 14% this year and although that is an impact, the bigger impact is the access to those customer bases, especially in key verticals like infrastructure which we're very bullish on.","Rob Wertheimer","So can we expect you to continue to invest a little bit in following along with the dirt side?","Matt Flannery","Absolutely, especially as the demand continues and we already were to be clear set aside from the Neff acquisitions; the Neff acquisition just gave us a real boost specifically in the larger end of the dirt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","First question; you referenced the industrial side of the business. Could you talk about what portion of your revenues are really made up of the industrial side and then what you've seen over the past couple of years whether that's more stabilization or whether that's kind of moving off of a bottom and just trying to appreciate what kind of recovery we could see there?","William Plummer","So just the aggregate industrial have to pull a number together but the key areas for us as we think about growth going forward, chemical processing certainly is an attractive growth area for us. The manufacturing might be a little slower this year, metals and mining and minerals we think could be a nice growth area for us as we go forward as well. And then power pulp, paper and wood products will probably contribute as we go forward as well. Oil and gas, if you want to call that industrial has been a growth area for us, upstream activity had a nice growth in 2017 given the impact of oil pricing and drilling activity, the upstream part of that will be a growth area for us.","Midstream and downstream will depend on -- quite honestly on the timing of some of the turnarounds in the refinery complex, that timing is always a little bit of a wild card for us but certainly we have reason to be somewhat optimistic that that will be a growth area for us as well. So hopefully that's useful.","Michael Kneeland","I would just add additionally that the capital spending forecast for what is the largest part of our industrial business is petrochem are both positive for 2018 and 2019; so we're encouraged about that as well.","Joe O'Dea","Michael, you're occasionally asked about interest in expanding internationally; I think you usually address that is something down the road but certainly don't eliminate the possibility. And when you think about the kind of cash that you're looking at generating over the next few years, does that in any way influence how you think about the timing of potentially -- expanding some of your growth to overseas?","Michael Kneeland","The fact that we've had the capital available to us, not only coming into this year in 2018 but we've had it for quite some time. It really to me is going to be predicated on our customers, the customer demand and wanting us to go beyond. We talked about total control, there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies that we are engaged with and using our digital front. And that may be the impetus to get us beyond North America but there is no footrace and as Bill mentioned about acquisitions, they will be what they will be and they would be under the same scrutiny that we've always gone through it. But still plenty of opportunity in North America but we never say never and when the time is right or the customer is prepared, we'll be prepared to go what them.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso. Your line is open.","David Raso","I'm just trying to think about the commitment you've usually had to 2.5 to 3.5 leverage. I mean, Bill you've been there for 10 years and every single year you've been there the company has never ended the year below two and a half net debt to EBITDA. And if you look at logical thought of where you're EBITDA is at '19 -- I mean your net debt to EBITDA is usually down like one-eight. I mean you're literally talking about $2.5 billion to $3 billion to put to work; are we still committed to where I shouldn't expect to not end below $2.5 billion net to EBITDA either of those two years? I mean at this level you could -- the next 24 months buyback over 15% of the stock. I'm just trying to understand are we still committed to something that you've always done, you've never ended a year since they hired in '08, below 2.5 net debt to EBITDA.","William Plummer","David, I think -- I don't -- I can't get too far out on this discussion because honestly I can't get that far ahead of our board but I think we've made a compelling case in the past that 2.5, 3.5 is a good range; we have always said that we're not afraid to go a little above that for the right deal or a little below that depending on where we are in the cycle. So it's not like gets a religiously set number to say 2.5 is the absolute lowest. That said, if it were Bill Plummer's world, 1.8 is too low, right; I believe we selected that 2.5 to 3.5 range because it represents our view of a good balance between efficiency of the capital structure and management of the risk against the cycle, right. Getting much, much below 2.5 starts to become more inefficient and you don't get much in terms of protection against the downturn.","So that would be the argument I would make to the board but the board has their perspective on this issue right, and so going through that and discussing it and coming together on a point of view is what the process is that we're going to go through to decide where we end up in terms of the leverage. And it's going to be live and up by the fact that there may be deals that come along or the market strength may indicate that we need to spend more on capital as we go along. So I'd say stay tuned is the way to think about it but certainly we're very pleased to be in a position where we can think about all these things at very large scale.","David Raso","So as you said in the Bill Plummer world, this Slide 20, 2.5 to 3.5 is still the way to think about the company and you're not going to deviate off of that for too long and you've not heard anything from the board to suggest they want to delever the company beyond this framework; is that a fair assessment for now?","William Plummer","I think the fair assessment is to say we don't live in Bill Plummer world. So at least not Bill Plummer world alone; so I'd just point you to stay tuned David and we'll talk about it as we develop that thought process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger. Your line is open.","Michael Kneeland","Scott, you're on mute or operator are we have any difficulties?","Operator","No. Please standby. Mr. Schneeberger your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Mike, I was curious in your comments about plant turnarounds later this year; it's kind of something that people have been waiting for -- I'm just curious if you could delve into that a little bit more and is that something that you're expecting and perhaps in guidance or is that something that's -- that would be an upside? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Scott, there is a lot of positive industrial macro indicators that are out there, number one. And I'm not going to list them all because I think you know who they all are but they are uniformly positive, number one. Number two, just looking at some of the other resources \u2013 IR [ph], they are looking at the value of maintenance projects and capital projects as increasing; so we take those along with what we get back from their regions and our customers -- what they have on their books and what they're seeing. So we take all that to frame up our comments.","Scott Schneeberger","And then I'm curious on the progress report on online rental systems; just -- it's been a couple of years now and wondering how far have all decided [ph] and where that's going to go? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","As far as where it is today we feel very confident and about the capabilities we've built, the customer adoption we know is going to be a longer cycle; so it's not a big piece of our revenue right now and it's a pretty good mix of new customers versus existing customers. What we truly believe and why we've invested in this area is this is going to be the price of entry in the future, and not just for new customers but we think a lot of our existing customers will break more and more technology; so we view this as a must have long-term which is why we made the investment and we're seeing good early signs of the people that are adopting it, it's still a small percentage of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry [ph]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Pricing was stronger than normal seasonality for you folks; in the fourth quarter I'm wondering if you can talk about how broad-based was -- it was the pricing strength versus normal seasonality and can you give us some context in terms of feedback you're hearing from the marketplace into January?","Matt Flannery","I think you can look to Slide 7, we actually give you a three-year sequential pricing grid there if you want to get into the detail later but you're correct, it was better than 2016, we're very encouraged by that. I think it plays off of the demand that we've been discussing on the call today and really throughout the calendar year '17 and we expect that to continue. If you want to delay over or carryover, so -- and we're going to talk about rate pro forma because we think that's the important way to think about it and it's the way we manage internally. We've got a 1.65 carryover going into 2018 -- pro forma. If you overlay the exact experience of sequential rate performance that we had in 2017 over that that would get you to about a 2% year-over-year rate improvement pro forma for '18.","So we feel that's a good anchoring point; all I would say is that we haven't had a Q4 in a while where every single region had positive sequential performance and we're very pleased with that. Even Canada got to almost flat year-over-year in Q4 which is great for that team that's been fighting headwinds for a few years now.","Unidentified Analyst","And Matt, it sounds like that momentum is continuing in the early part of the year based on your comments just now and earlier in the call, is that a fair assessment?","Matt Flannery","I would say it's as projected, we're not giving in quarter guidance but Q1 always has -- it will be your toughest sequential but it's the year-over-year that we're focused on and trying to maintain that momentum and you know, that's embedded in our conversation, stay tuned for April, you'll get the exact update.","Unidentified Analyst","And on your digital platform, can you talk about what kind of recurring business you're getting out of it? So is it truly transactional one-off new client signing up or what do the usage statistics look like for you on that presumably? With your footprint you folks are better positioned than most in that platform and I'm wondering if you're seeing the level of statistics on the recurring business that are supportive or is it mostly transactional?","Matt Flannery","So as far as recurring, as I stated to Scott it's about 50-50; existing account customers and new customers joining in and they overtime convert to account customers but it is very broad geographically, product mix and even duration of rental. I would -- it's certainly a higher percentage of transactional than our overall base business because we have such a large base of key account business but I'm very surprised by how much recurring business and long-term rentals we're getting through that as a percentage as well.","Michael Kneeland","The only thing I would add to that is, the digital era is here and it's going to grow overtime. And if you take a look at the total control, order entry for our customers and even internally for -- whether it be our sales force, the digital component is going to grow. What we've been doing is we've put everything under one unified platform so everything comes together in a more customer-friendly environment; so it's not only -- like I said in my opening comments, it's not just a digital -- if they want used equipment, if they want to go into safety training, rent equipment -- find information on their fleet through telematics, this is all coming together under one uniform platform that we have built and we're rolling out. There will be more to come and more update as we make progress but it's an investment that we're making for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher. Your question please.","Steven Fisher","Just talk a little bit more about what's driving the shift to positive pricing year-over-year? How much of that is mix including the oil or activity or recovery versus just general tightness for all the across the market versus some of the analytics approaches that you've been doing or anything else?","Matt Flannery","Steve, it has been very broad, it is not any one segment, any one geography, any one vertical. Although we have had oil and gas growth to put in perspective it's still less than 5%; the upstream is still less than 5% of our overall revenue and I don't think it has -- certainly hasn't yet and I don't truly think that will ever get to the rate levels that it had previously, right; we're not going to have that oil rush in upstream again. I think everybody understands including the operator -- that wasn't a healthy way to operate and I don't see that recurring. So it's really been lifted by just -- by broad-based demand and as I mentioned, every region in the company had sequential positive rates in Q4.","Michael Kneeland","I would say that it's also as you know -- the industry is overall is reacting positively; so I think I've mentioned this in several calls in the past that our industry is becoming more sophisticated and smarter, and knows about returns and so that's a good sign and I think you'll probably hear others as well talk about it.","Steven Fisher","And then if I could just follow-up on a question that Joe O'Dea asked earlier; if you could talk a little bit more about the process industry activity in the Gulf Coast, specifically in 2017 versus 2016? How did that look on a year-over-year basis for rental? And then I know you mentioned there's a number of petrochemical projects that you see in the works out there -- what have you embedded in your guidance for sort of the timing of all that happening and Gulf Coast '18 versus '17?","Matt Flannery","So specifically in the Gulf Coast I would call the first half of '17 was a little bit tougher than the back half; we actually saw improvement in Q4 in petrochem. I think going forward more importantly the capital spending forecast are up in both, higher in chemical, I mean we're talking about plus 30% capital project spending in chemical and almost double-digit in refining and those are really the two big buckets of business that we focused on in the Gulf Coast industrial business. So I think it's -- we can call it flattish to slightly up overall in '17 over '16 but encouraged and planning to do better in '18.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer.","Rob Wertheimer","I just wanted to ask a philosophical question on investment in technology. I mean do you view this is something that you keep spending as a constant percentage of sales? As you're seeing -- I mean your scale is obviously growing a lot with the acquisitions and the growth we're doing. And so you keep spending and see a widening gap versus folks or do you accelerate it maybe because it just enhances the sustainable margin\/locking advantage you have versus folks or is there eventually scale on the technology spend that you've been ramping up for the past two or three years.","Michael Kneeland","Well, I think it will be a combination of all of the above. For example; the investment we made in telematics and now educating the end user on the benefits of what they can get out of it and making that information for them available in a format that they can get and manipulate as need be, that'd be one. With regards to companies trying to find ways to control their cost, drive better time utilization or efficiencies in their plants or on those job sites; that's another form by which we do. And then you know we talk about safety, our United Academy of making sure that we're connecting not only equipment but people as well, that I think is going to pay dividends for us as a company in entangling our customers in a way that I don't know what my competitors are doing but what we know is that you know the digital communication is important, it's real-time, is giving them data, it requires them just to log-on where -- I'd far as I know were one of the few if not the only that you can order deliver, return and never talk to anybody and for some people in programming their jobs that's very attractive. Not everyone has a staff. So we're trying to touch as broad audience as we can and we're specializing in areas like -- we talked about total control but there are benefits that we think that will yield us a lot more in the longer term.","We will continue to invest, the board is very supportive of thinking about digital and how we can think differently and helping our customers become more productive. That's what we do for a living, that's our job.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ramsay Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess I'm just thinking about your expansion plans for specialty for the next year and maybe even beyond; is the competition in this segment getting intense enough as more rental companies try to execute growth here. Is the competition making Greenfield expansion or bolt-on expansion harder or less attractive?","Michael Kneeland","This is always competition. I think it makes us smarter, makes us more customer-centric, makes us have to think about what we bring to a value proposition. I never assume anything and so we have to make sure that we're listening to the customer and making sure we're meeting that demand. Some of our competitors are doing some other similar things that we're doing. But it's up to us to sting out how we can make a smarter or better mousetrap to capture that customer. We're broad, we have a broad customer reach and how we can leverage our customer through our cross-sell I think is something that we are doing exceptionally well and we'll continue to leverage on that.","Matt Flannery","I would only at now certainly remains attractive and a prioritized focus for us in investment. We're going to do another 18 cold starts in specialty in 2018 and that's on top of the sixteen net we did this past year, so it still remains very tracked and I'll make sure that's clicker. But if the competition is getting stronger we're getting better because our growth rates are still pretty robust.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, as you can see we're excited about 2018, we expect to report solid progress in the coming quarters. In the meantime, as you -- you can always call Ted Grace, how is our Head of IR with any questions you may have and I urge you also to go on the website and download or look at our investor presentation that we have online. So that wraps up for today, so operator you can please end the call. Thank you.","Operator","Certainly, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today. Earlier this month we announced our exciting acquisition of BakerCorp. Today the news is about our strong financial results, our continued confidence in this cycle and our many avenues for profitable growth. You've heard us talk about organic expansion, fleet management and our sales and service initiatives. In short, we\u2019re leaving no stone unturned as we execute our strategy to balance growth and returns.","Before I get into the quarter, a quick word about Baker. This acquisition is a highly strategic move on our part, we feel even more strongly about that today having spent an additional two weeks with their team. So Matt will bring you up to date on Baker in a minute and we'll \u2013 I\u2019d be happy to address any questions during Q&A.","And just to be clear, any confusion that \u2013 about our revised guidance, it does not include Baker as we have not closed yet. Our guidance represents our expectations for a standalone business and in our press release we gave a projected impact of Baker for the balance of the year which you can add to guidance to help with your models.","Now let's talk about the second quarter. It was a robust performance all way around by our Gen Rents and Specialty segments. When you look at the results, pro forma for the acquisitions, you can see the strength of the metrics behind our double-digit increase in revenue. The big drivers are 7.1% increase in volume versus 2017, reflecting an acceleration from the first quarter and a 2.8% increase in rental rates.","Every one of our regions showed rates up year-over-year. While company-wide our performing time utilization was 69.2% tied last year's second quarter record.","There's a lot of demand out there and we\u2019re bringing all of our collective experience to bear in turning that demand into profitable growth. That's part of the reason why we are outperforming the marketplace. We are seeing not only the impact of a healthy cycle on our metrics, but also our experience in managing that opportunity.","We believe that we can get more rate without sacrificing utilization and we are focused on operating as efficiently as possible. Yesterday we raised our outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and CapEx spend three solid indications of our confidence in this cycle and our ability to deliver returns. We are looking at over $7.5 billion of revenue this year and we intend to make the most of that growth.","Another milestone in the quarter was the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program and the launch of the new $1.25 billion program we announced earlier. So we are on track there too. And operationally I couldn't be more proud of Team United. We just delivered our 16th straight quarter with a record \u2013 with a reportable rate at or below one and our safety record speaks volumes about the caliber of our people.","I'm talking about these things back to back to make a point. With us is not an either or when it comes our focus or the use of capital. In this case, we\u2019re being very strategic about M&A, reflecting our CapEx to meet demand and we\u2019re on track with our share raise program. And we\u2019re keeping our eye on the ball with best-in-class operations.","Matt will go into more detail, but before I hand it off, a final word on our end markets. You see the same leading indicators we do, virtually all of which are positive. We have the additional benefit of our customer surveys plus 15,000 employees with an ear to the ground. And from where we are standing, we see a healthy level of customer activity continuing to drive significant demand.","Our performance in the first six months of 2018 and in particular the second quarter has set the stage for a strong back half of the year. We are meeting that opportunity on the front lines with size, diversification and a more customer focused organization. And these are the pillars to sustainable growth.","Now I'd like to give it to Matt for his thoughts and then Bill will cover the numbers. So, over to you Matt.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks, Mike. First I'll start with Baker and I'll echo what Mike just said, we're very bullish on the acquisition. This deal is exactly what we\u2019re looking for in specialty and at a high level Baker and United both share the same space, but we each bring something different to the table.","Baker will open doors for us with their bundled solutions for fluid, storage, transfer, and treatment and it promotes two-way cross-selling across the customer base. At the same time, it builds up our current platform for Pump Solutions. And we get a small but complementary toehold in Europe. Now our team has a long history of successful integrations and we'll be using our playbook with Baker for another smooth transition.","Now I want to talk about the company as a whole. Mike hit the nail on its head with his comments about managing the opportunity and I'll give you some examples of just how broad-based that opportunity is. Our vertical markets are up across the board in construction and industrial versus 2017.","And one big proof point is our own performance. In the second quarter all of our regions were up in rental revenue year-over-year and that includes Western Canada, which was up over 12% in local currency, and nationally Canada was up almost 15%. In the U.S. conditions are particularly strong in the Gulf, the South and the Mid-Atlantic states. And this cycle stands out to me for its diversity of projects. In the South for example, we've got equipment on all kinds of projects from convention centers to stadiums data centers airports even a nuclear lab. And believe me that list goes on. And in the Gulf, we are seeing capital projects in petrochem start up in the back half of the year and most of these should carry out into 2019. And we talked about this timing on our call in April and now it's great to see it coming to fruition.","In the Midwest we've got wind energy projects underway and infrastructure is taking off. More broadly growth in infrastructure across our organization plays well into our focus on that vertical. Our acquisition of Neff last year added large equipment to our fleet and that's been helping us win in infrastructure. So what are we doing to capitalize on all this? We are managing the business with lot of discipline while continuing to make investments in long term growth. You can see that in our Specialty segment we've opened 13 cold starts so far this year and we'll add another 50 plus branches with the Baker acquisition.","Specialty is something that we feel sets us apart from the rest of the pack. In the second quarter rental revenue from our Trench Power and Pump segment was up almost 34% year-over-year. The bulk of that increase came from same store growth. This was driven in part by cross-selling. Our cross-selling revenue is up 28% through June versus last year. And we are keeping the field focused on branch to branch collaboration and cross selling is one of the big payoffs. It's a key lever for us in both return on assets and customer service.","Another major lever is CapEx. Back in January when we established our 2018 guidance we said that we wouldn't hesitate to adjust our CapEx up or down if necessary. Well yesterday you saw us respond to the high performance of our assets by increasing our CapEx guidance. And we're seven months into the year and we continue to see an exciting level of opportunity to put a larger fleet on rent.","Now I want to step back on the mechanics of our business and step towards the customer. Recently we finished training almost 14,000 United rental employees as part of initiative we call One UR [ph]. We started this back in January. The One UR is a platform we created to remind each and every employee that there are important link in the value chain from our customers. Customer service has always been core to our culture and now we are taking it to another level. We want to win our customers' hearts and minds.","So to engage our employees we held full day workshops with our frontline teams in every market to share best practices and explore new ways to improve our services. And when you When You Are is a great example of how we are making investments in our people. It's key to our strategy because customer service that's consistently head and shoulders above the rest earns us more business and more customer loyalty. It's a lever that's 100% within our control our people get that and they are fired up about it. So as you can see things have been busy around here. But we still stepped up and deliver the record financial performance.","I know Bill has a lot to cover so I'm going to ask him to pick it up from here and then we'll take your questions. Bill?","William Plummer","Thanks Matt. Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. Just to highlight the overall comment that I'll make here. The numbers I refer to are typically as reported numbers and to line up with what we file publicly in a few places if I refer to a pro forma number I'll call it out specifically.","So with that, let's get started with rental revenue, as we always do. You saw that the rental revenue result, it was $1.631 billion in the quarter and that's up $264 million over last year, a 19.3% as recorded. Really, a series of key drivers in that result, starting with ancillary revenue, up $30 million over last year.","And that's really driven by the higher delivery and fuel recoveries primarily, with the increased volume, part of which is the acquisition of Neff contributing in the quarter. So $30 million year-over-year from ancillary revenues. Re-rent was up another $7 million, again, given the volume and the demand we're seeing overall that drives the re-rent result.","Owned equipment revenue grew through the following drivers: volume, OEC on rent change contributed about $187 million in the quarter; rate was another $33 million with a 2.8% rate result that we realized. We had our normal replacement CapEx inflation in the quarter, about 1. 5% of revenue, call it $18 million of headwind in the year-over-year reconciliation.","And then, that leaves mix and everything else at a positive $25 million or 2.1% in the quarter. That's primarily driven by the shift in mix of our revenue, more towards our specialty regions, as Michael and Matt talked about, the very strong growth that we're seeing in specialty. So add them all up and you get to $264 million of improvement this year over last year.","That revenue performance, by the way, on a pro forma basis was an increase of 11.4% in rental revenue, which again reflects the strong external environment as well as our investment in growth in that environment.","Real quickly on used equipment sales. The second quarter delivered $157 million of used equipment revenue. That's up $24 million or 18% over last year. The adjusted gross margin result was 51.6% and that was down slightly from last year, primarily due to a change in mix of the equipment sold and a slight shift in the mix of channels that we sold through. It still represents a very strong used equipment market that we are selling into.","Our proceeds as a percent of the OEC, the original cost of the equipment that we sold was very strong in the quarter, 58.7%. And that's almost 5 percentage points higher than it was last year. If you look at it in terms of the realized price on a like for like unit basis of our retail sales in the quarter, our pricing was up almost 7% in the quarter. So a very strong used equipment market and we're executing well in that market overall.","Moving to adjusted EBITDA, $907 million, it was up $160 million over last year, about a 21% increase. And the margin in the quarter of 48% was up 120 basis points over last year. The key drivers in the bridge for that $160 million increase: volume, we're calling $125 million on the volume increase; rental rates call it $32 million over last year contribution; and the ancillary revenue that I talked about before, we're calling $15 million of improvement over last year.","The used sales result was up about $11 million last year \u2013 over last year and the fleet inflation translates into about a $14 million headwind against last year for that 1.5% or so of inflation impact that we normally expect.","We did have our normal merit increase and little bit of an increase in the bonus accrual. Those together are about a $7 million headwind. And everything else mix and all the others translates into about a $2 million headwind versus last year. Obviously with the positive revenue mix offset by still carrying the Neff fixed cost right we haven't anniversaried Neff yet as well as some incremental drag from the cost that we called out in the first quarter, which we will talk about a little bit more later.","So those are the key points of the adjusted EBITDA bridge from last year. It drove a \u2013 an EPS result that's very strong overall $3.85 in the quarter. That compares to 2.37 over last year. And while that's supported by the change in tax law and a lower tax rate it still represents a very robust growth.","So $0.70 of the 3.85 you could attribute to the change in tax rate but that still leaves a very robust increase over last year even excluding the tax rate impact. So that's the EPS story.","A few comments on our cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was very robust leading to a year-to-date free cash flow of $703 million. That's a $74 million improvement over the year-to-date period last year. I'll call out that that does exclude the impact of the \u2013 excuse me \u2013 that does include the impact of the merger related and restructuring payments if you exclude those, which is the basis for our guidance, the free cash flow story in the first half of the year was $719 million.","Key drivers of the year-over-year change in free cash flow are as you might expect the adjusted EBITDA improvement offset by the increase in net rental CapEx are the main drivers. And then puts and takes in the other lines of interest expense, cash taxes, working capital and everything else.","Directly addressing the rental CapEx story, we spent a total of $946 million in the quarter on gross rental capital that's an increase of $252 million over last year. That's pretty robust spend and it brought our year-to-date CapEx spend to 1.226 billion an increase of $313 million over last year.","That kind of increase in rental CapEx spend, the fact that we were flat on a time utilization basis year-over-year I think speaks to the strength of the demand that we\u2019re seeing and our ability to execute with that kind of growth in our fleet. It's a very robust environment and our folks are really putting this incremental fleet spend on rent at a very high rate.","Net rental CapEx when you exclude the impact of the used equipment sales was about $789 million in the quarter. And again that's robust increase from last year and supports the top-line growth that we deliver.","If you look at our net debt position as a result of that cash flow performance, we finished the quarter with $8.9 billion of net debt that's up from last year about $1 billion and obviously reflects the impact of the acquisitions that we've done since then, in particular the 1.3 billion or so that we paid for Neff in the fourth quarter of last year. Liquidity in the quarter finished at just over $2 billion with $1.9 billion of that coming from availability under the ABL facility and the rest cash balance of about $117 million.","Just quickly addressing returns for the quarter our ROIC in the quarter was 10% on a trailing 12 month basis and that's an improvement of 160 basis points over the prior year. Now since we used the actual tax rates that were in effect during the 12 month period when we calculate the ROIC it certainly had a significant impact. But if you assume that we have the current 21% federal tax rate in effect for all periods in that 12 month the ROIC would have calculated out at 10.9% and that would've been a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year. So however you look at it the return performance of the business is very, very strong.","On the share repurchase we spent $168 million in the quarter on share repurchases and that completed the execution of the $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We finished that up in the month of June and if you look back over the entire $1 billion authorization the average price that we purchased that average out to $85.60. And the total shares that we repurchased totaled 11.7 million shares. In the month of July, we started execution on the new $1.25 billion program that the Board authorized earlier this year. We spent $24 million so far against that program and we continue to expect to execute that program on a fairly steady basis to complete by the end of next year.","Couple of quick questions on the Neff comments on the Neff integration and Baker. The Neff integration is essentially complete and we've taken all of the major actions that we expect to take on Neff and continue to look at how we prepare ourselves to integrate the Baker acquisition. We expect Baker to close in the early part of this quarter let's call it the end of July just for the sake of discussion. And we expect that Baker will then start to contribute to our performance. You saw in the press release that we are looking for Baker to deliver around $140 million of revenue for the remainder of this year and call it $40 million of adjusted EBITDA in calendar 2018. We also expect to spend something like $50 million of incremental CapEx for the Baker acquisition by the time the year is out.","And again I'll just repeat what Michael said. Baker is not those numbers are not included in the guidance that we gave for the standalone United Rentals we'll incorporate that once we actually close the transaction. On guidance you all saw that we increased our guidance for most of the elements of guidance that we give. I won't go through the numbers again but we certainly did increase total revenue adjusted EBITDA and our gross and net CapEx expectations we did not increase the free cash flow expectation. $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion reflecting the net impact of increased CapEx offsetting the increases in cash from operations from the improved profitability.","So those are the key comments I wanted to make. Before I open it up for Q&A just let me offer one personal note. As you all have seen we announced that my retirement from United Rentals is coming up here over the course of the next several months. And this will be the last official earnings call that I do with you. Jessica Graziano will be in this seat making these comments at the next quarterly call in October.","I just wanted to say to all of you who has been with us over the last 10 years that I've been around, thank you. It's been a great honor to work with all of you as investors and as analysts. It's been very interesting. Many of you we've seen frequently enough, so that you're almost part of the family at this point.","You all should know that I'll miss the interactions with you, not doing it on a routine basis, but you all should also have very high confidence that the team we\u2019ve built here at United Rentals and the philosophies that we put in place here at United Rentals will continue after I'm gone.","We'll continue to take the investors' perspective. We'll continue to focus on driving top line growth with attractive returns attached to it. We'll continue to make good decisions about how we allocate capital and we'll continue to make prudent decisions about how we use the balance sheet to support our strategy. All those things are part of my legacy at United Rentals. I'm very proud of that legacy and I think you could all look forward to those thoughts continuing after I've left the stage.","So with that I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. And you guys will get your last shot at me. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, David.","David Raso","Hi. Thank you very much. I'm just trying to step back and think a little bit about the interplay between CapEx rate and you. I mean this year is shaping up to be, roughly CapEx up 7% to 10%, let's call you flat and rate let's just call it 2% to 3% roughly. There was a run last \u2013 early in the cycle this decade, you had a 16-straight-quarter-run where rates are up over 3% every quarter. You are still growing you and you are growing CapEx. I'm just trying to get a feel for the \u2013 how you view this cycle.","I can appreciate you, on an absolute level, pretty high. The CapEx is, obviously, been at your discretion. And then, how much fleet you put in this quarter to keep you flat was impressive. But can you \u2013 if we kept this sort of flat you kind of model from here for a while and you're growing the CapEx, say, similar next year as this year how should we think about rate in that dynamic?","I mean you can't think about rate in isolation, just as accelerating\/decelerating, it's the other two variables that impact it. But when I look back at the 16-quarter-run where rate was above 3% and we haven't been above 3% once yet of late. Just trying to make sure we frame exactly how we should think about the rate environment, again, if you is sort of flattish and CapEx is growing similar to this year?","Michael Kneeland","Yeah. David, maybe I'll lead off here on this one. Always very difficult to say what the rate is going to be. And so I won't address the 3% specific number. What I will say is that, we believe that the demand environment is robust and will continue to be so for some time to come. And as long as you're not overwhelming the rate, the demand with excess fleet, then you should be able to continue to move rates higher. For us it's less about hitting a specific great number like 3% and more about are we delivering a rate progression that allows us to be efficient and prudent in how we add capital to the business? And that translates into profit and margin and return performance that's attractive, right. That's really how we are thinking about it.","And so the rate environment we think will allow for that to continue. We have nice margin improvement and profit improvement in the quarter. We expect nice robust margin improvement and profit improvement for the full year. And we think that will carry over into nice return performance not only this year but next year. So I try not to get too focused in on one specific number and more is the rate environment that we have and expect can be commensurate with delivering the goals that we've set out.","David Raso","I appreciate the answer. That's what I'm trying to not do is look at one in isolation. But again if I just try to think about if I \u2013 again it's all how you try to manage it. But if we\u2019re trying to think about you as a somewhat flattish dynamic, you have the CapEx lever to pull. But when I think about the level of rates so far, would you at least go as far \u2013 it's your last call Billy you can say what you want. I mean, are we able at least think of \u2013 and I know those rates were also helped by your coming out of the Great Recession, so I know rates got very low back in 2008, 2009.","But is it inappropriate for us to think, if we think of the way you're thinking of the model, not saying you're going to guarantee your rate. But how your thinking about the model going forward if we\u2019re running at a bit as we like to bring in as much fleet as we can that can keep you flat at a high level that should also then spit out variable number three that rate can go back above the 3% that we saw for 16 straight quarters between 2011 and 2014. I'm \u2013 just how your \u2013 theoretically how we should think about it?","Michael Kneeland","Yeah. The concept of what you're laying out is useful concept where I get tripped up David is just the attaching a specific number to it, right? Whatever the rate environment is, is going to be okay as long as it translates into the kind of growth and profit and return that we feel is prudent and available for the business, right?","So if it's 3%, great. That's \u2013 you're getting it through a little bit more rate. But if it's 2.5% and you can manage through productivity or prudent investment in capital to translate that into profit and return performance that's attractive that's okay too. So that's why I'm having a hard time getting too tied into the exact formulation of the question is because the rate environment that we get depends how we view it depends on what we can do with it at the bottom line and in return.","William Plummer","And I think David, just looking at those 16 quarters you referenced and I\u2019m thinking \u2013 in isolation of the one metric and I'm thinking of what was the return profile at that point is also shortchanging, what we\u2019re doing today when we are getting a good return on the assets still being very prudent about managing rates and time and everything that we do. But I don't think you can look at it without thinking about what was the return profile when we had to go after 3.3. And the word had is important.","David Raso","I'll leave it at this then. Would you say rate growth the way you're thinking of running the business have we seen the best of rate growth so how you're thinking about moving forward from the second quarter? Just so we are all clear obviously people they are concerned about April, May, June the year-over-year growth rate within the quarter's slowed a bit and I'm just making sure we don't look at this as yes two way pro forma reported that's how we think of the strongest rate growth we'll see if we run the model even just flattish and growing CapEx high single digit. Just want to make sure that we hear an answer on that?","William Plummer","So as you know David those year-over-year rate increases are as much a result of the comp on last year. So it was 3% in April where you had an easier comp last year especially coming off a poor Q1 better than a 2.5% increase in June will not realize we are actually achieving a higher realized dollar in that June number. So we don't -- we are managing the business day to day and we've always been this way. It's not the year-over-year number that says relevant to us that's impacted by comps as what's the sequential bill and when we look at this your first six month sequential bill of rate mathematically and qualitatively it is a better rate improvement for the first six months of this year than it was the first six months of last year.","Michael Kneeland","David the other thing I would say if the market is there and we have the opportunity we are going to grab it. We are going to go for it and that's we are not shy and asking for higher rate. We pride ourselves in making sure that we are going to capture as much as we possibly can.","David Raso","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Great. Thank you. Yeah, good morning. Bill it's been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations on all your success that you are eyeing. All the best in your next endeavors?","William Plummer","Thank you, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","I was just wondering if you could quantify some of the cost issues that weighed on your incrementals in the first half and I think you're implying something like a 75% incremental in the second half correct me if I'm wrong on that? But things like freight labor fuel I mean aren't a lot of these things out of your control, what gives you confidence that many of these costs won't continue to go up like the actually done to get your arms around that cost situation?","William Plummer","Yes just so Ross just a quick comment and I think Matt will join in as well. Yes. Some of them are 'out of our control' in the sense that we can't control where fuel prices go for example we can't control how we recover fuel charges from the customers who use the fuel. So that's something that we are always looking out very carefully to make sure that if our costs are going up we pass them along. We think that's a reasonable expectation and so the customers usually don't get too much. The freight cost that do get passed along to us when we use outside freight it's hard to fight too much against that but that said we do have the ability to use our own internal delivery capabilities and leverage that more effectively when those costs are going up.","So that's what we're doing to try and address that particular cost item. And labor costs right our labor challenge has been about over time more so than wage inflation wage inflation has not ticked up significantly for us but our use of overtime is something that we have control over. And so being prudent about when we use overtime and how do we arrange our drivers and our texts to use them as productively as possible and cut down on the need for overtime is something that we could do here within the walls of United Rental.","So those are the things that we're doing to address those cost items. And I think we've had some success here as we've gone through the first half and come out of it having we positioned ourselves so that our expectation in the back half is that our costs are going to look more like what they\u2019ve look like in prior years.","Matthew Flannery","Ross, Bill, touched on the key components. Just to put it from an operational perspective and from our point of view what we've done to repair, is when you think about the Q1 and some spill over into April on using third-party services for delivery, third party services for repairs, specifically major repair, it's our slow time of the season. And if I'll be candid, I think our team overused those third-party resources and they came with a large inflationary cost this year. That's what we needed to mitigate.","We've in-sourced a lot of this work here in May and June and we've seen the positive results of doing that where are our costs look more in line with previous years as a percentage of either transactions or revenue, which ever you choose, do and that's what gives us confidence that we\u2019ve mitigated it, but it also adds capacity. So that in-sourcing has additional value longer term for growth.","Our team got excited to get ready for the ramp up to the year and wanted to get the fleet up and moving as quickly as they could and we have to stop the outsourcing. Inflation just prohibit it from being a profitable way to stuff done.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, I just want to run through some math. When you guys are going to do \u2013 you're guiding to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018. You\u2019ve got about $12 billion of fleet on OEC ex-Baker. I mean, fleet on OEC is growing 6% to 7% annually at your current annual run rate, net CapEx of like $1.3 billion.","So you don't really have to grow CapEx in future years in absolute dollars to support 6% to 7% volume growth, just kind of like what you're growing out right now. So what I'm getting at, is there any reason to think why your free cash flow generation would not continue to grow with EBITDA in the coming years, barring any big unforeseen changes in tax items or restructuring or anything like that?","William Plummer","Yeah. What I'd say, Ross, is that we certainly will make our decision about how much CapEx to spend based on, not only the external environment that we're seeing, but also on the needs of the fleet for refresh. Right? The used equipment sales picture. And that CapEx decision will have an impact on exactly where we end up in free cash flow.","That said, I think, it is fair to say that we expect a very robust free cash flow environment for 2019. Almost at any level of capital spend that we choose, were going to have a robust free cash flow picture. I won't go to the exact number, but it will be very strong and we'll continue to use that very prudently as we invest for the company's future.","Ross Gilardi","I wasn't trying to pin you down to an outlook, I just \u2013 was there anything flawed in the way of thinking about it? Obviously, that the \u2013 all the assumptions on CapEx are dynamic but\u2026?","William Plummer","No, nothing flawed in the overall frame that you laid out. And obviously, we'll talk about more specifics in 2019 as we get closer to it. Or I'll say, Jessica will talk about it.","Ross Gilardi","Great. All the best, Bill. Thank you.","William Plummer","Take care.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Seth.","Seth Weber","Thanks. Good morning. Bill it's been fun. So I just wanted to go back to the incremental margin question. I mean, just very specifically, I mean you've talked historically about this being a 60% incremental pull-through margin business. Is there anything that would cause you to kind of move off of that number?","And specifically my question is the margins for the specialty business were down year-over-year this quarter? And so given that you're pushing the specialty business more going forward, I understand that the returns on specialty are quite very attractive, but I'm just trying to understand is this still a 60% EBITDA pull-through margin business in your mind?","William Plummer","Thanks, Seth. So a couple of points. I'd say 50% and we've always said this right? 50% is not a bad way to think about the incremental margins available in this business. So I'll say that full stop. But you got to make sure that you understand the ins and outs. It's a very sensitive calculation you heard me talk about that before. That said I think that's a reasonable starting point. It certainly is going to be impacted as we grow specialty disproportionately and that's something that we want to make sure that we\u2019re mindful of us to think about its impact on flow through, but the reality is specialty growth is a unilaterally or an unalloyed good thing from a top-line perspective, from a margin perspective, from a return perspective. So we want to keep going as rapidly as we prudently can.","With regard to specialties gross margin performance in the quarter specifically. It was impacted in this quarter and will be impacted to probably a lesser extent as we go forward by increased depreciation, right. Gross margin so depreciation is in there. That depreciation is heavily driven by the Cummins acquisition, right. We bought the Cummins assets in the second half last year, and that depreciation is showing up more and more in the TPP segment margins. That's a major impact there.","We also had a lot of pull-starts and you all know that the pull-starts margin performance early in its life will way down. So as you have relatively more of those it tends to depress the margin results until those cold start locations mature. So those two dynamics were really at play in the segment margin results. It still is a very attractive business specialty I'm talking about. It still delivers incremental returns and profitability and margin and so that growth story I think you'll see us continue to emphasize go forward.","Seth Weber","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then as we think about the anniversary of the Neff acquisition, which I guess is the fourth quarter, I think the number you had talked about originally was $35 million of savings on a full run rate basis. Is there any help you can give us as to how much of that you would expect to realize in the fourth quarter \u2013 by the fourth quarter?","William Plummer","From Neff itself? Is that your question?","Seth Weber","Yeah. I think it was a 35 \u2013 wasn't \u2013 is that not correct 35 million saving \u2013 synergy number?","William Plummer","Yeah, that's about the number. So call it an impact in the fourth quarter of about $9 million or so from the synergies associated with Neff.","Seth Weber","Okay. So by the fourth quarter of this year, you should be at that kind of $9 million $10 million level?","William Plummer","Yes. We certainly should be there. We are not too far away from that as we speak. So I'll point out a couple of things as regards to the incremental margins in the back half of the year just so that everybody hears this at the same time. The Neff impact of anniversarying that acquisition will be a significant boost in fourth quarter flow through. And I'd just remind everybody of the mechanics of that in the year-over-year comparison which flow through is in the fourth quarter of this year we will then have the fixed cost of Neff in both periods and so as a result it won't represent as much of a weight on flow through as it has in the prior period.","So that will boost the flow through from the Neff acquisition mechanics. The other point that we mentioned in the first quarter as well is that our bonus accrual this year is going to be down from where it was last year last year was a record payout for us. We are improving something that's closer to a normal payout for us this year. That impact over the entire second half is going to be something like $27 million. And the dollars will probably be about equally split between third quarter and fourth quarter. So that's going to be a boost in both third and fourth quarter just from that factor alone. So those are the things that we think will help support the back half flow through to drive it up toward the range that we've given as our guidance.","Seth Weber","Perfect, okay. Thank you. Thanks Bill very helpful. Okay, take care.","William Plummer","Thanks, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your question, please.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi, good morning everyone.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer","So my question is on learning\u2019s from acquisitions. You touched on Neff kind of enhancing a little bit in dirt the infrastructure position. And I wanted to see how you felt about the strategic attractiveness of that industry for redeployment of future capital in whatever form. I mean just whether that looks good and whether it's more attractive than maybe what you would have thought two or three years ago maybe same question on Cummins and mobile power GEN stuff that you did there?","Matthew Flannery","Sure Rob. This is Matt. We absolutely learned a lot from the Neff acquisition there. They are deeper and broader fleet and expertise in dirt and even in some of the verticals that we come along with that as I referenced infrastructure in my opening remarks. I have really given the straight learning\u2019s and we could spread those learning\u2019s across our footprint. This is not dissimilar to what we've done with many of our acquisitions and they are more readily apparent in specialty where you broaden your product offering or your solution offering. So and we expect it by the way to do that where we can create a full fluid solutions business even on top of what's been a great pump business through our acquisition of National Pump a few years ago. So we absolutely have learning\u2019s from that. And as far as the other value of it other than the learning\u2019s the expertise or even the additional capacity right of talent is the extra customer base that comes with it to sell to. So there's a lot of reasons why we decide to do M&A and acquisitions. It's not just speed although that's part of it. It's the expertise the capacity the additional knowledge and access and that's been a big growth driver for us.","Rob Wertheimer","And so infrastructure is a theme or is a segment seems like it's attractive market is worthy of continued to investment having had this experience?","William Plummer","Yeah. And we've been investing and positioning ourselves and should we find how it's going to get funded that will be even icing on the cake upon what we see today. But this is something we've been building up for and when we\u2019re reviewing the net acquisition it has additional boost to, not just vertical, but that vertical within additional boost to that acquisition.","Michael Kneeland","If you take a look at the end market \u2013 this is Mike, just for a moment. If you take a look at the infrastructure market, we can always debate where it stands right now, but I don't think there's any argument that the need for infrastructure needs to improve. It's not a question of \u2013 it's a question of when. And we just want to \u2013 the learning\u2019s help us become better prepared for when that comes and it's \u2013 as Matt mentioned take that aside for a moment, it's still a growth opportunity for us.","Rob Wertheimer","Would you mind touching on what you've seen from the Cummins assets?","William Plummer","Thank you. Actually, I knew you had a second half to your question. The Cummins asset has gotten us into the larger end of power and the team has done a great job with. That has been a homerun acquisition. I know we referred it early as some of the drag of the depreciation on the margin, but the Cummins don't confuse that with the value and accretiveness of the Cummins deal. It's been a great deal, that the team members that came with it, the assets that came with it have really deepened our penetration into the power space in a big way.","Rob Wertheimer","I\u2019ll stop there, other than to stay bill you\u2019ve been part of an extraordinary \u2013 really extraordinary story, and so congratulations on this phase of your career.","William Plummer","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question, please.","Joseph O'Dea","Hi. Good morning. First in terms of \u2013 I mean, we see good sequential rate trends in the quarter for you, I think in terms of what you're seeing for the broader industry and insight that you get through data that Rouse collects and just whether or not you\u2019ve seen any cracks in the industry's commitments rates. I think, towards end of last year and first half of this year, still hearing about a really strong focus on rate, maybe some of the concern out there is that some of that could be easing a little bit. But through the end of the quarter and even now, just what you're seeing, not only internally but in the broader rate environment?","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, Joe. Actually, quite the opposite. So we've seen \u2013 what is it? 22 consecutive months? 24 consecutive months of positive absorption and that Rouse data that you referred to, which is very important for rate integrity, but just as importantly as we've seen the rest of the industry and admittedly tracking about 40%, 45% of the industry, which we think is a great sample size, is acting very similar from a rate perspective that we are. So we\u2019re very encouraged with that and I think it points to not just the robust demand, but also the discipline of the industry and that's something that we're happy to see.","Joseph O'Dea","And then, just following the Baker deal and thinking about the pipeline in specialty opportunities. How does Baker kind of stack versus what other things that you see in the pipeline? Do you see a healthy kind of portion of opportunities to a $300 million of revenue? Or is that something that's pretty high relative to what you see out there? Just trying to understand what the M&A outlook looks like as it relates to specialty?","William Plummer","Well, I would tell you it's very robust. The teams out there, I give them a lot of credit. They've been very busy as you can see by our announcements over the past 18 months. They are out there. They are doing as much diligence as they can to understand the industry dynamics. But it follows along the lines of our strategic \u2013 around our return metrics that Bill mentioned and around the cultural aspects of it. So all three of those we take a look at. We don't look at size. We just looked at the principles that we have out there. We are in a good place because we can be selective and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor, be active, and be good stewards of the capital and spend it in the right way.","Joseph O'Dea","Got it. Thanks very much, and Bill congrats and best wishes in whatever comes next.","William Plummer","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Morning.","Courtney Yakavonis","Morning, guys. Just when \u2013 I'm looking at your gen rent margins, obviously, they picked up versus a decline last quarter. Can you help us understand how much of that was just from the lapping of the NES acquisition and whether that was weighing on your margin, so we should see an acceleration from here? And then obviously an additional one in 4Q when Neff rolls off, or was that more just the cost management you were talking about with the Ross and getting freight and some of the other third-party costs under control?","William Plummer","Yeah, Courtney I don't have a specific breakout. It's clear that both actors were at play. I do think it's critical for us to have a better sense of where we are in the cost front, and as Matt said I think I try to indicate we\u2019re better positioned now as we look at the second half against those cost items. So, both were at play. I couldn't give you a breakout of how much is cost versus how much is acquisition impact without going and doing some additional work.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Understand that. And then you\u2019d also just spoken about ancillary being I believe 15 million year-over-year. I believe that's where you pass through a lot of these freight and fuel cost. So I just wanted to understand did that directly offset one-for-one this quarter, or was there a lag? And how should we be thinking about that kind of for the rest of this year? And was \u2013 it can maybe just how big of a factor was that in the revenue guidance increase you have?","William Plummer","Yeah. Good question. The fuel component we have a fairly automated process for how we adjust our fuel pricing and fuel recovery as a result. So, I hesitate to say its one-for-one but it's closer to one-for-one when fuel prices go up.","The delivery charges are little bit left direct. And so there's probably somewhat of a lag there as we have to get the entire organization to adjust to sort of higher targeted delivery charges as those costs go up for us. So yeah if you will closer to one-for-one delivery is somewhat of a lag.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. And was it a large factor in part of the 150 million revenue increase?","William Plummer","In the guidance?","Courtney Yakavonis","Yeah.","William Plummer","It was part of that story. It's something that we think we have to continue to chase after in order to deal with the increases in cost that we are seeing in the rest of the business.","Michael Kneeland","Yeah. And just additionally Bill covered it accurately. When you think about, if we have an outside haler that's charging us $50 more on the trip and we pass that $50 more on it is going to move the top line. One of the things that you see playing through temporarily here is that incremental $50 is going to come at zero flow through. So that's just something that we have to work through and we'll continue to work with the team to catch up on it but you saw a little of that play through in the first half.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks, Court.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup. Your question please.","Tim Thein","Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning. So maybe a bigger picture one for Michael or Matt last quarter you had talked about more optimism regarding the large project pipeline and what you guys are seeing in terms of quoting activity. I'm just curious given what's transpired since then with regards to all of those tariff noise and potential policy uncertainty have you seen any change or shifts in terms of the tone of your customer discussions?","Michael Kneeland","No Tim we haven't. And we talked about that. Obviously we have our customer confidence index and we tracked that remains robust. More importantly we talk to our field leaders and field sales teams specifically the strategic teams that are engaging with the large customers on large projects. And I can point to one project that's been canceled because of any kind of tariff concerns inflation concerns or anything else. So it's still robust. We still feel really good about the end market. And as you can see through all our actions we feel that this -- we have legs left to this cycle and we are excited about that.","Tim Thein","Okay. And then Matt just on the sequential rates just to circle back on that can you give us any color even if it's just kind of directionally with respect to how rates has outperformed between the transactional business versus your longer term contracts? Basically the spirit of the question is if as you continue to grow specialty does that at all mask how much we should expect to see in terms of a monthly sequential change just you naturally have less business that's repricing every month?","Matthew Flannery","No. No not really. You have to remember so much of the specialty growth is in cross sell that's going to act very similar from a pricing mechanism to the rest of our business. We are negotiating with the same customers and as far as I guess also part of that question is we've been asked so I'll answer it is how we are National Accounts versus your transactional accounts. We see a very similar pattern in the half for a while about pricing behavior and opportunity in both albeit at a lower base right? As you would have imagine our National Accounts leverage their spend they have a lower realized cost versus the transactional customer but this is across the board effort of rate management not just trying to find honey holes to get some rate and we are very disciplined about our rate management.","Tim Thein","Okay. All right, thanks for the color Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.","Stanley Elliott","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. You guys have done such a good job on the speed of which you can integrate a lot of these deals. Looking at the Baker assets maybe a little bit larger is there anything from a real estate perspective that would keep the Baker integration from not tracking kind of at this accelerated pace from what we've seen in the recent deals?","Matthew Flannery","No the team has been working on it this weekend and last week actually doing a lot of strategy work before close. The good news is that we don't need a lot of store closures that kind of integration so they have ample real estate. We even have the opportunity to grow that footprint over time, similar to what we did with the Pump acquisition. Although, there are some synergies in the model and in our communication. I think it's important to note the real win here on the Baker deal is the cross-sell.","It is a growth opportunity that we feel is there where we can capitalize what's 76-year-old business, a lot of institutional knowledge and expertise and how we can bring that into our portfolio and capitalize it for growth. That's the play here for the Baker acquisition. And there's nothing that feels \u2013 makes us feel as if we\u2019ll have to move slower than our normal rapid pace on integration.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect guys. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks very much and Bill, best of luck.","William Plummer","Thank you, Stanley.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you. I think that's it, operator. Yeah, as always, you can always connect with Ted for the \u2013 who heads our IR if you have additional questions and our investor deck is out on our website. So look forward to talk to you again in 90 days. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"21197":["United Rentals, Inc.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.","Michael Kneeland","Thanks operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. So before I begin, I want to mention that my prepared remarks this morning will be followed by comments from Matt. Most of you know Matt is our Chief Operating Officer and a 20-year veteran of our Company. Last month, he assumed the additional role of President, which means he is even more instrumental in working with me and Bill to guide our Company's growth. Matt will speak about our markets and operations and then Bill will go over the numbers.","So I'll start with the dialogue by saying that I am pleased with the results we reported yesterday. Both Gen Rents and Specialty segments performed well. There were a number of positive indicators in the quarter, including a 6.8% increase in volume year-over-year and a 2.7% improvement in rental rates. These numbers are pro forma for last year's acquisitions.","Now given the importance of rates in our business, it is good to see the improvement sustained throughout the quarter. Rates remain a key indicator of the overall health of the marketplace and our industries ability to generate attractive returns. Time utilization came in at 65.2%, down 20 basis points pro forma.","That's the second highest time utilization we've achieved in any first quarter in our history. And there were some obstacles in the quarter, but we dealt with those effectively, and once again, our rental revenue growth outpaced the market.","And then there is cash generation. As you saw yesterday, our free cash flow for the quarter was $526 million after gross CapEx of $313 million. Now given the way the years unfolding, we feel very comfortable with our guidance for free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and we've also re-informed the rest of our full-year outlook.","So let's talk about the use of cash. Over the last five years, our business has generated $4 billion of cumulative free cash flow, some of that in markets that weren't as robust as the current year. In 2018, the cycle is in our favor with an added tax benefit from tax reform. And as we continue to explore potential opportunities to redeploy this capital, you can expect us to make the kind of thoughtful, diligent, and balanced decisions to be accretive to our shareholder value as we have in the past.","So yesterday we announced that our Board has authorized a program for another $1.25 billion of share repurchases. This will initiate when we wrap up the current program, which we would expect to finish out mid-year. And you may recall that the current program was authorized in November of 2015 for $1 billion. We paused for 13 months while we evaluated M&A and then reactivated it.","We have about $168 million left to go, and once that ends, the follow-on program will begin. Our goal is to complete the $1.25 billion of new repurchases by the end of 2019. And we have an excellent track record with these programs. Since 2012, we've returned almost $2.3 billion of cash to repurchases as a means of maximizing shareholder value.","And now over the course of 2018 and 2019, we are planning to purchase what equates to over 10% of our current market cap. Now to be clear, share repurchase is just one lever in a complex framework of decisions we make the balance growth and returns while preserving a sound capital structure. We remain open to all avenues that are strategically compelling and create superior value including further M&A.","Now before I hand it off to Matt, I want to return to something that\u2019s always been important to me personally. That is our culture as a safety leader. Safety is the ultimate metric of operational excellence in our business. It aligns the interest of our employees, our customers, and our investors, so everybody wins.","We just delivered the 15 straight quarter of a reportable rate at or below one, and that's a remarkable achievement on the part of our team. And in the month of March, 99% of our locations had zero reportable incidents. Now this kind of culture is fundamental to success of our business and particularly when things get busy like we are doing right now. And when we\u2019re entering our peak months in a very strong demand environment, our performance is tracking to plan and virtually all key leading indicators are positive. Now the intersection of these dynamics creates a significant opportunity for United Rentals. Our guidance reflects our belief that 2018 will be another very good year for us.","And now I\u2019ll ask Matt to talk about the operations and share how we plan to capitalize on the months ahead. So over to you, Matt.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks Mike, and good morning. I thought I'd start by commenting on the integration of NES and Neff. And both are essentially complete, and we\u2019ve realized the target run rate and synergies in each case. NES still has a few operational ends to tie-up like centralized dispatch, which is currently in rollout. All other programs have been adopted into regular operations. So from this point forward, there's no distinction in how we talk about the company. It's all one United Rentals.","Now here\u2019s where we stand today with the first quarter behind us. We\u2019re a much larger and better equipped customer service network than we were 12 months ago and that's exciting for the field. It's an opportunity for United Rentals to get a bigger piece of the pie, and we did just that with a 25% year-over-year increase in rent revenue in the first quarter.","If we pull back the curtain on our results, the main drivers behind our growth fall into four buckets. One is a widespread strength in non-residential construction, particularly in the commercial and infrastructure sectors; second, is the rebound in industrial activity, including the improvement of oil and gas; and third, is our Specialty segment, which continues to deliver impressive results; fourth, is our scale. And I\u2019ll talk a little more about scale in a few minutes.","So starting with the non-residential construction. The leading U.S. indicators have been almost universally positive for a while now, and we're seeing this echoed in our monthly surveys where customer confidence continues to trend up. The most active geographies are the ones with the most diverse project mix. Along the Eastern Seaboard in the Gulf States are good examples. They both had double-digit increase in rent revenue in the quarter and the wins came from a broad range of projects, including infrastructure, power, retail, and commercial work.","Now looking at the industrial sector, we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread activity across multiple verticals and we're tracking a number of large projects slated to start up in the back half of the year that will carryover into 2019. Also the oil and gas sector continues to be a pleasant surprise. The rise in oil prices has encouraged drilling and production companies to bring rigs back online and this adds to the broader industrial demand for our equipment.","Turning to our Specialty segment, rent revenue from our Trench, Power, and Pump operations was up more than 36% year-over-year and Specialty segment gross margin also improved up 170 basis points. And we\u2019re currently planning to open 18 specialty cold-starts to this year and we will increase that number if this pace continues.","There are some of the market dynamics, and as we said before, we also have internal levers for growth, which brings me to the final bucket I mentioned, scale. The scale provides benefits for us under any set of conditions, including the growth environment that we're in today. And I can tell you firsthand that equipment availability is proving to be a challenge for some rental companies. Customers worry about being able to find the equipment they need to keep their projects on track and we're very fortunate to be able to give them that assurance.","We entered 2018 with a much larger fleet and footprint. Our fleet stands at almost $11.4 billion and we have about 15,000 employees serving our customers. Additionally, our digital capabilities are reaching more customers every day. All of this scale is beneficial, but it's our ability to leverage our scale that gives our customers the assurance I mentioned.","And one of the most important ways we leverage our scale is by cross-selling. When you see the rapid growth of our Specialty segment for example, it's not just because each branch operates strongly, independently. There's a significant benefit that comes from giving our customers access to our entire network of offerings.","Cross-selling is as much about customer service as it is about revenue. The customers that we added from NES and Neff are happy to keep more of their business with the United Rentals and all of our customers in the combined base are benefiting from a larger and broader fleet. And as a result, in the first quarter, our cross-selling company-wide rent revenue was up 29% year-over-year and we still have more to deliver.","Now before I wrap up, I would like to make a quick comment on Canada. Back in January, we described Canada as an outlier that showed signs of turning around. And I am pleased to report that our first quarter rent revenue in Canada was up 11% with rates positive year-over-year and signs of a continued macro improvement.","Ontario and Quebec both had big plans for infrastructure, including a massive public transit project in Montreal and Western Canada continues to rebound, so it\u2019s a good overall story for our Canadian operations. But that\u2019s a snapshot from the field. We have a high level of confidence in our outlook for 2018. We expanded our operations at an ideal time to leverage the cycle, and at the same time we are giving our customers and investors even more reason to have confidence in us.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill for the financial review and then we'll go to Q&A. Bill?","William Plummer","Thanks, Mike, and Matt, and good morning to everybody. As always I'll go through the results and try to do it quickly, so that we can get to the questions. Starting with rental revenue, rental revenue $1.166 billion in the quarter, that's up $293 million over last year. The key components of ancillary and re-rent will start there. Ancillary was up $32 million, so pretty robust growth there and it came across the board.","Higher delivery charges, higher fuel recovery, our rental protection program revenues were up and the impact of NES and Neff just for pure volume growth was a real contributor. So $32 million increase over last year for ancillaries, re-rent was up $4 million another robust increase almost 20% increase over last year, again helped along by the acquisitions.","The owned equipment revenue was up a total of $257 million over last year and the big driver there was volume. Our volume impact was $264 million for that 26% or so increase in OEC on rent. Rate contributed a nice component this year. $19 million of rate impact in revenue, again aligning with the 1.9% rate improvement that we saw on a reported basis.","Replacement CapEx inflation this quarter was about $15 million of headwind. That's calculated at 1.5% purchase price inflation and then that leads $11 million of mix and other headwind in the quarter for the total 257 in OER. So add that to the ancillary re-rent you get the $293 million year-over-year improvement in rental revenue. That\u2019s as reported as I called out just to know the pro forma revenue performance was pretty robust. 9.9% increase in rental revenue in the quarter on a pro forma basis.","Used equipment was an important part of the story in the quarter. $181 million of used proceeds in the quarter and that was up $75 million over last year. A couple of comments on that used performance.","First, the overall strength of the market I think is really noteworthy. The proceeds that $181 million as a percent of the OEC that we sold came in at 52.6% that's 130 basis points higher than it was last year. That certainly reflected the strength of the market in pricing, but also in the volume that the used equipment market is able to absorb.","On the pricing front, our pricing results in our retail sales of used in the quarter prices were up about 6% in the quarter, pretty robust for us and certainly reflects robust pricing in the overall used equipment market. And again the volume that we were able to sell was pretty strong as well in the quarter. $343 million of OEC sold in the quarter. It was underneath that proceeds result.","The other important factor in the quarter for used equipment was the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This is nothing unique to United Rentals. I'm sure you all know about the adoption of ASC 606 for most publicly reporting companies at the beginning of the year. An important change in that revenue recognition standard for us was that we no longer defer revenue from used sales of equipment back to our vendors.","In prior years we would agree to sell equipment back to vendors and typically do so with an associated purchase commitment. And previously, our accounting standard would require us to defer the revenue and profit associated with those used sales until we completed the subsequent purchase commitment. The new rev standard just requires that upon the completion of the sale transaction, the delivery of the equipment, we now recognize the profit and the revenue immediately.","That impact was about $44 million in revenue in the quarter and the margins of our sales back to vendors in this quarter were not materially different than the overall margin, so call it about $23 million or so of gross margin impact in the quarter. Very importantly, this is a timing effect, nothing more. So over the course of the year, this impact will fade, but certainly, it is an artifact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.","So those are the comments I wanted to make on the used equipment results. Just moving to EBITDA overall $780 million, that's up $189 million versus last year and it came in at a margin of 45%. That margin was improved by 140 basis points over last year, and again, all of this on an as-reported basis. To break down the $189 million year-over-year change, volume obviously was the major driver. We calculate that as about $177 million of volume impact and then the rental rates also added another $18 million or so of EBITDA over last year.","Ancillary was about a $16 million benefit compared to last year and then used equipment, the robust quarter contributed about $44 million of EBITDA impact. That $44 million is coincidentally the same as the revenue timing impact of the adoption of the new accounting standards.","Fleet inflation, we called out as a $13 million headwind. Merit increase is a $6 million of headwind, and then a large mix and other in the quarter of minus $47 million. The great majority of that negative $47 million is the impact of the addition of NES and Neff costs compared to last year. And it's also an artifact of how we actually calculate the volume component that I called out in the $177 million. The revenue that NES and Neff brought along in this year compared to last year came along with both variable cost and fixed costs.","The variable cost component we\u2019ve signed up in the volume number that I called out. The fixed costs all falls to this mix and other number. So that was the biggest chunk of the minus $47 million that we're calling mix and other. There are also other timing and other effects that fall into this number as well as the impact of the synergies that we realize for Neff and NES which we would callout at a positive $18 million between the two acquisitions, 10 for NES and about eight realized in the quarter for Neff.","So those are the key drivers of the adjusted EBITDA performance on the quarter. They resulted in a flow through calculation of 50% on an as-reported basis and we can certainly go through the flow through discussion more in the Q&A. But I would just point out that if you calculated flow through on a pro forma basis, I know you guys can't do that, but we've done it. Our pro forma flow through in the quarter was 61% during the quarter.","EPS, $2.87 of adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter that compares to $1.63 last year and that increase was driven mainly by the improvement in EBITDA, but also the impact of tax reform. Tax reform benefited us something like $0.50 over last year as that single factor in Q1. So $0.50 out of the $1.24 or so that we improved year-over-year, we could put down the tax reform.","Free cash flow in the quarter was strong, $526 million when you exclude the impact of the merger and restructuring related costs, those came in at about $10 million in the quarter. So $526 million, a $36 million improvement over the same year-to-date number last year. Obviously, the operating profitability was the main driver of that improvement, EBITDA of $189 million as we talked about.","The rental CapEx story, rental CapEx is a little bit lower; the net rental CapEx was a little bit lower this year compared to last down about $14 million. That net rental CapEx was a result of higher gross CapEx spending, but also the larger used equipment sales result that we talked about previously.","Cash taxes, the cash tax is paid. We\u2019re about $9 million higher this year compared to last year. And then we had a timing of interest expense and cash interest paid that that was a little bit of a headwind call it, $60 million or so in the quarter. The rest was working capital for about $95 million more working capital this year compared to last year.","Net debt and liquidity, our debt balance at the end of the quarter $8.9 billion of net debt that's higher than last year, but obviously reflects the increase for the acquisitions that we did last year in NES, Neff and a couple of other small ones like Cummins and others. So $1.9 billion increase in net debt, but certainly in line with the acquisitions primarily.","Liquidity finished the quarter at $1.9 billion in total liquidity. Within that $1.6 billion was availability on the ABL facility, along with about $280 million of cash on the balance sheet. Just real quickly on returns ROIC in the quarter was 9.4%. You all know that's a trailing 12-month calculation that we do that TTM was up a percentage point over the same period last year.","And I'll just point out again even though we did it previously that the way we calculate ROIC includes the tax rates that apply at the time period that that's involved in the trailing 12-month period. So in this calculation we had the new 21% federal tax rate for the first quarter of 2018, but also 35% old tax rate for the last three quarters of last year that were in the calculation period. If we had used to 21% new tax rate for the entire period. The ROIC calculation would have been 10.8% for the trailing 12-month period, which would have been 80 basis points higher than the prior period.","The share repurchase, just a brief update there. We bought about 1 million shares back in the quarter, $177 million of cash spent on those repurchases and that left this as Mike pointed out with about $168 million remaining on the existing program. The new program authorization will begin when we complete that $168 million, which should be mid-year and as we've done in the past, we expect to be in the market buying back shares fairly steadily against the new program once we do started to complete it by the end of next year.","Neff integration and synergy update, I think we touched on, but just to put a number to it the Neff integration. We think resulted in realized synergies of a little over $8 million in the quarter and the run rate we calculated about $35 million. So right there at the total run rate of annualized synergies that we expected out of Neff. We got there a little sooner than we thought, but I think it just indicates that the quality of the execution on the integration there. Just real quickly on fleet procurement phase, we call those out in the $5 million to $10 million range and we're well on track to deliver those as well.","You've all seen the guidance, so I won't repeat the guidance numbers other than to say that we obviously reaffirmed all of the elements of the guidance that we've given and I think that reflects the fact that we feel good about how the first quarter of the year started out. It was certainly in line with what we expected to be able to deliver the overall guidance for the full-year and it's boasted by the fact that the market environment we perceive as being quite strong and our execution in that environment we feel very comfortable with will get us where we need to be over the course of the year.","So maybe I'll stop there and open up the call for questions at this point, so operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, Good morning.","Michael Kneeland","Hey, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Look I think consensus was probably still baking in at 1.5% to 2% rate environment for 2018 and I did say that based on the comments that you made about the carryover into this year last quarter, I mean pro forma pricing was up 2.7% year-on-year in the first quarter and you haven't seen that rate of growth in a few years, so look realizing guide on rate when you consider how tight the used equipment is right now? Is there a credible argument for some markets to go back to say a plus 3% to 5% rate environment in the next year or two like they did earlier in the cycle?","William Plummer","So is there a credible argument? Yes, there's a credible argument to do that and certainly you can make your own judgment about how likely that that is to happen. Our view is that the market environment certainly would support a good rate realization and I think the path that we are on, we're encouraged by that. 2.7%, if you asked us before the quarter whether we\u2019d be there, we probably say not yet.","So that's encouraging for us, right as we think about where things could go, so yes, credible environment. Maybe I\u2019ll take the opportunity just you said credible for 3% to 5% and take the opportunity maybe a question given the sequential path that we experienced in the first quarter.","If you repeated the last three quarters sequentials that we achieved last year with the start that we've had this year that number would take us to 2.9%. If you repeated sort of the average of the sequentials that we\u2019ve achieved in the last three quarters over the last three to five years with the start that we've had this year that sequential pattern would take us to about 2.5%.","So certainly feels reasonable to say we're in that 2.5% to 3% range and could we accelerate from here to get into 3% to 5% range that's not ridiculous. So hopefully that's helpful for you Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Yes. Thanks Bill. Any signs of slippage at all in the used equipment market?","William Plummer","No, it's continuing to be pretty robust. I think if you just look at the pricing that we've realized about 6% that we realized this year compares to something in the neighborhood of 5% that we realized back in the fourth quarter. I think that just aren't priced basis alone suggest that that market still pretty robust, and as I said it's still demanding pretty good volume. So that market feels pretty good right now.","Ross Gilardi","And then just lastly guys, I mean you talked a bit about your free cash flow history over the last few years. Any thoughts on just the sustainability the type of free cash flow that you're generating right now beyond 2018?","William Plummer","I think it's fair to say that if 2019 looks anything like 2018 we're going to have another very robust free cash flow story for next year as well, right. The benefit of tax reform, the strength of our overall operating profitability, the amount of capital that we would have to put into the business to kind of sustain a comparable demand environment, all would argue for another north of the $1 billion free cash flow year next year and that's the backdrop that we're thinking about as we think about capital allocation decisions. So another good year, next year assuming that the market continues.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks guys.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Courtney Yakavonis","Thanks guys. Just curious on the equipment sales, the shift that you had into the first quarter, do you have any guidance for \u2013 just on how to think about what that means for in the second through fourth quarters for this year?","Matthew Flannery","Courtney, this is Matt. It does not change our full-year outlook. We still expect to sell somewhere around $1.2 billion of OEC as we talked about in January of $1.2 billion for the full-year. This is just \u2013 you folks are seen based on the change in the accounting rules that Bill mentioned in his comments.","You're seeing more of it than you usually would, but Q1 is always been the time of the year where we sell a lot of our assets on the trade-in basis because it's our trough and time utilization and it's the best time of year to get rid of the old fleet. Just the factoid that you folks don't know that fleet that we sold to vendors averaged 113 months.","So we're really talking about a portion of that fleet more than 10 years old. So we're selling nine to 10-year old fleet and we look at the first quarter as an opportunity to cleanse that, refresh the fleet and make sure that we're giving the customers the type of product they expect from us.","Courtney Yakavonis","Great. Thanks. And then just on the specialty, can you help us understand how much of the growth is related to the acquisitions versus cold starts versus same-store sales? And then just on the cold starts, just give us a little bit of color on how those stores are performing in years two and three and if there's any significant difference between any of the lines?","William Plummer","Courtney, the bulk of the TCP segment growth was same-store in the mid-20% out of that 36% was same-store growth. So a pretty robust story there, even though we had \u2013 for that business a reasonably significant acquisition in the form of Cummins last year. So we certainly feel good about the business even on the same-store basis, but we also are growing the footprint of the business. We're going to add a total of 18 or so cold starts this year, the great majority of which will be specialty location. So we will enhance that same-store growth again as we go forward with the new footprint.","Courtney Yakavonis","Awesome. Thanks guys.","William Plummer","Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Michael Kneeland","Good morning.","Jerry Revich","I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about whether you view \u2013 whether having any impact on the first quarter, if at all, a number of folks from channel have been complaining about seasonality this year more so than normal. Did you see it in your business? And as you folks think about the cadence into 2Q, I guess, we look for stronger than normal seasonality utilization pick up if weather was a factor in the first quarter?","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Jerry. This is Matt. I think you saw a little bit of a concern, specifically in March, that 40 bps pro forma drop in time utilization. We attributed to two major factors for us, a little bit of weather and then the timing of the holiday. So the week leading up to Easter happened to fall in March. So we saw a little bit of drop off from our normal cycle, which we expected to pick that up in April, and as we sit here we're very comfortable that that things have had normalized for us to what more or like what we expected.","So I wouldn't see \u2013 I wouldn't be concerned about that. I\u2019d also point to the balance that we had. One thing I'm really encouraged about is the rate performance in Q1. And keeping that balance of rate and time is real important to us. We talked about that all the time. And last year, quite frankly, we dug a bit of a rate hole while having very strong time utilization. We\u2019re very conscious about not digging the rate hole this year because that first quarter compounds on it. So we're very comfortable with where we are right now.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And from a capital deployment standpoint, obviously very active year for you folks last year. Can you talk about what your M&A pipeline looks like at this point? And obviously, big buyback announcement maybe that ties into it to some extent? Bill, can you just step us through it?","Michael Kneeland","I'll start and then I\u2019ll ask Bill to chime in, but I think what you're really highlighting is the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow gives us a lot of optionality. And acquisitions happen as they happen. Pipeline, we're always out there looking for companies that meet our criteria and our discipline \u2013 we remain focused on our discipline, making sure that, strategically, why would we be good owners of that asset, number one. Two, financial, how does it affect us and then how can we get an ample return.","And then third thing is culture, and we're very strict on those. And if we don't do a deal is because one of those \u2013 one of that legs of that stool didn't make it and we have the discipline to walk away, but having said that, it is our optionality that we have at this point in time.","William Plummer","And I\u2019ll only add that we view acquisition as the higher and better uses of our capital and cash flow then buying back shares. And so we want to make sure that we are ready to do those acquisitions that make the right sense. And that's partly why we take a slow and steady approach to executing share repurchase, right.","We want to make sure that, yes, okay, the Board authorized a new $1.25 billion program. We don't want to go out and blow it all right now because there maybe deals that come along that are really appealing. So let's be slow and steady in executing it and make sure that we're ready to go when the right deal shows up, and we will continue to do that, right. We've established a pretty good track record in how we approach managing the repurchase program. But if we do it with an eye towards, hey, if a better deal comes along like an acquisition, then we want to use it the used cash flow for that rather than just buying back share.","Jerry Revich","And I appreciate that it's an involving market, but the pipeline as it stands now how active is it?","Michael Kneeland","It's always active. It doesn't \u2013 as you can imagine specialty is an area of interest for us and there is no secret. And as we went through last year, we did a couple fairly sizable Gen Rent acquisitions, where we're open minded, and \u2013 but the pipeline has always been pretty active.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Seth.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning, guys. So I think what something that I think people are wrestling with is the implied incremental margin that's kind of baked in the getting to the midpoint of your ranges for the year. I think even if you back out the $30 million or so of incentive comp tailwind that's 2018 versus 2017. It's still implies a pretty healthy mid-to-high 60% incremental margin for the rest of the year. So can you kind of talk us through your comfort level on that number and why that's an attainable number from here? Thanks.","William Plummer","Sure, Seth. Really \u2013 holding aside the bonus impact is the story of the acquisitions. NES, we anniversary in the second quarter. Neff, we anniversary in the fourth quarter. There will be nice moves to our incremental margin our flow through in those quarters just reflecting the mechanics of adding their revenue and the cost that that come along with that revenue this year versus last year. It\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to quantify, but it certainly is going to be a material impact in both Q2 and particular in Q4.","Seth Weber","Okay. And then how should we think about the incentive comp kind of cadence through the year as a tailwind year-over-year?","Michael Kneeland","The main impact is going to come in Q3 and Q4. So in the first quarter, the year-over-year comparison was basically flat. That's probably going to be the story in the second quarter right assuming that we don't have a surprise in the performance and therefore have to adjust the accrual differently than what we've got in mind right now. So it will be basically flat effect for Q2. It\u2019s really about $15 million of the impact in Q3 and Q4 each that that we're expecting right here and now, just based on the pacing of how we adjusted the accruals last year versus what we think we're going to do this year.","Seth Weber","Okay. But \u2013 the numbers that we're talking about the mid-to-high 60% incremental that's the right way to \u2013 that's how you're thinking about and that's an accurate characterization?","Michael Kneeland","Yes, the timing is certainly skewed toward the back end of the year. It's going to be more third and fourth quarter, second half of the year event than second quarter, but we expect to see some fairly robust impacts in the back half of the year to the incremental margins because of those factors that we talked about.","Seth Weber","Okay, thanks. And then I'm sorry if I missed it, but given some of them whether disruptions are one not that you experienced in March. Can you give us any feel for how April is going and it's obviously an important month kind of kicking off in the construction season so any color on April trends would be great?","Michael Kneeland","I think Matt will touch that.","Matthew Flannery","Yes, so I touch on a little bit, but just to repeat, we don't give the specifics of into quarter, but we wouldn't have pointed out that the 40 bps in March was due to weather and holiday unless we felt that it remedied and you can take that the guidance that we're giving to reaffirm means that we feel like the temporary time utilization lapse that we saw in March is remedied and demand continues to be strong for the balance of the year.","Seth Weber","Okay, so that's \u2013 those products of restarted. The branches are reopened. That's right we think about that?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, just a delay in the cycle. We don't expect to have the closures that we had in Q1, and once again a little bounce back that you get in the first week after Easter as opposed to before just a timing issue, but it got our attention, we dug into it, and we feel comfortable with it.","Seth Weber","Okay, guys. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your question please.","Steven Ramsey","Good morning. This is Steven Ramsey on for Kathryn. You guys previously had talked about raising the target for Project XL. Obviously, you didn\u2019t raise it, but it said this maybe a possibility. Any update on Project XL?","William Plummer","Sure, Steven. So we've been sharing with you the \u2013 a few of the projects, underneath Project XL in our quarterly investor decks as we\u2019ve gone the last several quarters, and the Project XL is a complex topic to try and talk about, but we try to simplify it by just focusing on a few of the projects underneath it, so those four projects that we've shared actual data on. What we would say is that the metrics that those projects are tracking have already gotten us to about a $200 million run rate for those projects.","Now I hesitate to say that because as we said again and again, the metrics that those projects are tracking you should not think about incremental EBITDA. Certainly there is incremental EBITDA in there, but their duplications between the projects and there are certain components of those projects that would have been there anywhere, anyway without Project XL.","But in terms of the $200 million run rate of the metrics that the Project XL projects are tracking, I say we're pretty doggone close to the $200 million run rate already and that would led us to say that we\u2019re thinking about increasing the targets that we talked about.","But just as we've gone deeper and deeper into looking at the performance of these XL projects, it has become just much more clear how difficult it is to have a conversation with you guys in the outside world without diving into huge complexity. So we just simplified and said look at these four projects. They're delivering something in the neighborhood of $200 million run rate of impact.","By the way when you look at the entire list of Project XL initiatives, it\u2019s still in aggregate right around the $200 million impact. So it's not like we're cherry picking those four projects, just those four easy to talk about to the outside world. But we feel good about Project XL, we feel it\u2019s delivering very much in line with what we expected, and we think it's an important part of how we continue to drive productivity improvement in our business and so we'll keep running that.","Steven Ramsey","Excellent. And then with the energy in market starting to recover, are you changing or editing your plans to invest in that market or aggressively as oil prices and rig counts move up or is it planned expansion same as in the past?","Michael Kneeland","So Steven when thinking about the upstream exploration and the rig counts improving and based on oil prices as I referred to in the opening comments, we're certainly participating in that. We\u2019ve had really nice growth there, but most of the growth has been through our pump business that as a matter of fact more than half of our growth in Q1 was through our pump business where we held on to some specialized products to serve that end market.","So we didn't have to invest any incremental capital there, which we're really pleased with and kind of validated decision the team made to hold on to those assets. With all that being said and with the strong growth that we had in the upstream business, it's still less than 6% of our business overall as compared to peak where it was almost to 11% of our business. So we're encouraged, we're pleased, we kept our footprint there to serve that market, but I don't think it's going to get as big as it did at one point in time in the history.","Steven Ramsey","Excellent. Thank you.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Matthew Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","William Plummer","Hey, David.","David Raso","Good morning. Within the overall guidance that you maintained the high level metrics, was there any change from the start of the year in your thought on rental rates and your thoughts on time utilization?","Michael Kneeland","No significant change. David as I mentioned before, I think the rate result in the first quarter is probably better than what we expected coming into it. And so that's a good starting point for the year. And we'll have to see how it develops from here. I think we feel good about the way that we've been able to position the fleet and the fleet on rent for the remainder of the year. There are some puts and takes in the utilization of that fleet in the first quarter. Matt touched on the margin particular, but nothing that\u2019s concerning to us as we look at the rest of the year. And as we said, I think April feels like it\u2019s positioning us well to continue to say that about the rest of the year.","David Raso","So that said, it seems like three months ago maybe there was an upward bios if there was going to be a change to your CapEx, but you chose to maintain the CapEx guidance at least at this point. Can you give us a little update on how you're thinking about the CapEx budget relative to those other two metrics? Obviously, the interests lie between all those three decisions?","William Plummer","Yes. It\u2019s certainly is an interplay. And what I would say is that we gave a pretty broad range for our gross capital spends this year, right. $150 million range. I think it gives us plenty of room to respond to the upside, if indeed it looks like we should be spending more. So I don't think we need to say that we're thinking any differently about our capital plan. It is still pretty early in the year to be talking about either increasing or decreasing for that matter. And so what I would say is let's have this conversation again at Q2 and we'll be able to make some more definitive statements about how the second quarter fleet on rent build and how that feels relative to our capital plan and we\u2019ll make it more definitive statement at that point.","David Raso","And the availability from your vendors to get ironed if you need it, just given some seasonality, it appears your CapEx was a little bit stronger in the first quarter than initially thought which for more months to utilize that bigger fleet it's good to get it early, but if there was a decision to add fleet, would you have ample availability to get it in time so to speak, if you wanted to in June, July, late May? Just coming to getting your feel from supply chain availability?","Matthew Flannery","Yes, David. This is Matt. We feel comfortable that we've got enough of a pipeline built that we could accelerate and move in some assets, so it would be more of an acceleration and then backfilling Q3 and Q4 is usually the way we do it when we make the decisions to change any capital either timing and\/or increase. And we believe we still have that flexibility and we're very fortunate to have good partners that understand keeping their share of United\u2019s business has value for both of us, and we give them as much foresight as we can.","David Raso","And what drove the decision or whatever caused a little more fleet coming in, in the first quarter than maybe was originally planned?","Matthew Flannery","Part of it is that we still felt the demand \u2013 first of all, we sold the decent amount of used equipment, number one. So when you look at net-net, our fleet size overall is not outside of where we expect it. We sold hair more and we replaced a hair more. We made an active decision throughout March not to slow down because we still saw the demand that was coming forward. We're talking to our customers and our field leaders and we didn't think there was any reason to slow down the flow in March because we expect to have a strong second quarter.","David Raso","Last, I am trying to understand what drove the decision? A strong used market, let's hit it and sell use, and then we need to backfill new? Or was it confidence in utilization to buy the new? Just want to make sure we understand what\u2019s driving what?","Michael Kneeland","So to be specific confidence in the overall balance, right, so sometimes, it gets parsed out time and rate too much. The overall balance of what time and rate is doing for us that we feel good about that. The answer was yes. Do we think our customer demand is going to be able to absorb the fleet that we\u2019re letting flow in not just in March, but we planned to bring in April, May, and June? And the answer was yes. So I would say those \u2013 really what we expected, the trend that we expected we just continued to flow.","David Raso","Okay. So it's a utilization confidence driving the fleet decision that wasn\u2019t\u2026","Michael Kneeland","Now let me touch on the used sale. So I know the first quarter looked a little lopsided. Much of that appearance had to do with accounting recognition, but we always sell our used equipment especially to vendors in Q1. It's the best time for us to get rid of older fleet and I said it earlier, but just remind you that the average age of that fleet that we sold to vendors in Q1 was 113 months. So when we\u2019re talking about 9 and 10 year old fleet. Q1 is a great time to get it out of the door because it's sitting in the branches. It's low peak season \u2013 low season time utilization and it easier for the branches to get it out during that period.","When we get busy into Q2, Q3, we're more focused on our retail, but our used sales as always strong to vendors in Q1. That's our opportunity to get it out and then on the back end in Q4 will get rid of some any remaining vendor sales that we had planned on it. That's kind of the way we've always operated our business. You guys just have between us been a bigger company and the accounting changes, it just probably gave a little bit of a different look from the outside world, but nothing changed internal.","David Raso","Thanks for the detail.","Michael Kneeland","Yes.","William Plummer","Thanks Dave.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Buckingham Research. Your question please.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi, guys.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Neil.","Neil Frohnapple","Bill, just to be clear on the [indiscernible] commentary you gave in response to Ross's question. So if you repeat the sequential rate improvement that you did over the last three quarters of last year that would take United the plus 2.9% for the full-year that's a pro forma basis, correct?","William Plummer","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. And are you seeing any other costs creep that's weighing on the incremental margin such as higher delivery costs that you call out or you have to manage through and I guess is the follow-up is there a risk that you'll see greater than previously anticipated equipment inflation due to higher steel costs, I think the vast majority of your purchase is under contract that you negotiate in the prior year but just want to confirm that? Thank you.","William Plummer","Thanks, Neil. On the cost question, I would point delivery cost in the quarter is something that has a focus from our management team. You guys have said this, you guys read the paper like we do and I'm sure you read about freight cost increases as fuels costs go up and as it becomes harder for the delivery companies to find track as well.","When we use outside hollers, we face some of those same dynamics in the quarter that's not to say that we didn't have opportunities to manage better, our use of outside haulers that something that we were very heavily focused on but that was the dynamic that\u2019s played out in Q1 and then that we're going to be focused on for the remainder of the year.","The other operating cost items I put in the category of just sort of normal management operations focus right of that. We had little bit more over time in the first quarter than maybe we expect to coming in, for example. Well, that's just something that we can put some management elbow grease to and address as we go forward.","So those are probably the cost items that I would say we're focused on right here now as for equipment purchase price inflation and commodity prices, our purchases, the vast majority of them are covered by supply agreement that have fixed pricing over the course of this year.","And so we would expect that the commodity prices won't drive very much in the way of inflation this year for us, obviously next year when we negotiate the terms for next year that will be a discussion point with the vendors and it will be a good old-fashioned arm wrestling match and we know how to do that and will do it vigorously from the time.","Neil Frohnapple","Great. Thanks very much Bill.","William Plummer","Thank you.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America, your question please.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, thanks guys. Just from that note the higher delivery costs over time \u2013 great equipment costs, lot of costs pressures out there. They've got to be impacting the smaller independent rentals chain is \u2013 in particular doesn't have your scale advantage. So are you seeing anything out in the field, which we believe that the smaller chains are almost being forced to raise prices higher than they might have otherwise going into the year, just to offset the cost inflation?","William Plummer","Ross, I don't know that I would could tie it directly to why they're making those decisions, but I would say what we're encouraged about is the industry seems to be acting as we are, right. The industry seen better rate improvement, the industry seen better time utilization.","So we see those as positive indicators and certainly costs pressures are something that everybody has to deal with right just merit increases and everything. So I would say you'd hope that informing them, but the result is what we can really comment on when the results are looking like the industry is acting in a responsible manner when it comes to rate and getting some time utilization.","Ross Gilardi","And any sense of just broader market acceptance for some of these equipment surcharges that have been announced by your aerial suppliers?","Matthew Flannery","I'm sure that those are being impacted by. I'm not opening their arms to it. But there's no real commentary that I could give you that would be \u2013 that I think would be that helpful for you.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks for that.","Michael Kneeland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Michael Kneeland","Hi, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger","Good morning. Mike or Matt, you mentioned a large projects that you're eyeing in late 2018 that should benefit 2019. Could you just give us some perspective maybe comparing it to past years, how sizable that looks, and your ability to win those, are they already in hand, are they bids to come and also just a feel for your win rate on bids, just if that's something you measure and something you can share? Thanks.","Matthew Flannery","Sure, Scott. So I'll just mention the win rate, it's something that we measure internally not something we talk about externally, but I would say as for as project pipeline, I specifically make comments about the industrial projects because that's a significant change on a year-over-year basis. We're seeing some nice industrial projects that are carrying over from last year, but that's pipeline seems to be increasing a little bit in the back half of 2018 on a year-over-year basis.","As far as commercial, I wouldn't tie just a major projects, I think it's broad geographically; broad by project mix and the demand is brought by product type and sector. Every vertical, every meaningful vertical that we track of end markets is up on a year-over-year basis. So the project commentary specifically that you heard was more about the back half of the year in the industrial sector, but overall I\u2019d say the pipeline is a strong and a little bit stronger in some areas this last year.","Michael Kneeland","The other thing I would add that is if you take a look at all key indicators, they\u2019re positive. And if you take a look at the associated builders and contractors, backlog in the fourth quarter expanded to [9.67] months, which is the highest level ever achieved. So in Dodge Momentum Index is positive. The highest level in cycle, I can take through all of these items, but the bottom line is all of the key indicators remain positive. And as Matt mentioned, it's very broad, nothing specific, but we have the footprint and we have the equipment and the people to tackle the task.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. I appreciate that. And just real quick here at the end, I'm envisioning you have a very large Specialty and Gen Rent pipeline and you don't size it, but just curious, obviously you have a great opportunity throughout North America? Are you looking at anything outside of North American and just contemplation of that? Thanks.","Michael Kneeland","Look, we've said at some point the company will look beyond when that time is, we haven't pinpointed an exact date, but I think the key point is, one, North America is very strong. There is still \u2013 we have \u2013 as far as market opportunities remain very high here for us to capture more and that's what we're doing and that's why when you take a look at the specialty businesses and the growth that we're seeing, that is really to me a no-brainer. Why would we go after the current market that we are in where we have the biggest strength, but going beyond North America at some point yes and more than likely with our customers.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks guys.","Matthew Flannery","Thanks Scott.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program.
