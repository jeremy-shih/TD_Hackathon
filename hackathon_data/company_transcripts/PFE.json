Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2016 performance and 2016 financial guidance. I'm joined today by: our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide R&D; Albert Bourla, President of Pfizer Innovative Pharma [GIP]; John Young, President of Established Pharma [GEP]; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 First Quarter 2016, which is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning as well as in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at their website, SEC.gov, and our website, Pfizer.com. The forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake to obligation to update or revise any of the statements.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, May 3, 2016. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website, Pfizer.com\/investors. Also, any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","We will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including: the expected pipeline development this year; our approach to business development in light of our decision not to move forward with Allergan; and the steps we expect to take to effect a potential split of the company.","2016 is off to a good start, with solid performance across both the Innovative and Established businesses. Notably, Prevnar 13, Ibrance, Eliquis, and Chantix are performing better than we initially projected. As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year-ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective.","We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even without that impact, exceeding our internal projections, and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE [Loss of Exclusivity] impact from Lyrica, Rebif, and Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes.","Overall, looking at the quarter on a revenue basis, Pfizer's standalone business excluding Hospira grew 15% operationally and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally and Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Xeljanz, Chantix, and Nexium 24-Hour, principally in the U.S.","Of particular note, Ibrance has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launching in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. And the feedback continues to be very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life.","Recently we announced that the confirmatory Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial for Ibrance in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival. Detailed results will be presented at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] in early June.","We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year over year.","For the Prevnar 13 Adult indication, while there was year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remained strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full-year 2016 will be comparable to 2015.","And we were pleased that the results of the EAGLES study, the largest global clinical trial of smoking cessation medicines, were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and bupropion with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. The authors concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers treated with Chantix had significantly higher quit rates than those treated with bupropion, nicotine patch, or placebo.","Turning now to our Established business, it grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the addition of revenues from legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from the sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of the Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the number one sterile injectables company globally. We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of difficult to manufacture sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position combined with our expanded biosimilars offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in emerging markets will help us to move the Established Pharmaceuticals business from a period of loss of exclusivity-driven decline to potential growth.","The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed the specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network. Based on Hospira's excellent strategic fit with our Established business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy target of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings.","As you are aware, in early April we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving inversions in the near term. While the outcome was disappointing, we always viewed the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged.","Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so that a greater proportion of our earnings per share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, Xeljanz, Ibrance, and Prevnar 13 Adult have now become meaningful revenue contributors.","In addition, the FDA's decision to approve Celltrion's biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold the exclusive commercialization rights of this product in the U.S. While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors, such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparations of our launch plans for 2016.","Our current biosimilars portfolio includes three commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S., Inflectra, Nivestim, and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity and for expanding patient access in important treatments. We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharma business in emerging markets, with a robust portfolio positioned to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in emerging markets increased 10% operationally this quarter, and companywide revenues in emerging markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base.","We also continue to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include: a planned submission for ulcerative colitis for Xeljanz, which is on track to occur in the first half of 2017; the acceptance for review of the Xeljanz EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab SPIRE-2 outcomes trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of a time-to-events trial, we currently anticipate a potential completion of this outcomes study in the second half of 2017.","Presentation of the ertugliflozin Phase 3 data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential registry filing in the U.S. The tanezumab Phase 3 program, where we are now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain, and cancer pain indications. A potential regulatory decision in the EU for Ibrance in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced metastatic breast cancer; and for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on next steps to bring this important medicine to patients.","Behind these assets is a strong and early mid-stage pipeline, most notably a broad portfolio of I-O compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets, eight of which are potentially registration-enabling. We continue to expect that the key advances in I-O will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy and ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm.","We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic, with our key combination assets being 4-1BB and OX-40. We also have a range of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our allogeneic CAR-T program in collaboration with Cellectis and Servier and a small molecule immunotherapy asset, IDO-1, in collaboration with iTeos, and our bispecific antibody, P-cadherin.","Recently, we presented Phase 2 data at the AACR [American Association for Cancer Research] annual meeting showing that Ibrance was effective in slowing the multiplication of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect our proof-of-concept readout with our next-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib, in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Lorlatinib is our investigational follow-on drug to Xalkori.","In neuroscience, we began a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's.","In addition, through a collaboration with MedGenesis Therapeutix, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's, and expect to have a proof-of-concept study readout in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF [Glial cell Derived Neurotrophic Factor] protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease-modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients.","In vaccines, we expect to have a C. difficile proof-of-concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile is a growing hard to treat infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease, and the infection control practices are challenging to implement. Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016.","Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from our distinct competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business. Each is led by strong leaders with the experience and knowhow to effectively direct and grow these organizations.","In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives, with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value; that have the potential for near-term solid value creation; that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets; and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas.","As you know, we're also considering a potential separation. Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these four questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as standalone entities? Is there trapped value in the combined entity, and can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we will be assessing our performance against each of these factors.","In summary, the business is performing well, driven by FAN (16:43) strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on our demonstrated ability to be innovative in the Established businesses to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates at every stage of the pipeline. And we have the financial flexibility and several options for creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Frank, and thank you.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include three months of legacy Hospira global operations compared with first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any legacy Hospira operations.","Now moving on to the financials, we had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to five additional selling days in the U.S. and four additional selling days in international markets in the first quarter of 2016 versus the year-ago quarter.","Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix, and the 14% operational growth in emerging markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity.","With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was a greater variability of selling days during the quarters in 2015 than there will be in 2016, but this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were five more U.S. and four more international selling days in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter, and there are four fewer U.S. and three fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full-year 2016 as in full-year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably for the first and fourth quarters.","Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of 2015, and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016; which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion, or 16%; $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments, and higher asset impairment charges.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7%, and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter.","The results for the GIP, VOC [Vaccines, Oncology & Consumer Healthcare], and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation that is posted on our website.","Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance, we are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 diluted adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30.","I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors such as our strong performance to date in 2016 in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016 favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06.","Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion.","Moving on to key takeaways, this quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer standalone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, such as Ibrance, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Lyrica, and additional selling days during the first quarter. As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, and improved business outlook for 2016.","We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian and Frank, for the prepared comments. Operator, can we please move to the question-and-answer session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I have a clarification and a two-part question, first the clarification. Frank, I just want to confirm that the guidance increase for the full year has nothing to do with selling days.","And then my two-part question, for John, when is the earliest biosimilar Remicade could be launched when you consider the legal and regulatory framework that exists today?","And then for Ian, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how the recent Treasury moves and your subsequent actions affect the decision to split or not to split. If you don't see obvious trapped value today based on your current structure and domicile, does your separation assessment consider the domicile and tax structure of other companies that could potentially maximize value for Pfizer shareholders? Thanks.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","So on the guidance, the guidance increase has nothing to do with the selling days. Think about it this way. Selling days in 2016 haven't changed since we issued our initial 2016 guidance on the last earnings call. So short answer is absolutely nothing to do with our improved guidance. It's really about the operational performance, the strong operational performance, and to a lesser extent foreign exchange.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Please, John.","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the question, Gregg. So in regard to Inflectra, launch timing will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including marketplace conditions, payer dynamics, expected timing for entry of other products, and intellectual property-related considerations, among others. Pursuant to a stipulation entered in a recent court conference related to ongoing litigation between Hospira, Celltrion, and Janssen, Hospira agreed not to sell Inflectra in the U.S. prior to the June 29, 2016 expiration of the Crohn's patent. We are moving ahead with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016, as you heard in Ian's comments, and we can't comment further beyond those points.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Gregg, the delay caused by \u2013 or the potential split caused by Allergan was just the structural work needed to be done to incorporate them in. That going away, it put us back on our original timeline, as we've continued to work on that as a standalone company. Now there are many factors we'll take into account in whether we want to split or not. And one of them is, of course, the tax structure of the two companies if they are split. And I think the Treasury action and the government's willingness to act in this area will make us think deeply about what are the alternatives to let part of this company, if possible, have a different tax jurisdiction.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, all. Can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Just to continue on that process, do you feel like you need to strengthen the Innovative business before you would break this company up, or are you pretty satisfied with the way it is right now? And if you do split up, can you give us your best estimate of what the dis-synergies would be?","And then just secondly, you mentioned on Prevnar there were government purchases. Can you quantify how much that helped in the quarter? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Marc, the dis-synergies, can we do that first?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","I can do dis-synergies. So, Marc, on dis-synergies, once again, assuming we were to exercise our option, and no decision has been made to date, it would be immaterial relative to overall earnings. Current estimates are a couple cents a share on an annualized basis. Obviously, we'll fine tune that as we go forward, but current estimates are a couple cents a share.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Prevnar, Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. On the Prevnar, there were some U.S. ordering partners this quarter. It's to the range of $40 million approximately.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. And the businesses I think are strong enough to be standalone businesses without ever any further BD. But either as separate companies or as one company, we'll always continue to look at doing BD when it's appropriate and when it can add value. And that would be an ongoing process either pre or post-split, I would imagine, from both companies' perspectives, but always with a focus of \u2013 strong focus on value on our part.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great, thank you. Can we move to the next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, thank you. I have two questions. First, Ian, I have a follow-up on an earlier question. And I apologize for being picky, but the fourth criteria for a split appears to have changed a bit. So previously, it was can the split be done in a tax-efficient way. And today, I believe you said can a split be done in an efficient way. So the word tax may have been deleted. Is this an accurate observation? The interpretation of it...","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","We're probably just simplifying the semantics. Efficient means efficient both operationally and from a tax perspective.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. The second question for Dr. Dolsten, it would appear that Pfizer is in the first wave of I-O combos. Now considering that Pfizer once studied tremelimumab, how big a disadvantage is it to Pfizer that you don't have access to a CTLA-4? Do you view CTLA-4 as here to stay, or will Pfizer's other targets make CTLA-4 obsolete, in your opinion? Thank you.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for the comment. I think CTLA-4 was the first of the immuno-oncology products. But as you know, its utility has been somewhat limited for both melanoma and combos because of its systemic immune activation, which can be quite demanding for oncologists to manage, although I'm sure that there will be growing knowledge of how to use the product. We are much more excited about the new checkpoint augmenting compounds like 4-1BB and OX-40 that seems to offer an ability to augment different parts of the immune system on top of likely PD-1 and PD-L1, but with retaining really promising tolerability. So we think that's the path to go, compounds that augment PD-1\/PD-L1 but retain the favorable tolerability. And that's really our focus and there are really no regrets.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jay Olson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, it's Jay Olson on for Jami Rubin. Thanks for taking the question. Just with regard to the GEP business and the four criteria that you gave to determine whether or not to separate the GEP business in particular, can you give us an idea of what sort of metrics you plan to use to measure the performance of GEP within Pfizer and the potential performance outside of Pfizer? And then similarly, what kind of metrics will you use to determine how much trapped value there is within GEP and how efficiently that could be untrapped? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. The metrics from inside Pfizer will be of course their growth in their operations against our budgets. Outside of Pfizer, we'll try and establish similar-like companies. It would be easier for the Innovative business. It's not as easy for the Established because really the Established business is a unique business, including strong sterile injectables, strong biosimilar capabilities, and big emerging markets. And it's not really a generic business, so it's very hard to find a comparison there, but I'm sure we'll be able to find some composite.","On whether we can unleash where there's trapped value, we'll obviously use outside advisors. But one of the classic methods would simply be to look at the sum of the parts as much as we can establish it by disaggregating our business the same ways we give you information to do. So we can take those businesses and compare them to standalone businesses and see what a potential valuation will be with the parts and compare it to the sum. That is one way of looking at their trapped value.","Another is to look historically at what has happened to companies where they're spun or where they have been spun in an unforced manner; i.e., because of management's decision and not because of activist pressure, and see what has happened to the shares of those companies subsequently. And of course, we'll also have to look at what are the tax implications, which really circles back to standalone abilities if companies are disadvantaged in a more specific way because of their tax situation compared to their competitors.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple of questions, please. My understanding is that right before the Allergan deal was terminated, maybe a week before or something like that, Pfizer went through a round of layoffs of various folks at that mid-management level in anticipation of the merger. And obviously earlier in the year, Geno Germano left. So now with the deal off, I'm wondering what the plan is from here in terms of filling these types of positions. Are you, for example, calling out folks that were going to leave and asking them to stay on for now, or what? I'm trying to understand what sort of disruption this might have caused unexpectedly.","And second question on splitting up, how much of a drag internally is there to do this? My understanding is that because of different reasons, there is an internal desire by a lot of Pfizer folks at that mid-manager level to separate the organization. I'm not sure if you have town hall meetings or that sort of thing. But what's the feedback internally at the rank-and-file level on the company splitting up?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Tim, so I'm really not aware of any layoffs or major changes prior to the Allergan deal. I think there were certain specific positions that may have been reorganized. But to answer your question succinctly, there is no disorganization or disruption. I think the results of the first quarter show that, so I'm not at all worried about that.","And as to the internal conversations, I would say they're very robust. We have a great enterprise-wide view on the company that stems from John's leadership in Established and his team. And the internal decisions or internal motivations are totally directed to what we believe would be best for shareholder value, and it's a very transparent process. So I don't think there are in any way factions within the company trying to push one way or the other. We're all focused as a management team on what the best decision for Pfizer shareholders would be. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the question. I just had two on business development. I guess the first one is can you just elaborate on your priorities and appetite at this point? I guess as part of that, do you have a bias when it comes to bolstering Innovative versus Established? And is there a focus on in-market or near-to-market products versus pipeline?","The second question was about the competitive environment for business development. I know you've been very financially disciplined in the past, but it appears that we've got a pretty competitive environment out there, and some of your peers may be less focused on ROI than you are. How do you balance that opportunity to acquire attractive assets with maximizing long-term shareholder value in this environment? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Our BD approach has always been one of BD is not a strategy. It complements our ongoing strategies. So I think our BD post-Allergan remains on that same course. We'll look for assets that we think can add value to shareholders that are appropriately priced and meet our returns. We've always been very disciplined on that, although not concerned about pulling the trigger when we see those opportunities.","So I think there is \u2013 after all the work we've done on the Established side, there would be a tendency towards a bias to the Innovative side. And we would be biased I think more towards products that are near-market or in-market that we believe we could generate incremental growth and value by owning them rather than looking at very early products because we think we have a very full and complete pipeline in that area. On the competitive stance, I'd ask Frank to make a few comments on that.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sure. So I think, Chris, the way to think about this, at least the way we think about this, is clearly there has been some changes in valuation in sectors within the industry. So biotech, for example, clearly has had a change in valuation, a decrease in valuations. Without speaking for those management teams or those boards, I think at a macro level, if you were to ask do they believe that their current valuations represent the valuations of the company, I'd say I'm not sure. I think that they're probably in transition, that they really haven't decided that that most of the latest valuations are indeed the valuations that are real valuations. What I always believe is what really will determine this are when those individual companies have to go out and have a capital market event. The capital market event will be very informing in terms of what the valuations of those companies are. And so I think over time we'll see some of that thinking take place.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. So first question, just on Chantix, on the EAGLES results that you got, is that going to help to relax the need to mention neuropsychiatric side effects on direct-to-consumer advertising ads? And we're already seeing a nice uptick, but if you're able to relax that, one would think that you might be able to see a faster uptick.","Second question on GEP, you've indicated that you're going to be divesting the pumps business. Where are you in the process on identifying a financial or strategic buyer for the pumps business? And one of your competitors announced this morning that they're going to spinning their hemophilia business. Any thoughts within the Innovation core to possibly considering staying and\/or divesting businesses that aren't receiving enough R&D attention that could be better as standalone businesses out of that Innovation core? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Albert, if you could, talk about Chantix, please.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, obviously, I'm very pleased with the positive results of EAGLES. In this monumental study, the authors concluded, as Ian said, that the trial did not see a significant increase of first year's neuropsychiatric adverse events with Chantix or bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine patch. We are submitting this data to various regulatory bodies, proposing revisions to the product labeling, including a request for the removal of a boxed warning. We believe that the available scientific evidence does not support the boxed warning, and to look forward to discussing this data with FDA, EMA and other global regulatory parties.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. I would just add that also having it published in The Lancet is clearly a good medical communication and education and will allow an appropriate dialogue. John?","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question, John. So maybe I just wanted to correct any misunderstanding that may be out there because we've made no announcement regarding any intention to do anything in regard to our pump or Infusion Systems business. We're obviously aware of market speculation, which we don't comment on. Across all of our businesses, we regularly review our business portfolio from the perspective of maximizing value creation. If there are any developments with our business, we would certainly communicate that publicly. But I think as we've said previously, we believe that in the Hospira acquisition we acquired what is a scarce asset that is performing well. The management team have taken the right steps to turn the business around, and we are extremely positive about the opportunity to continue to help the Infusion Systems business to perform well and to return to growth.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And, Frank, if you could, talk about the...","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Hemophilia?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Hemophilia, I think it was hemophilia.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Yes, so obviously, John, we're aware of the announcement this morning on the hemophilia business of one of our competitors. The way I think about this is we've done similar things in the past. If you think about our sale of Capsugel, the sale of Nutri [Nutrition], the creation of Zoetis, and I think our compass on all those transactions has been creating shareholder value. Our compass going forward will continue to be creating shareholder value. If we think there's an opportunity to do that through any action, including something like a spin, we would clearly consider it. Hopefully, our actions in the past have demonstrated that we have more than a willingness to do that.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Hello, thanks very much for the question, so I just had a couple here. First off, can you talk a little bit about the expectations for biosimilar product launches outside the U.S. and how you see them evolving relative to Inflectra's launch, which seems to have been ahead of expectations?","The second question is relative to international Enbrel. Is Inflectra uptake and Remicade pricing a good comparison for Enbrel's performance as biosimilars hit the market in the next call it eight to 12 months?","And then the last question is on consumer. On the recent GlaxoSmithKline conference call, when asked about interest in additional consumer assets and the possibility of interest in Pfizer's consumer business, the current CEO suggested that they continue to evaluate all options and would welcome opportunities to participate in these larger assets. I guess my question is how creative are you willing to get with the consumer business in order \u2013 and would a ViiV-like deal be ever a consideration for the consumer business at Pfizer? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So thank you, Seamus. I'll deal with the consumer one first. Look, the consumer asset in Pfizer's portfolio is a very valuable asset. It's growing well. We're continuing to add to that business. We have a great management team. That being said, all of Pfizer is aware internally that we continually look at all of our different assets, and we're always focused on creating shareholder value. To this date or to this moment, I think the best way of creating shareholder value is the plan we have with consumer growing inside Pfizer. But as facts change, we're always willing to look at those facts. If you could, deal with the biosimilars, John, please.","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Yes, so thanks for the question, Seamus. So clearly, biosimilars are a very important part of the GEP growth strategy. The portfolio consists of both Pfizer, legacy Pfizer and legacy Hospira assets as well as some assets from external partnerships. Per your question, we remain very bullish about the opportunity. There's something on the order of $100 billion of currently patented branded biologics expected to lose patent protection in the next five to 10 years. And the global market for biosimilars is expected to grow from around $1 billion annually in 2013 to somewhere on the order of $17 billion to $20 billion in 2020.","In regard to our plans for our portfolio, we have overall around nine distinct biosimilar molecules in different stages of development and approval. We're going to look to optimize the launch of that portfolio on a global basis over the coming years.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, could you discuss the impact on Enbrel?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, first of all on the pricing, let me say that I don't think we can draw conclusions from one biosimilar to the other. Every one has its own dynamic. From the limited pricing for Enbrel biosimilar so far, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive.","Now in a general comment on the performance of biosimilars, so far Enbrel had a strong quarter of 8% up, so basically no impact to date from biosimilars, but of course it's very early. We do expect a modest uptake of biosimilars. But due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, at launch we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Ian, I appreciate your comments regarding you'll make a decision on a potential split-up by the end of 2016. Can you confirm or not confirm that that decision would be a yes or no that you would split by the end of 2017, or should we be extending our timeline for the actual timing of a split?","And then number two, I know you've given this before, Frank. But can you just comment roughly speaking on what you see the go-forward growth rates for both the growth business and the Established Products business mean? I think you've given us a ballpark figure for that. I know there's no official guidance out there. But just a ballpark figure, it would be nice to get those ballparks refreshed.","And then finally, you had made some commentary, Frank, around \u2013 I think you had made some commentary around the leverage ratio that the Allergan Pfizer NewCo, you'd be willing to take the Allergan Pfizer NewCo to. I was just wondering. Now that obviously Allergan isn't going to be part of the future, what kind of leverage ratio you guys would go to, to maximum and whether or not you would be willing to take out debt in order to do a large share repurchase? Thanks a lot.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on the timing of the split, if we made a decision to split in the fourth quarter, we believe that the transaction could be completed by the end of 2017. Obviously, those timelines are subject to change if we encounter things that we don't expect in the process. But right now, the planning assumption would be with a fourth quarter decision, we would be able to complete the transaction by the end of 2017. Frank, do you want to handle the other question?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sure. So on the going-forward growth rates, I haven't provided going-forward growth rates other than our 2016 guidance for revenue, which we just increased by $2 billion, $1 billion of which was operational.","On the leverage ratio, what I've said previously, Mark, on that is I'd be willing to take it to 2.5 to three times. We mentioned that as part of when we've gone through some of the Allergan meetings. So by the way, if I was willing to do it for that, I'd be willing to do it for the right transaction on a going-forward basis.","In terms of leveraging the balance sheet for buybacks, the way I think about this is if you go back to 2010, and if you include the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase that we added this past March, $50.7 billion of share buybacks, $50.7 billion, 1.9 billion shares excluding the 405 million shares as a result of the Zoetis exchange. So we've done actually a massive buyback without having to borrow or leverage the balance sheet, which allows us to keep our powder dry if we wanted to do a different kind of transaction. So hopefully that answers your question.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Operator, can we move on to the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. With respect to considerations for Established Products, could you just comment on how you're considering potentially shifting Viagra and Lyrica from the Innovative segment to Established Products?","Second, could you just discuss your plans to launch a biosimilar Remicade in the U.S. this fall and your level of conviction there?","And then third, could you help us understand how we should think about Prevnar comps going into next winter? Obviously, Prevnar has been extremely strong, but that may present tough comps a year from now. So any color on your thinking there would be helpful. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, so we would expect that we will continue with our policy to move products like Viagra and Lyrica as they get close to be peri-LOEs from one business to the other. The exact timing we would decide. But in general, you clearly want to have an Innovative company that is focused on growth and not focused on managing the end cycles of products like Lyrica and Viagra.","On the biosimilar Remicade, I really think John has made comments on that, and we really can't add any more than that. I wouldn't say that we are preparing for a 2016 launch, and it's dependent upon the factors that John has already mentioned. And, Albert, on the Prevnar comps.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, let's start at the top. In the U.S., we said we had operational growth of 28%. So apparently, we continue to do an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity. But to put it into context, as of the end of the quarter, from the 49 million adults eligible for vaccination, we have already covered 37% of them. In fact, the vast majority previously vaccinated was new ones (51:45). As we have said before, while many adults remain, this cohort is much more difficult to capture. And going forward, we expect the U.S. adult revenues to decline compared to last year. These will be partially offset by Europe and the rest of the world, which achieved 63% operational growth this quarter and will continue growing strongly. And also, as both Ian and Frank said in the beginning, the adopting pediatric will have a strong performance. So as a whole, the Prevnar franchise will have very comparable revenues this year compared to last year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thank so much for taking my questions. So two on the immuno-oncology side, so one just on avelumab. I believe Merkel cell you mentioned as the lead registrational indication there. I'm wondering if you have that data in-house now. And are you still confident in getting that filed an accelerated manner? And if you could just clarify, between yourselves and Merck KGaA, how the registration process works, who's in charge of that, or is it done jointly?","And then second on the combination side, you mentioned 4-1BB and OX-40 being two of the key agents as you think about combinations. Can you just talk a little bit about how you prioritize those two, given it seems like several companies have OX-40s in early development, while 4-1BB it appears it's just you and maybe one or two other competitors? I'm trying to get a sense of how important having something that is unique or differentiated to offer physicians and payers for combinations could be going forward when you think about how to prioritize resources behind the two different agents. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. I'll ask Albert to talk about the Merkel cell and the registration split of responsibilities. And then Mikael can deal with the choices we make between our unique 4-1BB and our OX-40.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, with regards to Merkel cell, first of all we are going to have some data presented at ASCO this year. It will be an oral presentation. We have already received Breakthrough designation, and we plan to file this year. The work between us and Merck KGaA is split in a very collaborative way. They are doing parts of the work and we are doing other parts, and we have very good collaboration. So we are very confident on executing on that.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, so both our 4-1BB and OX-40 have unique design versus major competitors. And as you know, our 4-1BB has performed very well when it comes to tolerability. And we already reported last ASCO of augmenting effect when combined with rituximab, and we'll start reporting early signs when combined with PD-1 and PD-L1 this year. So we do think that 4-1BB will be a key molecule as the performance we start to see. We are the only company that can put a 4-1BB\/OX-40\/PD-L1 in place, and we're moving swiftly to have that as an option, and expect late this year or early next year to have that triple combo.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, and can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. On potential competition to Ibrance, there's increasing optimism on the Street around Lilly's CDK-4\/6, and I guess we'll see data on that at ASCO. Could you just discuss how you view Lilly's and Novartis's CDK-4\/6 in terms of their level of threat to Ibrance going forward?","Second, on the Xeljanz filing in the EU, what's your level of confidence that this will get through, and what you feel you satisfied in this submission that previously had been lacking?","And then lastly, just in your earlier-stage pipeline, any assets you would highlight that you're particularly excited about that we should be paying closer attention to? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. I think why don't we ask Mikael to deal with the early assets that we're excited about and perhaps also comment on the Xeljanz submission, and then Albert may want to add something. And then Albert will deal with the Ibrance competitive situation.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you. So we have a very comprehensive pipeline. As you heard, Ian alluded to that in his prepared remarks. We have 85 projects spread across Phase 1 to Phase 3 registration. And let me just mention a couple that we think will be really unique and differentiating. We already touched base on 4-1BB, on OX-40, and the triple I-O combo. Lorlatinib in the ALK and ROS space is generating very interesting data that we will start to share. We have a novel ADC called PTK-7 that we'll also see some real interesting response rates. In the immuno- inflammation field, in addition to Xeljanz, we now have four different immuno-kinases going into Phase 2, with several highly specific JAKs going to inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological inflammation, and lupus. So we will share more data around those, but I think that will really move the entire JAK field over time into new areas and with the new profiles.","Vaccines, it's always CDs and stuff (57:40) obviously that we are really excited about. And Ian mentioned in his introduction that we have built some interesting assets in Parkinson's with a completely novel dopamine modulator, and also have an interesting GDNF study together with MedGenesis.","And finally, in rare disease, I'll exemplify that we have a growing sickle cell franchise with rivipansel and a plan to start PD-9 as a way to prevent occurrence of difficult-to-treat rare disease episodes. So you can see our opportunity spans multiple therapeutic areas.","Xeljanz in Europe I think is based on a very comprehensive file. We have six complete clinical trials with two open-label extensions. And all our program contains more than 19,000 patients here, more than 6,000 patients in long-term extension up to eight years. And please, I want to just to remind everyone that Xeljanz has been used by more than 6,500 physicians and more 50,000 patients in the U.S. with a very favorable profile. So you can see it's a completely different profile we have now with the European regulatory agencies. And we also have some specific sub-studies that we're interested on that we have executed on. So we view the dialogue with them as very constructive at this moment.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","I have nothing to add in Xeljanz, just maybe that it is already approved in more than 45 countries. And let me move to Ibrance and competition. I cannot really speak much about competition, but it includes Lilly and Novartis because there is limited clinical data in the public domain on the efficacy and safety. What I can do is I can speak about our product, and I can tell you we have the most advanced and broad program in the industry. Firstly, we are the only company with a registered product in the U.S. and eight other countries and an accepted filing in Europe where we may obtain registration this year. In just over a year in the market, Ibrance has been prescribed by almost 7,000 physicians and is up to more than 28,000 patients.","This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and outstanding safety profile with a very low rate of global three and four GI effects such as fatigue and diarrhea. Ibrance has delivered positive results across three randomized pivotal trials. It's been studied in an additional five pivotal studies in early, advanced, and recurrent breast cancer as well as 62 ongoing investigator-initiated research, 38 of which are in breast cancer and 28 are in non-breast cancer. So this is what I call a clear lead.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Three questions, please. First, Ian, you touched upon triple combinations, or it may have been Mikael. There's obviously a significant cost burden attached with that. Could you talk to the idea of where you feel specialist care pricing is going in the U.S. and how quickly is biosimilars' cost effectiveness arguments in a gridlocked House sufficient to maintain the status quo, or how do you anticipate and how quickly do you anticipate change?","Second on PBMs, again to Ian, some of your peers have identified PBMs as bad actors in the whole healthcare value chain given their disproportionate rebate capture. Do you believe that PBMs or rather pricing transparency is a good or a bad thing from an industry perspective?","And then finally for Mikael, I saw some data recently on Selzentry, your CCR5 antagonist, in an immuno-oncology setting. Do you have any plans to develop that drug within that setting, or is the IP an issue? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on the pricing oncology assets, clearly products are sold on their value and the value of the patients and those of society, but there is also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime like with Pfizer's case the PD-L1, the OX-40, the 4-1BB, or a small molecule will enable offerings to payers that I think society will find acceptable from a cost\/benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all those elements separately in the marketplace.","On pricing itself, I agree with you. There is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year. And there is concern from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plans that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more of benefit administrators than insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion. But I expect that in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion, but I do think in the end that's where the United States will end up in that discussion.","On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on and they're serving a valid market function, as the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace to ensure it works, and I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really all I can really comment on that. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael is supposed to talk about Selzentry.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael, yes.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","I think you were likely referring to our CCR2 small molecule antagonist. And we have together with an academic collaborator really observed some interesting effects on suppressive immune cells in pancreatic cancer and some early encouraging clinical signals. So we do continue with a second study in pancreatic cancer with the CCR2. And in total, we currently have eight different new medical entities in the immuno-oncology field in the clinic, and expect by the end of this year to have 10 different immuno-oncology compounds in the clinic.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, just a couple. Ian, can you continue the strategy discussion? I want to get a sense as to what at this point you'd characterize as the top one or two priorities post-Allergan and when you look at things like tax rate, cash flow, expected multiples, or growth rates.","And then just on the pipeline front, a few for Ibrance, the adjuvant trials really aren't until much later, say 2020. But how do you see the role of CDK-4\/6 in this, and does your long-term thinking assume success here? And then for boco [bococizumab] in PCSK9, clearly, outcomes data are going to dictate the share. But much of a role do you think that imaging plays through IVUS [intravascular ultrasound] in product differentiation? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. The priorities post-Allergan continue to be our four strategies, which is to continue to show excellence in our Innovative core and bring forward Innovative products. I think you've seen us do that. Continue to drive the growth rates of our inline and newly launched products, which you can see are happening. Eliquis is performing extremely well, with an LOE in the United States out I think in 2019 \u2013 sorry, Lyrica that is. Eliquis is doing very well. Xeljanz is doing well.","So I think the priorities are: continue to ensure that our science comes to market; grow our inline products, which I think we're doing well; execute on capital discipline, which we continue to do; and in our Established Products businesses is to roll out successfully the biosimilar strategy, to continue to utilize and maximize the value of our sterile injectables around the world. So frankly, I think there is lots to do in that area. We'll continue to look at our tax situation. We have a very good tax group, and Frank and his team are very good at looking at how to improve that. It continues to be an area of focus.","Vis-\u00e0-vis Ibrance, I agree with you that the trials are on the timelines you talk about, but that's the nature of the trials in oncology. And the reality is we have already started those trials and are well ahead of any of our competition. So it's a matter of a lead established in the marketplace. So I'm very optimistic about the long-term growth rates of Ibrance, both in the indications it has now and the indications to come as we go earlier in the breast cancer. And also outside of breast cancer I think we have a lot of work going on. And then you asked \u2013 the last question was?","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Boco, PCSK9.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Boco, I've always thought, and we discussed this, that boco, or these products should only have been launched when you have outcomes data. I've always felt, and I think if you go back in our transcripts, we've always said that on LDL alone, it will be difficult to convince society to pay what's necessary, and you really need to include along with LDL in the outcomes. So clearly outcomes is important. Imaging has been used previously with lipid agents. It doesn't really move the needle. What moves the needle is the large prospective trials which show that outcomes are changed. And an image just doesn't do the same as that data. So I look forward to that class expanding when we have the outcomes data and we have the right value equation for society.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Manoj Garg from Healthco.","Manoj K. Garg - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, one for Albert on Ibrance and then just one for Frank on financials. When would you expect submitting the PALOMA-2 data to FDA? And then maybe you can just talk about what that would do to the intent-to-treat population. And then just to follow up there, what is the general timing in Europe on approval?","And then for Frank, on the $500 million increase in SI&A, is that driven largely by FX, or is there some additional investment there?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Go ahead, Albert, please.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. As you know, we announced positive top line results from PALOMA-2. We will present details at ASCO with an oral presentation. It will be a late-breaker. Now this trial provides additional confirmatory evidence on the benefits of Ibrance for breast cancer patients. So this will add to the momentum, obviously. Also, it will be used for regulatory filings. It is a requirement from FDA so that we can convert the accelerated approval to a permanent approval, and we plan to file. We are in discussions now with the FDA.","In EU we have already filed. We have an accepted filing based on PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-3. But also we have submitted already PALOMA-2 over there as additional supporting data. And as we said before, we expect to receive Ibrance approval in the U.S. as early as this year if eventually...","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Europe.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Excuse me, in Europe as early as this year if we have a positive opinion from European authorities.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","And on the SI&A and the impact of FX, so we took it up $500 million. The midpoint went up $500 million. Approximately half of that is due to foreign exchange. Approximately half of it is due to operations, including increased investment in new and certain inline products.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks, guys. I've got three questions. Firstly for Albert, can you update us on your thoughts on how Prevnar penetration into the adult indication is likely to play out over the next 12 months in Europe? Secondly, also for Albert, can you give us an update on how well the adjuvant breast cancer studies are enrolling?","And then thirdly, perhaps for Mikael, also on Ibrance, whether you see it largely restricted to the ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer setting, or whether its mechanism ultimately gets used for other metastatic tumors too? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay, Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, let me start with Europe. As I said, in Europe we have 63% operational growth, and this will continue. We will have strong growing in Europe. The demographics are very favorable over there. We have a larger eligible population. But the price per dose is less than in the U.S. And also another factor is that we need to obtain a recommendation. And this is a process that in Europe can take \u2013 recommendation and reinvestment \u2013 can be phased over two years because it's happening country by country. In some cases, within the same country it's happening district by district. So we are working very, very intensively on that because we see the opportunity as a major one.","But moving to how we are doing with our expansion into other breast cancer segments and particularly into the adjuvant setting actually, we have two studies in the adjuvant setting. That's PENELOPE-B. This is for high-risk early breast cancer, and we have PALLAS for intermediate-risk early breast cancer. And they are recruiting very nicely right now. I need to also emphasize that we have another one which is in pilot. It is a collaborative study, but it is in the neo-adjuvant setting with collaboration with the Washington University.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So we are increasingly excited as we have learned more about Ibrance how significant we can see opportunity to expand utility or potential of that drug. So we have studies ongoing, and we will likely see some data this year or next year in head and neck cancer in combination with Erbitux Pfizer-sponsored and collaborative studies, in Mantle cell lymphoma with ibrutinib, and in pancreatic cancer in combination with abraxane in 2017. And more recently, we're also studying EGFR mutant lung cancer combining Ibrance with our own PF7775 EGFR inhibitor.","Also within breast cancer, we see opportunities and have initiated triple therapy based on Ibrance, as well as we're looking at the novel segment of breast cancer that may go from ER into double-positive segments. So substantial opportunities and of course our antigen (1:14:25) is growing as we see how well Ibrance is performing. The patient experience is so good and our confirmatory studies deliver real encouraging data.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter, three questions, if I may. Ian, on business development, all things being equal, would you prefer ex-U.S. assets so that you can deploy your capital more efficiently? Second, apologies if I missed this, but can you tell us what Prevnar Adult sales were in the quarter by U.S., ex-U.S. if possible? And then finally on the Hospira business, it was a little bit lower than we expected despite the higher selling days. Could you comment on that, and is it because your own sterile injectable business is doing better? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. On the question of U.S. or non-U.S., as I said, we're value investors, so it comes down to what is the return on assets and what's the NPV. And of course, in that would be included the different costs of doing either an onshore or offshore deal. So we would make that decision based on that. Next, I think it's Mikael. Sorry, Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, Prevnar Adult global sales were $439 million, so that was 31% of that. But most of that was in the U.S., $390 million were in U.S. and $47 million were internationally. International, as I said, grew 63%.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And the last question","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Was global Hospira sales?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yes.","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","So overall we're very positive about the performance of the Hospira business. We saw positive performance across all of our segments this quarter with sterile injectables, biosimilars, and the infusion system. This business continues to return to growth overall. In addition, with the ongoing efforts to integrate the two companies that are ongoing but proceeding very well and in line with our plans, we remain very positive about the performance that we're seeing from the legacy Hospira business.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","And we increased our synergy target from $800 million to $1 billion.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank, for the add.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks. And, operator, can we take our last question, please?","Operator","Your final question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first off, can you help us think about the potential investor positioning for GEP to help us think about valuations? You say there aren't good comps out there, but I would tend to think of this as perhaps a slower growing part of the business but perhaps one that could sustain a greater dividend than the rest of the business over time. So just help us think. Is that the investor positioning of that business?","Secondly, on Ibrance, I wonder if you could just on the basis for the U.S. what's the duration of therapy that you're seeing and what's the market share in the unlabeled population?","And then just last question, have you prioritized any specific tumor types or indications yet for either 4-1BB or OX-40 in terms of pivotal planning? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On GEP, I've always used the analogy that it's like the pharmaceutical business that really given it's in sterile injectables to sell on quality and barriers to entry; and given its biosimilars which also will be eventually sold on the quality of the manufacturer and the data we have. And then the emerging markets, which is sold on brands and quality that it looks like a consumer business with just a touch more risk than a normal consumer business, so perhaps some nice comparables. The P\/Es really ought to be the consumer-like business. Now you may or may not agree with that, but it's slower growing, growing with GDP just like consumer businesses do, being sold on brands, and then a little more affected because it does have pricing risks and some development risks. That's how I would look at it. Ibrance?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, the first-line market there is now 38%. That's number one. We have achieve leadership and we have surpassed AI monotherapy. The second and third-line markets there are 26% and 14% respectively. But when it comes to duration of treatment, it's too early to assess because as you know, the product has been launched a year approximately ago, and PFS duration from the data it is around 20 months since PALOMA-2. So still we need some time to assess what would be the actual progression-free.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. So on one hand with 4-1BB, we presented last year at ASCO and we will provide update during this year, 4-1BB with rituximab being lymphoma that had very promising response rate in refractory with rituximab patients about 35%. We have expanded that study. It looks certainly very promising. So that could be one opportunity for moving 4-1BB fast forward. 4-1BB and OX-40 are expressed in many tumors in the immune infiltrating cells. So we will have a broad ambitious program where we see opportunity for these across many different solid tumors and some blood related cancers.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Let me make a correction. I think I said 20 months in PALOMA-2. It is 20 months in PALOMA-1. We haven't disclosed the duration treatment of PALOMA-2. We'll do that at ASCO.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Right.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sir.Chuck TrianoThank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2012 performance.I\u2019m joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Establish Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer Business; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at our home page at pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer quarterly corporate performance, fourth quarter 2012 located in the Investor Presentations Section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8K.The discussions during this call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 29, 2013.In addition, we will offer some brief comments regarding the potential IPO of a minority stake in our Animal Health business, Zoetis. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand we\u2019re not going to be able to respond to questions on that subject in light of the quiet period imposed by the securities laws.With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read.Ian Read Thank you, Chuck and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning I will briefly recap the progress we made in 2012 improving the performance of our innovative core and in creating value for our shareholders. I\u2019d also discuss our focus 2013.2012 was a year of very strong operational financial performance especially given our LOE challenges. We drove operational growth in many of our key products in the patent protected portfolio including Lyrica, Enbrel, Prevnar 13, Celebrex and Sutent. Operationally Emerging Markets grew 12%, animal health grew 6% and the consumer business grew 8%.Also during 2012 we executed on our plans allocating capital in ways that it enhance shareholder value. We reduced our total adjusted cost of sales SI&A and R&D expenses on an operational basis by approximately 10%, which is nearly a $4 billion reduction versus 2011 levels.We realized significant value for our shareholders through the sale of our Nutrition business to Nestl\u00e9 for $11.85 billion, and we\u2019re on track subject to market conditions to unlock value from our Animal Health business by completing our IPO Zoetis in the near future, and we returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Our focus on creating and productive and sustainable innovative course is yielding results. Our fourth quarter was highlighted by two important product approvals, Xeljanz in the U.S. and Eliquis in the U.S, Canada the EU and Japan. Along with our time at Bristol-Myers Squibb we\u2019re looking forward to launching Eliquis in the U.S. shortly, and believe its strong clinical profile can establish this medication as an important new treatment option in the high need area of stroke prevention for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.Our Specialty Care business is in the initial phase of launching Xeljanz in the U.S., a first-in-class compound with a compelling clinical profile and oral dosing. We believe these factors will position us competitively within the moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis market.We are prepared to invest in both of these products at competitive levels to support their launches. In addition to Xeljanz and Eliquis, during 2012 we received approval for three additional new medicines in light of advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S., the EU and Japan, Bosulif for CML in the U.S. and Eleyso for Gaucher disease in the U.S.During the year, we also advanced our early and mid-stage pipeline most notably in oncology and vaccine areas. We move forward in Phase 3 studies with dacomitinib for non-small cell lung cancer and inotuzumab for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.We reported encouraging Phase 2 data from our CDK 46 inhibitor for advanced breast cancer. This asset formally known as PD-332991 is now palbociclib. We commenced a Phase 3 study for inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and we began a Phase 3 study for meningitis B vaccine for individuals aged 11 to 25. I believe we are entering 2013 with one of the most robust pipelines in the company's recent history.The actions we set in motion early in 2011 to improve R&D productivity are starting to bear results and we look forward to additional progress June 2013. We have a pipeline that I believe includes high-value assets at all stages of the development continuum across our key therapeutic areas.As of late last year, our pipeline contained a total of 78 programs including 59 new molecular entities. There were 17 programs in Phase 3 clinical testing and eight in registration. Throughout 2012, we concentrated on advancing our pipeline, reducing our cost structure and returning value to our shareholders. I believe that through the dedication and focus of Pfizer colleagues, we have delivered on each of these goals.Turning to 2013, as I've discussed with you on previous calls, we have two distinct operating models within the developed markets. One model supports our innovative driven business; primary care, specialty care and oncology. The second model supports our value-driven business that comprises the off patent products within our Established Products unit.In terms of the Emerging Markets, our operational model has a geographic focus that supports both, the innovative driven and the value driven business. This is working well in these high growth geographies. That said, as these markets evolve, we will evaluate if our Emerging Markets operating model should more closely mirror the two distinct approaches we have for developed markets.The Consumer Healthcare business continues to be important as we pursue Rx to OTC Switch opportunities. We believe these are the right models for achieving the best performance for Pfizer over the next several years. During this time, we will be able to focus on the market success of our new products, advance our early and mid-stage pipeline, drive continued growth in Emerging Markets in both our innovative and all patent portfolio.Additionally, we'll have put behind us our most significant LOEs. We will also continue to use business development opportunities to supplement both our research and internal product efforts. Our primary focus remains both on acquisitions that are projected to meet or exceed the return on investment of share repurchases.More specifically in 2013, you will see us focused on continuing to maximize the value of our in-line portfolio including key in-line assets such as Lyrica, Celebrex, Enbrel, Viagra and Prevnar 13; maximizing the performance of the products approved in the last two years; continuing to advance the mid-to-late stage pipeline in vaccines, oncology, cardiovascular information; focusing on the high-growth, high-margin off-patent opportunities; focusing opportunities in key growth markets such as China, Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey and Mexico; continuing to work on managing our expenses and driving ongoing efficiencies within our manufacturing network so we have a lower and flexible cost base that allows us to respond to pricing pressures and our upcoming LOEs; and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.In summary, our results in 2012 demonstrated that we\u2019re focused on the right areas and are making visible progress towards sustained value creation. In 2013 we must maintain our momentum by continuing to execute by delivering on the potential within our pipeline and by demonstrating fiscal responsibility in how we use our capital. We are committed to helping patients by delivering innovative medicines and creating value for our shareholders.Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank, for additional details on the quarter and our 2013 financial guidance.Frank D'AmelioThanks, Read, and good day everyone. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to again remind you that the Nutrition business is presented as a discontinued operation in consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. As you know, discontinued operations are excluded from adjusted financial results consequently throughout 2012 until its sale on November 30th. The results of the Nutrition business have been excluded from adjusted results.Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2012 revenues of approximately $15.1 billion decreased 7% year-over-year reflecting a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange an operational decline of approximately 5% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies notably Lipitor in all major markets.Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased 4% primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues, which was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 9% and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, and fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchases.Reported diluted EPS was $0.85 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter, in additional to the factors previously mentioned. Reported diluted EPS was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the Nutrition business to Nestl\u00e9 and lower overall cost, which were partially offset by the negative impact due to loss of exclusivity of certain products and several geographies and higher restructuring charges.Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter revenues by 2% or $271 million and unfavorably impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $161 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05.In the fourth quarter of 2012 Emerging Markets biopharmaceutical revenues were approximately $2.7 billion which reflects operational growth of 20% and the negative impact of foreign exchange of 3%. The revenue growth in Emerging Markets this quarter was driven primarily by strong volume growth in China, overall Emerging Market growth as well as the timing of government purchases of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar 13 in Turkey compared with the year-ago quarter.Volume growth of 22% in Emerging Markets was partially offset by price reductions of 2% resulting in the 20% operational growth. Of the fourth quarter Emerging Markets biopharmaceutical revenues approximately 42% which generated by Established Products, 34% by specialty and oncology products and 24% by primary care products.Fourth quarter biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets were approximately $1.2 billion which reflects operational growth of 26% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4%. Of the fourth quarter BRIC-MT biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 46% was generated by Established Products, 29% by specialty and oncology products and 25% by primary care products.During the fourth quarter, biopharmaceutical volume growth of 30% in the BRIC-MT markets was partially offset by price reductions of 4% resulting in operational revenue growth of 26%. Full-year operational growth in the BRIC-MT markets was 60% versus the year-ago period, reflecting volume growth of 20% partially offset by price reductions of 4%.As you can see in 2012 we met or exceeded most components of our financial guidance including achieving the top-end of our full-year 2012 revenue guidance and exceeding our just diluted EPS guidance. Our 2012 adjusted R&D expenses of $7.3 billion reflect opportunities to accelerate investments and promising late stage pipeline assets including palbociclib and advanced breast cancer.However, I want to point out that we expect full-year 2013 adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. And as I previously mentioned, reported diluted EPS was primarily favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the nutrition business.Now moving on to our 2013 financial guidance, which incorporates the full-year contribution from Zoetis, I'd like to comment specifically on a few elements of the guidance. First, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of 56.2 billion to 58.2 billion. I want to point out that this range includes the absorption of an anticipated $4 billion negative impact due to the loss of exclusivity of certain products in several geographies and to the near-term expiration of certain co-promotion agreements.In addition, it's important to note that approximately 200 million of 2012 revenues associated with products that Pfizer is contributing to the Pfizer-Hisun joint venture in China announced in 2012 will not be recorded as Pfizer revenues in 2013. The results of the joint venture will be recorded in other income.We expect 2013 SI&A to be in the range of 15.6 billion to 16.6 billion, the midpoint of which is less than the 2012 actual spending level. This range includes spending and support of key product launch opportunities such as Eliquis, Xeljanz and Prevnar 13 Adult.These are significant product opportunities and we intend to appropriately fund and support these launches to be competitive. In addition, we plan to essentially offset those incremental expenses through our cost reduction initiatives.We also expect our 2013 tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 28%, which among other items includes the federal R&D tax credit renewed by Congress under the American Taxpayer Relief Act for both 2012 and 2013.Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. This range includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact for certain ongoing costs associated with the potential separation of Zoetis, including the interest expense on Zoetis debt, certain duplicative costs for corporate support and manufacturing functions and other costs, as well as a $0.02 negative impact reflecting the difference in actual foreign exchange rates in 2012 compared with the mid-January 2013 exchange rates. As always, we will continue to monitor foreign exchange fluctuations and will update the potential impact if any on our 2013 expectations.I want to point out that with all other things being equal, the inclusion of the $0.02 of cost related to the separation in Zoetis and the $0.02 impact of recent foreign exchange movements has negatively impacted our 2013 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.04. Excluding these items, our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range would have been $2.24 to $2.34.Now moving on to key takeaways, we achieved the top end of our full year 2012 revenue guidance and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Our initial 2013 financial guidance includes the full-year contribution from Zoetis.We recently completed a 3.65 billion offering of Zoetis senior unsecured notes and remain on track to complete a potential initial public offering of up to a 19.8% ownership stake in Zoetis in the near future.In November, we completed the sale of our Nutrition business to Nestl\u00e9 for $11.85 billion. During the fourth quarter, we received U.S. regulatory approvals for Xeljanz and Eliquis. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.In 2012, we repurchased 8.2 billion or 349 million shares. As of December 31, 2012, we had 11.8 billion of authorization remaining under our current repurchase programs. Overall, we returned almost 15 billion to our shareholders in 2012 through dividends and share repurchases.Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thanks for the commentary, Frank, and operator at this point if we could please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.Tim Anderson - Sanford BernsteinThank you. On your tax rate guidance in 2013, can you say what it would be without (indiscernible) accounting and the R&D tax credit? And you had a one-time -- actually at the time of the Wyeth merger suggested a longer term rate of maybe 30%. Seeing what Bristol-Myers had done on lowering its tax rate remarkably, I'm wondering if you have any ability to restructure any of your legal entities as well. And then a second question, its obviously one that you get asked about a lot, but can you give us your latest thoughts on potentially carving up the drug side of business and the truly separate companies like you\u2019re doing with Zoetis. You\u2019ve been alluding this for -- for those possibility for quite sometime now, but I think investors don\u2019t really know it's sort of hard to assign to it, so when you say its higher probability, is it (indiscernible) size or is it lower probability?Ian ReadThank you, Tim. I will ask Frank to take care of the tax rate guidance and explain the 30% tax rate and any other comments you want to make on tax.Frank D\u2019AmelioSure. So, Tim on the 28%, which is down from 29.3% in 2012. That even if we didn\u2019t have this, I will call it the double benefit of the R&D tax credit in 2013, our tax rate would be closer to 28% and to 29%. So that\u2019s the way to think about it. What will happen in 2013 is we recorded the 2012 benefit in Q1 and then 2013 benefit we record throughout the year, just in terms of the accounting mechanics of the R&D tax credit. In terms of legal entity restructuring the way I think about that is our tax planning. We do tax planning all the time. If you look at our tax rate over the last couple of years, it\u2019s gone from 30% to last year\u2019s slightly higher than 29% and our guidance for this year is approximately 28%, we\u2019ll obviously continue to do tax planning. But the one thing I will say is, trying to project tax rates beyond 2013, given everything that\u2019s going on and with the uncertainty which is corporate tax reform I think is not approved in thing to do.So our current guidance is approximately 28% and obviously we\u2019ll do everything we can to meet or achieve \u2013 or exceed that guidance.Ian ReadTim on your additional question on the business models, I think I\u2019ve been talking some time now when discussing this with investors, that I see that we have two models or two businesses within Pfizer today, major segments. One being the innovative core and one being what we call value, which is basically post or pari \u2013 post-LOE products. And we have made that operational separation in the developed markets, in the U.S. and in Europe and Japan and Australia or in Korea and places like that. We haven\u2019t made that separation in Emerging Markets where we run it from a geographic basis. Although in the major markets we\u2019re moving towards creating units within those geographies that specialize in oncology or primary care or Established Products.I believe that at some point the markets will separate globally and there will be an innovative market distinct from an established market and I think Pfizer will continue to evolve into being managed that way. So, I hope that answers your question. Right now, as I think I said in my opening comments, Emerging Markets is working well, structure in the developed markets is working well, we\u2019re focused on the new launches, the pipeline, our capital allocation, expense discipline and we\u2019ll continue to evolve our model as we see value opportunities.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thank you, Ian. Our next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.Chris Schott - JP MorganGreat. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe one just kind of following upon on Tim\u2019s questions, and I think you\u2019ve talked about, as the Emerging Markets evolve that, we might see the business model evolve. Just following up on that, does it make sense for Pfizer to keep both a value and innovative core under the same umbrella if we get to a point with the Emerging Markets that structured us and that the current regional structure does not make sense? And the second question is, coming back to the bolt-on acquisitions, can you remind us how large a bolt-on acquisition you considered \u2013 you would be considering at this point? What are the priorities for you and when the Company, if a larger deal were to come along with the right fit, is that an opportunity for Pfizer or is that really not in the cards as we consider a capital deployment over the next couple of years? Thank you.Ian ReadThank you, Chris. Going back to the possibilities of [EM] and why would it make sense for Pfizer that to have those two businesses, I think it is not really a lot of point on speculating over this. Today we have both businesses certainly in an innovative side, need to be careful that you have \u2013 it tends to be more volatile and the Established Products allows you to take short-term movements in volatile in the business. But that being said, we will look at it, we will I believe move towards a separate management. And at that point, we'll be able to evaluate with the shareholders would prefer to have the option to invest in two distinct companies or not. I don't think that is a short-term priority right now for us. The priority is to evolve our internal model and measure how successful those businesses are and what management and leadership they require and are they distinct enough to go further.On the bolt-on acquisitions, we've said that we are focused on generating shareholder return and I'm going to make a few comments and ask Frank to add to it if he wants to. So, we look at bolt-on acquisitions as a way of adding high value businesses or intellectual property to Pfizer that can generate positive returns to shareholders above what we see as opportunity to share buybacks. Bolt-ons, I don't want to give you precise number, we did King that was 3.7, so what's a bolt-on? Middle multiples of that number, you pick it where our market cap's 180 billion what we do consider bolt-on for that size of company.Now as regards larger opportunities, we look at everything from a point of view of does it add value to Pfizer's shareholders? If it adds value, we never say never, we consider opportunities, but right now we continue to be focused on running our internal business and looking for bolt-on opportunities.Frank D\u2019AmelioI'll just add maybe three items to Ian's comments. I think first the way we think about this (indiscernible) in general is it's not a strategy in and of itself, it's an enabler of our strategy. So that would be point number one. I think the second thing in terms of bolt-ons, I think Ian sized it perfectly. King was several billion dollars. We viewed that as a bolt-on, the way we think about that. In terms of the priorities, which is something you asked, no changes. I think our priorities remain on focus therapeutic and disease areas, including the Emerging Markets. That's clearly where we've been biasing and I think that's where we'll continue to bias. Then in terms of the large deals, just to punctuate what Ian said, there's no new news here. We always say we never say never but our focus has been and continues to be on bolt-on acquisitions.Ian ReadWell, continues to be on bolt-on acquisitions and those acquisitions that add value to our shareholders.Chris Schott - JP MorganThank you.Chuck TrianoThank you. Our next question please operator.OperatorOur next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.Jay Olson - Goldman SachsHi. This is Jay Olson on behalf of Jami Rubin. A couple of questions. First off, with the focus on optimizing both your innovative and your value-based businesses, and we appreciate the significant progress being made in the innovative side with new product launches and pipeline progress. We wonder if you could elaborate a little on some of the initiatives you're taking to optimize the value-based business. And second of all, I understand your comments may be restricted, but could you help us understand what might be a fair timeline for your potential decision to monetize the remaining 80% of Zoetis and would a share exchange be something you would consider if Zoetis' shares traded a premium to Pfizer? Thank you.Ian ReadThank you, Jay. I'll ask Olivier who runs the Established Products business and Emerging Markets if he can comment on the work we're doing to grow what we call a value business. And then Frank will answer the question and I will help.Olivier BrandicourtSo thank you for your question. What we're trying to do in the Establish business division is to maximize the performance of those products in the LOE space and supporting their lifecycle, potentially with line extension and (indiscernible) product formulation. We also have recently built on the opportunity to quickly provide very reliable source of product in shortest situations. And we've been very active on the U.S. market in that space. We made also a move on sterile injectable. We think it's a high value space for the post LOE market. And in the space of differentiated formulation, I don't know if you've seen recently but we launched Quillivant XR in January. It was the first and only product which is in liquid formulation, an extended release for kids between 6 and 12 years old, with ADHT and we think we\u2019re going to be prove that, enhance and better formulation very competitive in that marketplace. So just providing few examples of what we\u2019re doing.Ian ReadThank you, Olivier. I will probably add to that we also have an active program in biosimilars, which would \u2013 I would consider probably in the post-LOE space.Olivier BrandicourtSure.Ian ReadFrank?Frank D'AmelioSo on Zoetis, I just want to reiterate what Chuck said at the beginning of the call, which is we\u2019re in a quiet period, so I\u2019m very limited in what I can say. So, what I can say is, we remain on track to complete a potential IPO for up to a 19.8% stake in Zoetis in the near future and the road show is taking place and relative to beyond the IPO, we\u2019re assuming one is completed, we will have a number of alternatives that are available to us for distributing and the remainder in to remaining shares and obviously we\u2019ll do what\u2019s best from an after tax return to our shareholders.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thank you, Frank. Next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum from ISI Group.Chuck TrianoHello, Mark.Mark Schoenbaum - ISI GroupSorry, can you hear me?Ian ReadYeah Mark, loud and clear.Mark Schoenbaum - ISI GroupApologies for that. Maybe I can ask couple of pipeline and product related questions. Number one on PD-991, I think this is the first earnings call since the fantastic data a month or two ago, just wondering if you can clarify your plans in terms of filing timelines and also if you can help us understand the market opportunity for that, that would be great. Then also, two major product launches this year, Pfizer arguably the highest profile launches in all biopharmas with Xeljanz and Eliquis. I would love it if you could give the investment community any advice or wisdom, when we think about those launches and maybe compare and contrast. Thank you.Ian ReadThank you. So on PD-991, palbociclib, I would ask Geno to comment on that and on that I can say outstanding data we got in the first of the Phase 2 trial. And then perhaps Geno would make some comments on how we see the evolving launch of Xeljanz and then John Young could make some comments on the launch of Eliquis. Thank you.Geno GermanoOkay. So for palbociclib, as you mentioned, we had some really terrific data that we were able to present in San Antonio last year that trial continues into this year. There are two patient cohorts. The one first patient cohort has completed, and the second patient cohort will complete later this year, and we\u2019re expecting to present data -- full-fledged data by the end of the year. And as the data emerges we will continue to discuss the data with the agencies around the world and determine the best pathway to bring this product to patients.Our current focus is on the ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patient population. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 trial in this population that confirms the results that we saw on Phase 2 in the very near term and we\u2019re anxious to proceed with that program. We also have plans to initiate additional Phase 3 programs in other breast cancer patient populations and then to explore the utility of the drug in tumors outside of breast cancer as we go through the rest of this year.With regard to the Xeljanz, we\u2019re off to a very good start. We\u2019re very pleased with the execution of the launch plans so far. It is early days, but the response\u2019s from physicians has been very favorable. They\u2019re particularly pleased with the second line indication and the ability to use Xeljanz without the need for Methotrexate. These are kind of recurring themes that we\u2019re hearing. We did expect that the majority of initial trial will be in the post-TNF patient population, and we think that, that\u2019s reasonable going forward although we are hearing physicians trying the drug in both the post-Methotrexate and the post-TNF patient population.Most physicians are putting a hand full of patients on the drug and want to see if the patients come back to evaluate them, and we\u2019re pretty optimistic that when they see those patients return that they will be pleased with the results given the outcome of our Phase 3 trials and in particular the feedback from patients on patient reported outcomes which were actually very favorable in our Phase 3 programs. So, we\u2019re on track, we feel good about Xeljanz \u2013 sorry, and I guess, with that I\u2019ll turn it over to John Young.John YoungThanks, Geno and thanks for your question, Mark. So obviously we are very excited about the opportunity that we have with Eliquis along with our partners BMS and I think clearly since the last call and a little more than six weeks, Eliquis received back-to-back approvals in the U.S., the 27 countries of the EU, Canada, Japan, South Korea for reducing the risk of stroke and some systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. So we've already launched in the UK, Germany, Denmark and the launches will progress in the EU over the coming months.In terms of the profile, which you know very well, clearly Eliquis is the only oral anticoagulant that's demonstrated superior risk reduction versus warfarin in the three critical outcomes of stroke prevention, major bleeding and all-cause mortality in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. So as a result, we certainly believe it offers a compelling profile for cardiologists and primary care physicians as reflected in our approved labels.We expect Eliquis to be widely available in most U.S. pharmacies by the end of January. Our U.S. sales teams from Pfizer and BMS are at the internal launch meeting as we speak. I will be on the road speaking to physicians on Monday next week. And overall, we really believe Eliquis differentiated profile combined with the extensive experience that Pfizer and BMS bring to the cardiovascular commercial markets certainly positions us well to succeed. Given the strength of the Eliquis data, the superior risk reduction versus warfarin and those three critical outcomes of stroke prevention, we believe that peers will certainly want to ensure that patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation have access to this clinically important medicine. And we expect steady progress as we penetrate this market over the course of 2013 and beyond.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thank you, John and Geno. Next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.Andrew Baum - CitigroupThanks. Three questions. First, Ian, do you see opportunities for the industry to remove excess capacity, the infrastructure from within EM and established market products through a reorganization consolidation of distribution channels? Second, for Mikael -- for Frank, I'm interested in how tax positioned you think your existing EM and Establish Products business is? And how much would alternative business structures potential enable you to optimize that? And then finally for Geno, apologies, could you just talk to where there's a preplanned interim analysis for your recently initiated first line PD-991 trial? Thank you.Ian ReadThank you, Andrew. Excess capacity in Emerging Markets, I think right now probably if you go back to the U.S. market in the '90s, most companies are focused on trying to get as large as a share as they can in these quickly growing economies. So, I don't think people are focused right now on taking out infrastructure. However, I do agree with you that just like we saw in the U.S. and Europe that clearly will be at some point opportunities to rationalize infrastructure in those geographies.As the second question, I didn't really understand, EP and Emerging -- I didn't really understand I'm afraid Andrew. Perhaps you can come back and reposition it. Geno, could you comment on palbociclib.Geno GermanoYeah. In the Phase 3 program, again, we're in ongoing discussion with the agency and our focus is really on finding the best way forward to reveal data that will enable the best decisions on making the drug available to patients. So, we will discuss interim analysis as part of that assessment.Frank D\u2019AmelioYeah, perhaps I could just say on Emerging Markets and EP, we have a clear vision of both businesses. We're getting what we believe are strong results. In EP, you could see the successful switch of Lipitor, you could see the [Coban] launch, focus on sterile injectables, focus on major markets. And in Emerging Markets, we have strong geographic based organizations that are driving value in both our innovative and our post LOE products. Olivier, do you want to add anything to that?Olivier BrandicourtI think there is a strong integration of EP products into EM and as we said very valuable. It represents basically about 45% of our revenue growing very strongly this quarter as you've seen that 21% and very often that is a result of combining innovative and EP products into the same sales force. For instance, cardiovascular sales force have this Lipitor and Norvasc, and in many geographies Lipitor is still (indiscernible) where Norvasc is not, but you do optimize the two brands that way. So, there are plenty of synergies to build on.Andrew Baum - CitigroupThank you.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thanks, Olivier. Next question please.OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Arphe from BMO Capital Markets.Ian ReadAlex?Chuck TrianoAlex?Ian ReadSeems to be an issue.Chuck TrianoWe\u2019ll move on to the next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America Merrill LynchIan ReadWe must be having a problem with the phones.Chuck TrianoGregg?Ian ReadWill give a second to see if it\u2019s a technical issue that people can\u2019t get through. Oh yeah, okay. Who is on?Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America Merrill LynchCan you hear me?Ian ReadYes.Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America Merrill LynchIt\u2019s Gregg Gilbert. Thanks. First question is on Emerging Markets growth in 4Q, I realize that could be a lumpy growth line. So, perhaps you could set the bar with a reasonable growth vehicle would be annually in \u201913 and possibly beyond? My second question, along the lines of maximizing value for the value business, the strategy so far for the developed market portion seems to be focused on Pfizer brands that lose exclusivity coupled with alliances with generic companies that do generic R&D. So going forward, could the strategy also include one internal development of small molecule generics and\/or to outright acquisitions of companies in that space? Again, I\u2019m thinking more about developed markets than the emerging piece. Thanks.Ian ReadOkay. Olivier, could you take the fourth quarter and also refocus the comments on the strategy in the developed markets with the [piece]?Olivier BrandicourtRight. Thank you, Gregg. So you\u2019ve seen \u2013 we posted 20% operational growth and that is a result actually of very good results across geographies. BRIC-MT have actually posted 26% operational growth, about 30% in volume and offset by pricing, but very strong across geographies and portfolio. Specialty is running at 45% growth this quarter, and as I mentioned before Emerging Market at 21%.Now having said that, you have a lot of one-time items this quarter, all right, especially Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar in Turkey and Mexico and if you exclude those one-time items you get to 16% growth for the quarter. And there are still volatility quarter-to-quarter in Emerging Markets and we remain committed to grow our Emerging Market division by high single-digit growth into coming years. So, that\u2019s the first question.Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America Merrill LynchYeah, and then on the Established Products to maintain the developed markets, what are the key strategies to grow the business such as sterile injectables and launches of Quillivant et cetera?Olivier BrandicourtRight. So, we remained focused on Established Products, to your point. We are not focusing in generic \u2013 and the generic portfolio outside the U.S. where we have a strong position with as you know with Greenstone. Outside the U.S. it's mainly emerging products \u2013 Established Products, and we\u2019re looking to bring sterile injectable and as I mentioned before new and differentiated formulation of Established Product.Ian ReadYes, so I suppose in the developed market, we would say that, business is a combination of Greenstone a quality supplier that closes market gaps with quality product. We\u2019ve done that also in the oncology space. We bring important and sterile injectable products. We\u2019re trying to launch innovative formulations and as distinct from Established Products in the Emerging Markets where it's still a primary care business, its field forces, its selling quality and it's selling the brand name of the products in Pfizer. Thank you.Chuck TrianoThank you. Next question, operator.OperatorYour next question is from Alex Arphe from BMO Capital Markets.Alex Arphe - BMO Capital MarketsGood morning. Can you hear me?Chuck TrianoYeah, we got your back Alex.Alex Arphe - BMO Capital MarketsOkay, great. Sorry about that. A question on Zoetis and its impact on Pfizer. We know from the information that's available that the Zoetis business is a lower margin business. If you were to proceed with full separation, how should we think about the margin expansion for Pfizer? And then on the CAPiTA trial, we know it's expected this year, I'm just wondering if you have a narrower timeline for it and if you could provide us any insights as to how we could quantify the adult opportunity? Thank you.Ian ReadFrank, if you could take the first part and Geno the second.Frank D\u2019AmelioYeah, so on the impact of Zoetis on our numbers and once again, I'm limited to what I can say. But the intent here is assuming we were to complete an IPO, we would issue \u2013 we would revise our guidance in early April after Zoetis has filed its 10-K which would be at the end of March. So at that time, we would revise our guidance byline item and then therefore you could see the impact that it would have on our numbers.Ian ReadGeno?Geno GermanoWith regard to CAPiTA, the program, the trial continues to accumulate patients. As you know, it's an event-driven trial so we really don't know what the date would be when the final event has been identified. Once we have all the events approved, we will complete the assessment, do the analysis and report the data. We expect that to happen later this year.With regard to the magnitude of the opportunity, assuming positive results, we think that having a vaccine with demonstrated ability to prevent non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia would be a valuable asset. There are over 300 million adults over 50 years of age in the developed markets and I think the number expands to over 700 million on the global marketplace. So we think that the opportunity is substantial.Alex Arphe - BMO Capital MarketsThank you, Geno.Chuck TrianoThanks, Geno and Frank. Next question, please.OperatorYour next question comes from Mark Goodman from UBS.Mark Goodman - UBSYes, good morning. Geno, maybe you can give us some color on some of the oncology launches, how they're going? Second of all, Olivier, I'm curious in the Emerging Markets, given all the cost cutting going on in the overall company, I was curious how much investments are occurring in the Emerging Markets where we invested significantly more for 2013 versus '12? And then maybe we could just get what the key Phase 2 readouts are for 2013 for data? Thanks.Ian ReadAll right, so Geno oncology; Olivier, if you could make some comments on the question there and Mikael, will you do the Phase 2.Geno GermanoSo for oncology, just a couple of comments about Xalkori. We got a full year now in the U.S. Xalkori achieved $100 million from sales in 2012 primarily in the U.S. It's now approved and launched in the U.S., Europe, Japan and several other smaller markets. Sales are continuing to grow as adoption and molecular testing continues to expand. We started out with about a 10% testing rate. Now the testing rate is over 60%.We think in the past year, we captured about a quarter of the potential patients in the U.S. We're also seeing an expansion in the duration of treatment as we're identifying patients earlier in their disease. So, we're happy with the progress of Xalkori and looking forward to expansion in new markets around the world.Inlyta has also gotten off to a very strong start in the U.S. where it's already established the leading share in second line. In Japan, it's the second most prescribed drug for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and with a 10% share and 40% in the second line setting. So, in general, we're seeing good growth of Inlyta, continued progress with Xalkori and now we're just getting started with Bosulif.Ian ReadThank you. Olivier?Olivier BrandicourtAll right. So for Emerging Markets definitely represent an important growth opportunity, so we have been investing quite significantly in this market in recent years. We continue to invest to remain competitive, however, we are putting transformation programs to ensure that we are optimizing our sales force and we have the best potential deployment, especially in support of new products which are going to be very important for Emerging Markets and the new launches, in addition to putting in place go-to-market models when it comes to brand marketing. So, while we\u2019re investing, we\u2019re also beginning to get positive leverage from those investments.Chuck TrianoThank you, Olivier.Mikael DolstenYeah, so we have a very exciting Phase 2 cohort reading out more than 10 studies over the next 12 months. I\u2019ll share a couple with you. Immunology, we have our best-in-class aisle 6 antibody with data coming in Lupus and also in Crohn\u2019s disease. We have a Med-Chem antibody for Chron\u2019s disease, a small molecule (indiscernible) oral inhibitor for COPD. In diabetes we have pancreatic glucokinase activator with a really unique profile, reading out in diabetes and glucose control. And we also have a Novel PDE5 inhibitor for diabetic nephropathy. In vaccines, we\u2019re expecting data from Staph aureus. Our F-14 biosimilar are starting to move very nicely. We recently had positive data on Trastuzumab, which is exploring plans to go into Phase 3 while this year we expect data from our second biosimilar rituximab after [finalization] of Phase 2.In some small areas we\u2019re strengthening our portfolio in rare diseases and have a readout on a GMI-1070 in sickle cell crisis. Also pieces Canine had a positive readout that we\u2019ve reported last year and we have a Phase 2b data coming, which underpins then our path forward to Phase 3.Chuck TrianoThank you, Mikael. Next question please.OperatorYour next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays.Tony Butler - Barclays CapitalThanks very much. Just sticking with the pipeline, (indiscernible) if possible, you actually get the read out of the Phase 3 study ARCHER with dacomitinib this year. And then second, I guess, for Geno going back to Xeljanz, some doc feedback to us, and again its limited, has suggested that patients do not actually know about the drug. Is patient awareness important at this early in the launch? And as a DTC campaign actually in the carts? Thanks very much.Ian ReadThank you. Mikael, are you going to talk to the \u2026Mikael DolstenYeah, so I can mention, we're very excited about dacomitinib. As you know it's a pan-HER inhibitor irreversible binding and it did very well in our Phase 2 data against Tarceva. The ARCHER trial that you referred to is event driven and we expect to date probably more during the first half of 2014 to have accrued the number of ends required to close the trial. In addition to that trial where we go against Tarceva as we did in our Phase 2, we also have another partner trial against refractory non-small cell lung cancer. So, its run by the National Cancer Institute of Canada, so it's a nice study set behind dacomitinib and we look very much forward to see that data come for possibly a new generation of EGFR inhibitors.Chuck TrianoThank you. Geno.Geno GermanoSo with regard to awareness on Xeljanz, fortunately within the first few weeks of launch we are near 100% awareness among the prescribing community which is terrific. And as I mentioned before a lot of enthusiasm for the drug. Patient awareness is much lower, and we haven\u2019t done a lot of work with consumers, but we expect to roll out a consumer program around the middle of this year in keeping with the pharmaceutical guidelines to hold off on direct-to-consumer advertising for the first six months of launch. But we do think that consumer communication will be an important driver. We know that consumers are excited about the idea of having an oral option and also excited about the potential to have an effective therapy without the need for Methotrexate.Tony Butler - Barclays CapitalThank you.Chuck TrianoThanks, Geno. Moving on to next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann & CompanyThanks for the question. So, first for Ian. Ian, can you just maybe clarify your comments in terms of the separation of the management. Are you planning to actually tighten down the management from the multi-tiered organizations to now officially providing reporting at some point around the structure of the two businesses as you described them, the innovative core and the value business? And then separately, Geno, can you just help us understand back when Prevnar 7, there was a decision at Wyeth way back when to not continue forward with Prevnar 7 in the adult setting in large part because of herd immunity that is created by dosing infants. How do you see herd immunity influencing the adult indication for Prevnar 13 and is it just really more a timing related issue as we think about the impact of herd immunity with Prevnar 13? Thanks a lot.Ian ReadThank you, Seamus. What you were really talking about was segment reporting. Right now we have the management split and the responsibility split in the developed markets. We don't have that split in the Emerging Markets, so it's really I think premature at this stage to look at segment reporting. But we'll continue to review that so as to give shareholders the transparency they need with that.Geno GermanoSeamus, just regarding Prevnar, my recollection is that we choose not to go forward with the adult indication on 7 because we were so focused on advancing and broadening the serotype coverage and getting to 13 ahead of our competition. Once we achieve the formulation for 13, we were anxious to proceed to the adult vaccine.With regard to herd immunity, we know there is some herd immunity with the vaccination of children. There are a variety of epidemiologic studies that show different rates of herd effect. There are surveillance programs as well underway to identify the herd effect. And what we see is that there is a residual disease burden that we think that the adult vaccine will help prevent in the adult patient population and the opportunity remains significant.Chuck TrianoThank you, Geno. Next question, please.OperatorYour next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.David Risinger \u2013 Morgan StanleyThanks very much. I have some questions on Xeljanz and then on Emerging Markets future growth prospects. So with respect to Xeljanz, we're going to try to benchmark the prescription trend ramp and I just wanted to understand your sampling program because on the one hand I understand that you are giving 30-day samples, but on the other hand for virtually all drug launches, drug companies give samples, so I don't know if your sampling program is unusually strong relative to other product launches such that we should expect unusually low reported prescriptions?And then with respect to the once daily Xeljanz which is entering Phase 2 in 2013, could you help us understand whether Pfizer plans to run bridging studies to shorten the timeline to filing and when do you plan to file that once daily for approval?And then changing gears to Emerging Markets, the operating performance growth was 12% in 2012 including a huge fourth quarter which seems to be driven by some anomalies and I know that you're sticking to your high single digit growth target operationally for Emerging Markets. But is that too conservative because you reported 12% in 2012 and it looks like high-single digits growth going forward would be below market growth or should we think about potential upside to that target for high single digit Emerging Market growth going forward? Thank you.Ian ReadThank you. Geno, could you answer the Xeljanz issues..Geno GermanoWith regard to the sampling program on Xeljanz, there's really two components and one is we have a patient support program to help patients access the reimbursement and to go through that process, which is very similar to any of the other drugs that they would be using in rheumatology. So there's a 14-day supply that we make available to patients to ensure that they can start therapy as soon as possible while they're going through that reimbursement process.In addition to that, we identified a group of rheumatologists who we wanted to have access to drug right away so that they gain experience immediately and we gave 30-day supply bottles to that identified population of rheumatologist to use, to gain that early experience. Now whether we\u2019ll continue to add program into the future or not is unknown at this point, but the very initial impact of these two sampling programs will range from fairly short period of time. And with regards to the once a day program, we\u2019re going to want to have the once a day have adequate labeling to enable use across all of the indications that we\u2019re pursuing. So the program is a robust program and we\u2019re still in discussion actually with the agency on the exact protocol.Ian ReadThank you. David, on the Emerging Markets, I would agree with you that most multinationals are growing at slower than the overall market rate as these markets are very local in their healthcare delivery and there are strong local competitors who given the lack of intellectual property in the last 25 years have brought portfolios and add to those portfolios very fast. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect the multinational will grow the marketplace. That being said, we have had accelerating growth, I was very pleased with the growth in the fourth quarter. However, I still believe that it\u2019s appropriate and aggressive to maintain a high single-digit growth rate in the Emerging Markets.Chuck TrianoThank you. Next question please, operator.OperatorYour next question comes from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.Catherine Arnold - Credit SuisseThanks very much. I wanted to ask you a few things. First of all, could you comment on your strategic interest in the eye business for the right price and also tell us when we\u2019re going to hear about your dry AMD program? And then just a nuance on the CDK, I don\u2019t think we got you is the part two study comes out as positive or directionally in the same as you\u2019re seeing for part one with your \u2013 of your ER negative, ER positive HR negative study which you presumably go to FDA for an accelerated approval path? Thanks.Ian ReadEye interest \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that the eye is a stated strategic disease area for us, so that would probably answer that one. On macular degeneration, could you comment on that?Geno GermanoYeah. So, you know we have more opportunities efforts in ophthalmology based on scientific spin of opportunity. The particular program we have RN6G is an antibody against amyloid that we made some findings seem to in a models play role in dry AMD. The study is up and running, but we\u2019ll not have any data coming this year.Ian ReadAnd on palbociclib which is the CDK 4\/6, I think Geno, has commented on this, I\u2019ll just reinforce it. We have great data in the first trial. We have a second trial running which is a different cohort of patients. We expect to be able to give you the results of that trial in the second half of this year. And as the data revolves we will continue to work with the FDA in our agencies, and we will clearly try and work with the regulators to bring this product to patients as fastest as it\u2019s appropriate given the data we have.Chuck TrianoAll right. Thanks for the context, Ian. Next question please.OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.Stephen Scala - Cowen & CompanyThanks. A couple of follow-ups. First, has the strong flu season increased the event rate in capita and has it changed the timing from the Q3 conclusion which I think is what the Company has said previously. And secondly, has the decision by many payers to pay for Xeljanz post-TNF failures been mostly dictated by price, by lack of real world experience or by some other factor? Thank you.Chuck TrianoThank you, Steve. Geno.Geno GermanoSo, I mean it has been a robust flu season this year, and generally that is associated with a higher number of events. I can\u2019t confirm or deny whether or not there has been an acceleration of events in the trial. Clearly the sooner the events accumulate to the target the sooner we\u2019ll have results. So, we\u2019ll let you know as soon as we know something there. And with regard to reimbursement for Xeljanz, actually the reimbursement rates -- reimbursement coverage has been very favorable. Most of the plans are reimbursing out of the gate and we\u2019ll conduct category reviews over time.Chuck TrianoGreat. Thank you, Geno. Next question, please.OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Tong from Wells Fargo Securities.Michael Tong - Wells Fargo SecuritiesHi. Just a quick question with regard to your biosimilar strategy, when do you expect a first biosimilar product to get onto the market? And within 18 months of that, how many more would you think you'd be able to get through?Ian ReadMichael, we have \u2013 I think we're focusing on five molecules initially. We have two in sort of active development and three that were \u2013 are further back. I really can't give you the \u2013 we don't give timings, but the lead candidate in biosimilar is in phase \u2013 Mikael, you indicated phase\u2026?Mikael DolstenYeah. We just completed successfully with our first biosimilar. I briefly mentioned earlier trastuzumab which is the name for Herceptin, completed Phase 2 and\/or exploring plans for a Phase 3 opportunity this year. The second that Ian alluded to rituximab is going to complete in this year a Phase 2 study. So you can see its good momentum. We're using the deep skills in biopharmaceuticals and manufacturing in Pfizer to provide quality data.Ian ReadAnd so far we're very encouraged by the Phase 2 data and our ability in this area.Chuck TrianoThank you, Ian and Mikael. We have time for one last question please, operator.OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Kim Vukhac from CLSA.Kim Vukhac - CLSAThank you. Just a quick question. With regard to the guidance, can you talk about what your share repurchase assumptions are for the year? In addition, speak to the, maybe the timing of the buyback, has it weighted more the first half versus second or more? Should we assume evenly spread out throughout the year?Ian ReadThank you. I think Frank can give you the numbers on that.Frank D\u2019AmelioYeah. So Kim, the assumption is mid-teen billions relative to buybacks. And in terms of the rhythm, I think the way to think about that is throughout the year. So no heavy weighting one area or the other just kind of throughout the year and mid-teen billions.Chuck TrianoThank you, Frank. Thank you everybody for your attention this morning.Ian ReadThank you. Have a good day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Pfizer's fourth quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16790":["Pfizer Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles Triano","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter 2017 performance and 2018 financial guidance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development, John Young, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com\/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, including in part one, item 1A, that is filed with the SEC and available at their website sec.gov and on our website at pfizer.com","Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of those statements.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K, dated today, January 30, 2018. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our website at pfizer.com\/investors.","Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will speak about our performance for the year; the continued advancement of our pipeline which we believe is more robust and productive than it has been in more than a decade and the expected impact of U.S. tax reform on Pfizer. Frank will provide details regarding the quarter and our 2018 financial guidance.","Pfizer had another solid year in 2017, despite having just over a $3 billion negative revenue impact due to LOEs and the divestment of Hospira Infusion Systems, we were able to offset this impact and report flat operational revenue as we saw growth in many of our anchor brands.","We also saw continued growth in emerging markets, which was up 11% operationally compared with the previous year. I\u2019ll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our business starting with Pfizer Innovative Health.","This business had another strong year, growing its topline 8% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our best-selling medicines. Ibrance revenues grew 47% operationally to $3.1 billion for the year.","To date, Ibrance has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients around the world and received regulatory approval in more than 80 countries; however, revenues in certain developed European markets were negatively impacted by a onetime price adjustment to full year 2017 revenues.","This adjustment was the result of agreements to establish pricing levels comparable to historical European pricing analogs for oncology products ensure patient access and drive expected future growth in these markets. We see this as a positive for the future of the brand.","We remain confident in the profile of Ibrance based on a number of factors including safety and efficacy. We are working to build on Ibrance\u2019s initial success with trials in the early breast cancer setting and the HER2 positive metastatic setting and move our novel next-generation investigational CDK inhibitor, which may be effective for patients as they become resistant to Ibrance. We expect to have this asset in the clinic this year.","Eliquis alliance and direct sales revenue grew 47% operationally to $2.5 billion, and is the number one new two brand oral anticoagulant prescribed by cardiologists in 21 markets. Xeljanz experienced 45% year-over-year operational growth and achieved its first year of blockbuster status.","We expect our information immunology franchises to continue to strengthen over the recent U.S. approval of Xeljanz\u2019 s for psoriatic arthritis, and we are hopeful that we will receive U.S. approval for a further indication ulcerative colitis this year.","Chantix revenue grew 18% operationally to nearly $1 billion for the year. Lyrica revenues within [ph] Pfizer\u2019s Innovative Health grew 9% operationally the $4.5 billion for the year. Lyrica continued to be a strong contributor to the Innovative Health and we anticipate that Lyrica will maintain its market exclusivity in the United States until the end of 2018 or through June 2019 if the FDA grants approval for the paediatric extension exclusivity.","Pfizer\u2019s share of Xtandi\u2019s U.S. net sales was $590 million for the year. In the fourth quarter 2017, Pfizer\u2019s share of net sales was $168 million up 12% from the third quarter 2017 and 22% from the fourth quarter of 2016.","A number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi continues to grow and reach an all-time high of more than 1,700 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with approximately 500 for ZYTIGA.","In terms of potentially expanding Xtandi\u2019s benefit to men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, in September we announced that the Phase 3 PROSPER trial in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint. And we look forward to presenting detailed results at the ASCO GU Congress on February 8.","We also pleased that in partnership with Astellas we have submitted the PROSPER data to the FDA seeking to expand the label to the non-metastatic CRPC setting. We are awaiting the FDA\u2019s acceptance of the application for review.","Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our consumer healthcare business. This could include anything from a full or partial separation business to ultimately deciding to retain the business and we continue and expect to make decisions during 2018.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the year declined, due in large part to expected products LOEs, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets in our biosimilars portfolio.","Emerging markets revenue grew 7% operationally for the year to 7 billion. China led the way growing 16% operationally. Our biosimilars business grew 66% operationally in 2017 to 531 million, and we remain the number one biosimilars company globally. We also advanced six biosimilars pipeline products during the year through various regulatory and data milestones.","EH\u2019s growth in emerging markets and biosimilars were offset by product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business. Our sterile injectable shortages are primary for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio, and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues.","As we stated previously, we have a robust action plan in place and we believe we will make substantial progress in 2019 towards reducing these shortages.","Turning to Inflectra. At the end of December each share increased to 5.6% of overall U.S. infliximab volume, up from 4.9% at the end of September. This increase was primarily due to the products continued strong performance in closed systems, such as the VA where the insurer and provider are the same entity. Despite J&J\u2019s exclusionary contracting with regard to Remicade, we continue to see increased coverage for Inflectra amongst commercial payors.","And just last week, the appellate court ruled that a key patent that J&J is asserted to block access to Inflectra is invalid.","Last quarter, I talked about the expected decline in the number and revenue impact of LOEs facing our business. And the further strengthening of R&D pipeline, we expect these trends to continue.","In terms of LOEs, we expect the full year year-over-year impact to be about $2 billion in 2018, which remain significantly lower than our recent past. We expect the impact of LOEs will remain in the $2 billion range through 2020 before improving to $1 billion in 2021 and then $500 million or less from 2022 through 2025.","At the same time, our pipeline continues to generate exciting new opportunities for our company and for the patients who benefit from our innovative therapies. In 2017, we received 10 approvals from the FDA. This is significantly more than we achieved in any year in the past decade.","Let me touch on some of our most recent advances. In oncology, we recently presented positive results from the Phase 3 EMBRACA trial, which showed that our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib significantly extended progression free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer.","In partnership with Merck KGaA, we look forward to continued progress with Bavencio, our PD-L1 inhibitor. We have upcoming data readouts in second line non small cell lung cancer and first line renal cell carcinoma in combination with INLYTA.","In addition, the triplet study exploring the combination Bavencio, our 4-1BB agent, and our OX40 monoclonal antibody in solid tumors ended the clinic in the first half of 2017. We will continue to evaluate this combination throughout 2018.","In 2018, we expect to advance multiple oncology filings in the registration process including talazoparib in EMBRACA positive metastatic breast cancer, Xtandi for non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, for which we have submitted an sNDA based on the Phase 3 PROSPER data.","Lorlatinib which has shown activity in almost all known clinically acquired ALK mutations and health positive non-small cell lung cancer. Dacomitinib in EGFR mutated non small cell lung cancer based on the positive ARCHER 1050 findings published in September and our SMO inhibitor, glasdegib, for acute myeloid leukemia based on Phase 2 results.","In Inflammation & Immunology, we have seven ongoing JAK clinical programs providing us with the strongest immuno kinase franchise in the industry. The Phase 2 data for our oral once daily JAK1 in atopic dermatitis was presented in September and this asset is the first and only JAK1 to enter Phase 3 in 2017.","In Vaccines we began Phase 3 trials with our C. difficile vaccine. The studies have been enrolling well and our recent competitive decision has positioned us as a potential first-in-vaccine.","Leveraging the success of Prevnar, we also moved into Phase 2 of our next-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes. In addition, we are advancing a Phase 2 tetravalent Staphylococcus aureus vaccine with fast-track designation.","In 2017 we also continue to take important steps towards becoming an industry leader in gene therapy. We see gene therapies as a field that holds tremendous promise for patients in areas of devastating need, particularly in rare, monogenic diseases with loss of function.","We finished the year with two assets in the clinic that are potential therapies for Hemophilia B and Hemophilia A.","In 2018, we expect readouts from multiple pivotal studies in rare diseases, including Rivipansel for Sickle cell disease and Vyndaqe in Cardiomyopathy. We also have begun screening patients for our potential gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.","We also broke ground on $100 million commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina and when complete we\u2019ll have end-to-end capabilities from manufacturing to commercialization.","Before closing my remarks today, I\u2019d like to spend a few moments discussing the new U.S. tax code, and its expected impact on our business. As you know, Pfizer has been advocating for many years for comprehensive tax reform.","That\u2019s because the system that had been in place for U.S. based multinational companies that are competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors with regard to the tax rate and international access to capital. The new tax code addresses these issues and helps level the playing field to make U.S. companies more competitive.","After evaluating the expected positive net impact, the new tax code will have on Pfizer; we have decided to take several actions. Over the next five years, we plan to invest approximately 5 billion in capital projects in the U.S. including the strengthening of our manufacturing presence in the U.S.","We also expect these reforms to favourably influence future investments. We plan to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we made a $200 million charitable contribution to the Pfizer foundation. This organization provides grants and investment funding to support organizations and social entrepreneurs in an effort to improve healthcare delivery.","We have also earmarked approximately 100 million for a special one-time bonus to be paid to all non-executive Pfizer colleagues. Given the more favorable repatriation provision, we are continuing reviewing our capital allocation opportunities under the new tax code. We will remain disciplined in our approach with value creation for shareholders remaining our compass.","In summary, we continue to deliver our strategy in 2017. As a result, we saw continued growth of new brands, achieved a record number of product approvals, further advanced our pipeline, which we believe will be a significant competitive advantage and growth driver going forward. And we entered 2018 even better positioned to deliver new medicines for patients and increase value for our investors going forward.","All of these achievements have been made possible by the strength of our leadership team, which we further strengthened recently with Albert Bourla taking on the role of Chief Operating officer, John Young, leading Pfizer Innovative Health and Angela Wong becoming the head of Pfizer Essential Health. These appointments are testament to the depth and breadth of our leadership talent, which has positioned us very well for continued success.","Now we\u2019ll turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2018.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks Ian, good day everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast.","Now moving onto the financials, fourth quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $13.7 billion, which include the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $114 million, partially offset by slight operational decline of $39 million.","If you exclude both the prior year quarter revenues for Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, and the positive impact of foreign exchange, fourth quarter 2017 revenues increased $240 million or 2%.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by Eliquis globally, Xeljanz in the U.S., Prevenar 13 in emerging markets, and Lyrica, Ibrance and Chantix in the U.S. all of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Viagra in the U.S. because of generic competition beginning in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition.","Revenues for our Essential Health business in the fourth quarter decreased 8% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of 2017. The remainder of the decrease was due to an 18% operational decrease from Peri-LOE Products, including the expected declines in Pristiq in the U.S. and Lyrica in developed Europe markets, as well as a 10% operational decline in the Sterile Injectable portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. all of which were partially offset by operational growth 72% from biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in the U.S. and developed Europe.","In Emerging Markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 10% operationally, in the fourth quarter primarily due to 10% growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 23% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio.","Fourth quarter reported diluted EPS was $2.02 compared with $0.13 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts over the TCJA in late 2017.","As a result, Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter full year 2017 provision for taxes on reported income was favourably impacted by approximately $10.7 billion, primarily reflecting the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities which includes the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.","Our fourth quarter reported diluted EPS was also favourably impacted by lower restructuring and implementation cost and unfavourably impacted by higher losses on debt retirement.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.62 versus $0.47 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, lower adjusted total cost and expenses and fewer shares outstanding.","I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 80 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2017 and completed in May of 2017.","In addition, the full year 2017 weighted average shares used to calculate EPS was 6,058 million shares, a reduction of 100 million shares compared versus full year 2016.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $114 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $127million.","As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter","As you can see on the chart, we have met or exceeded all components of our 2017 financial guidance. Moving onto full year 2018 financial guidance, it\u2019s important to note that this guidance includes a full year contribution from consumer healthcare and assumes no generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. during 2018.","We currently expect generic competition in June of 2019 contingent upon a six month term extension for paediatric exclusivity, which we are currently pursuing. We expect 2018 revenues to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.","This range incorporates an anticipated 900 million favorable impact of foreign-exchange. I want to point out that beginning in the first quarter of 2018 forward, total Viagra worldwide revenue will be reported in essential health, due to generic competition that began in the U.S. in December of 2017.","Previously revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada have been recorded in our innovative health business through December of 2017.","We expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 17% in 2018 and sustainable for the foreseeable future, which is significantly lower than the approximately 23% that we previously anticipated for full year 2017 and reflects the enactment of the TCJA.","Because of the significant changes in complexities to the tax law, this financial impact on 2018 guidance is provisional only and therefore subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the tax reform legislation.","I want to point out for modeling purposes that based on 2017 results a 1% reduction in the effective tax rate on adjusted income results in an approximate $0.03 increase to adjusted diluted EPS.","Finally, as a result of the enactment of the recent legislation, we expect to repatriate the majority of our cash held internationally in 2018. As a reminder, as of the third quarter 2017 Pfizer had approximately $24.2 billion of cash and investments.","Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.90 to $3, which incorporates $0.06 favorable impact from foreign exchange and $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2018, the impact of which we expect to be offset by about half from dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","Moving on to key takeaways; we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding HIS revenues for the prior quarter and the impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased 2% operational year-over-year driven by the strong growth from Eliquis and Xeljanz.","We issue 2018 financial guidance ranges reflecting 4% revenue growth and 11% adjusted diluted EPS growth at their respective midpoints compared with 2017 actual results. We accomplish several key product and pipeline milestones and we returned $12.7 billion to shareholders in 2017 through dividends and share purchases including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles Triano","And again, for the prepared remarks, operator, can we please poll for Q&A now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Great. Thank you. Good morning and thanks for talking the questions. I guess the first one for Ian, how should we think about the European pricing adjustment longer-term. Are these established contracts or should we expect more step downs, and could it have implications for U.S. pricing and pricing in general?","And then follow-up for Frank, I appreciate that you\u2019re still reviewing your capital allocation opportunities, but your 5 billion share buyback seem conservative given all the options available to you if we think about the potential divestiture of the consumer business more efficient access to ex U.S. cash, how should we think about potential upside there?","And finally Mikael, the tanezumab Phase 3 pivotal trials are coming up, how should we think about some of the previous safety issues that have delayed the seemingly promising asset? Thank you very much.","Ian Read","Thank you, Alex. So, I\u2019m going to let Albert answer European price question, but I would like to point out ahead on that these negotiations were not related to competitive pressure. And I see the establishment of pricing for Ibrance in Europe as a major positive for the business going forward at prices that are consistent with the European oncology analogs. Albert, do you want to add any more context?","Albert Bourla","Yes. First of all, as you said, the MBC something most of you said now, and you said it your remarks. And let\u2019s clarify the demand in Europe, continuous to throw [ph] very strong growth. We had 20% this quarter compared to previous quarter. And we had 29,000 Ibrance patients in Europe this year. To point that in context in the first year of the U.S. launch we had 20,000.","Now the negative on this quarter as Ian said, it is due to one-time price adjustment with the full-year revenues, and these were part of finalizing broader reinvestment negotiations that will establish pricing levels to the historical, very comparable to historical European pricing analogs. And at the same time ensure broad patient access to drive potential future volume and more importantly revenue growth in these places.","I'm very satisfied with these agreements. Overall we recognize the value that Ibrance brings to patients, and at the same time they offer an attractive cost-benefit to the payers. So in conclusion, in 2018 we expect to see strong volume and revenues growth in Europe and other international markets as a result of these deals.","Ian Read","Thank you. Frank, do you want to talk about the capital allocation?","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So, Alex, you mentioned the 5 billion in buyback. Let me just run the numbers and then I'm going bump this up to a capital allocation conversation. So we\u2019ve announced 5 billion in buybacks. We also announced we\u2019re increasing our dividend to $0.34 a quarter, the combination of dividends and buybacks to 2018 we\u2019ll return more than 13 billion directly to shareholders.","Now let me pump it up to more of a capital allocation conversation. The four priority areas that we've had in the past continue to be our four priority areas; those are obviously investing in our business, dividends, buybacks and M&A. So those were the areas, they remain the areas. And the nice thing about Pfizer is we have the ability to play in all four areas as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past.","Now, given tax reform and given, we\u2019re exploring strategic options for a consumer business, we will continue to review what our value \u2013 what our options our. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options in all these areas on a going forward basis.","Ian Read","The answer to tanezumab please, Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you. You know, Alex, thank you for shading attention on tanezumab. We are very excited about the trial of six different studies, 7000 patients that are starting to read out early fall this year and then each of the trials further on into 2019. We have a unique position in the space as we gathered tremendous experience and insight in how to manage our NGF antibody and deal with rare events recorded as rapidly progressing away. We have been able to design the trial to minimize the risk for such to cure [ph] that includes reducing concomitant chronic use of insights. It includes lowering the dose of tanezumab in OA where some of these rare cases were seen in our trials while keeping higher doses in chronic low back pain where this is for worst not really reported.","We've introduced risk management program and stopping criteria for individual patients. So overall we think we have really learned uniquely and been able to design a study that should minimize the risk of such events. I also want to take a step back and say that macro environment for the need of new pain medications have really changed. Perspective a number of years ago was that unmet medical need was rather satisfied. Unfortunate we have learned that the current pain medications particularly opioids have severe issues no just when it comes to the impact on G.I. respiratory but also the great addiction crisis that we\u2019re battling with.","In contrast of course, monoclonal antibody like this that can be given conveniently sub-cute every eight weeks. We believe have a very attractive profile and we look forward very much to the readouts of the trials and report those. Thank you.","Charles Triano","Thanks Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Hi, great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just one that there\u2019s been lot of discussion around the potential new entrants entering direct distribution; we had a news today around Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. The quote and the commentary around -- they\u2019re obviously talking lot about healthcare costs and the impact it\u2019s having on the economy. You guys generated 26 million of sales in the U.S. last year. Just if you can kind of comment on how you see these impacting things maybe near-term and also longer-term? And how is it not ultimately a bad thing for larger companies such as Pfizer and that have generate so much of their sales from the U.S.","And then my second question just quickly around guidance, totally different topic, with Xtandi you mentioned sort of positive news you have there, but just if you can talk about how you\u2019re thinking about that product. We obviously make ZYTIGA generics in the market later this year. And I\u2019m wondering how you think might impact ZYTIGA business? Thanks so much.","Ian Read","Vamil, thank you for the question. You know, vis-a-vis Amazon I think we\u2019ve discuss this before. We welcome any entrance to the distribution system like an improve efficiencies and ensure that patient state their medication at the appropriate cost and in the appropriate time. So all in all I would say that, the distribution system not necessarily the way that the rebates and price that handle, but the distributed system is already highly efficient.","Now with regard to the announcement today, I really surprise with your comments, don\u2019t really know how to react to it. There\u2019s very little detail in the announcement. Nevertheless, I would see it as totally positive for our industry. Any attempt to lower healthcare costs, I going to have to involve -- my belief using medicines to ensure adherence, make sure the management, that the appropriate management of diseases. We represent two points or we represent 10% to 14% healthcare costs.","So I would hope that private actors have come into this space with low cap. We\u2019ve initially seen more opportunity through a whole distribution chain of cost. And so \u2013 and we look at that as a positive way in controlling costs. So I think it\u2019s encouraging that private actors enter in this and it\u2019s encouraging for the use of modern pharmaceuticals. And Xtandi, would you deal with please, Albert.","Albert Bourla","Of course, and first let me start by saying how please we are to see total demand outstanding, growing 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, particularly the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi continues to grow and reached an all time higher 1700 in this quarter, which is more than three times the number of urologists that are prescribing ZYTIGA for example.","Urologists, right now, represent 41% growth in 2017 compared to 2016. And of course not to mention what we had \u2013 not to miss mentioning that we had another quarter with sequential sales growth. The sales of this quarter were 12% higher than the sales of the previous quarter. As regards to patient assistance program, as a person of total demand, it was generally stable compared to the third quarter of this year, which is what we were expecting, knowing that the people out there are enrolling ourselves in this program. They are enrolled for the full calendar year.","We believe that the demand for patient assistant programs as a percentage of total demand will decrease in 2018 as compared what we saw in 2017. As regards ZYTIGA generics, they are difference between Xtandi and ZYTIGA safety, they are differences in terms of closing frequency, they are differences in terms of requirements for steroid core administration, and they are also very different monitoring acquirements. And as you know in the future we hope to have different indications also based on potential approval of the PROSPER study in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and more studies that are coming in the earlier setting. So, of course, we will continue monitoring the market but we are not right now concern about ZYTIGA generics.","Charles Triano","Thanks, Albert, can we move to our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Thanks very much and congrats Ian and Frank on all of your efforts to educate Washington having finally paid off. With respect to my questions I wanted to ask for a little bit more color and perspective on Ibrance in Europe. I think it would just be helpful if you explain which countries agreed. How it all came together, so quickly to result in a price reset in a given quarter since obviously many countries negotiate pricing independently. So that\u2019s my first question.","Second, with respect to Inflectra has J&J's contract language changed such that Inflectra will have greater commercial access and commercial uptake in 2018? And then my third question is for Frank. How should we think about the tax rate beyond 2018? Should we expect it to a decline below 17%? Thanks very much.","Ian Read","So David, thank you for the congratulations. I do believe that Pfizer was to play a major role in putting a spotlight on the disadvantageous corporate tax situation for U.S. multinationals, so appreciate the comments.","Now on an Ibrance, I would like to number one, we\u2019re not getting into discussion of which countries. This is all proprietary information that\u2019s important for us that we don't discuss in the public. Two, it was not quick. It was a result of ongoing negotiations over substantial part of 2017. And I think this is what you need to be focused on, if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019re saying so is, what is this set up for the future Ibrance. And we have managed to establish wide reimbursement and pricing.","What we believe the European market is comparable analogs. We don't see there\u2019s any spill over to other markets in Asheville or in the European context. So we see this agreement as setting a strong baseline for patient access in Europe and continued growth of the franchise. So I think this is extremely positive for Ibrance. It comes in an unusual way as the negotiations reflected the full impact in one quarter rather than spread over the whole year or spread over a period of years. So, to my point of view it's very, very positive going forward for Ibrance and for patients in Europe. Would like to do with Inflectra, please John.","John Young","So thanks for the question, David. So I\u2019m obviously not aware of any changes that J&J have made to their contracting status. And I think we\u2019ve commented on that previously and Ian mentioned this in his call. And let me just say that we obviously continue to work towards minimizing the impact in 2018 of their exclusionary contracting practices by growing include systems and continue to seek increased coverage amongst commercial players.","As Ian mentioned in his prepared remarks in quarter four approximately half of Inflectra\u2019s volume comes from closed system such as the VA where the insurer and provider are the same entity. And in those close systems where which prioritize healthcare savings over short-term rebating. As of quarter four we\u2019ve now reached to 50% share of infliximab. But we\u2019re obviously very conscious that those closed systems represents only a small proportion of the market round about 5%, but we really believe that our performance in those closed systems demonstrates that where payers, providers and patients have access to Inflectra that it can offer significant value to the healthcare system. And we\u2019ll continue progressing that aggressively.","Ian Read","And then on the tax rate question, Dave, we set for this year approximately 17% and then in terms of going forward I would continue to use approximately 17%. We believe that rate is sustainable. If anything were to change obviously I will let you and everyone else know. ","Charles Triano","Thank you. Next question please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham ","Good morning guys, and thanks for the question. Ian or Frank, just on the topic of repatriation, in the past you guys have talked about tapping into un-invested foreign earnings not just U.S. cash, so should we view the $24 billion you mentioned Frank is the ceiling for repatriation or you still evaluating? And then more on the pipeline; when you think about Pfizer's IO strategy in moving beyond avelumab and 4-1BB, what\u2019s the capacity or should say the priority to expand the number of IO combinations, I know you guys are looking at OX40, but obviously room for many more combos and maybe what\u2019s the rate limiting step for that tap? Thanks.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. On the 24 billion is the ceiling on the repatriation, of course, it does mean that all future cash flows can come back to the U.S. without restriction, which I think is the really important point rather than the 24 billion we\u2019re bringing back. It\u2019s unfreezing [ph] permanently of our access to our global capital cash flows.","Ian Read","And it\u2019s up 24 billion.","Frank D'Amelio","And it\u2019s up 24 billion. IO strategy, Mikael please.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you. We look at IO field development into three buckets as part of your question. Initial monotherapy with PD-1, PD-L1 including our Bavencio combinations of those agents with chemo-targeted agents or IO agents and three longer-term aiming [Indiscernible]. In the first bucket we are present mainly as a minor player with Bavencio approvals in Merkel cell, bladder cancer and plan readout lung cancer. We didn't really plan to be a leader in the space.","However we\u2019re really aim to grow impactful leadership with Bavencio in segments of combinations, which are near and mid-term promising opportunity. We have now five pivotal studies over the next 18 to 24 months with various Bavencio combinations that we think will be really interesting to watch. Ovarian second-line and third-line with chemo, renal first-line in lighten Bavencio, gastric first-line on maintenance of Bavencio after chemo bladder first-line, maintenance of Bavencio of the chemo ovarian, Bavencio combined with various chemo combinations.","In addition to those pivotal readout in the more near-term, we mid-term see more than 20 Bavencio combinations whether radio immunotherapy pivotal studies in head and neck or with our vast number of targeted agents which is really unique aspect of Pfizer compared to many other place in this space that includes for lung, [Indiscernible] XALKORI, for breast with Ibrance for breast trend, for leukemias and myeloid corrected with glasdegib, and of course we are conducting additional IO studies with 4-1BB combined with OX40 where we have encouragement that this may from an immune point of view will be a real interesting combination.","And finally, I want to say that we are really one of the few that have both an IO agent Bavencio and a PARP inhibitor talazoparib and we do think that will be a very powerful combination and we\u2019re running broad basket studies over many solid tumors and expect opportunities to take from those dataset into pivotal studies in the near term. The longer term bucket was aim to turn cold tumors hot and we have invested in numerous platforms that which combined with PD-1 or avelumab such as cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, antibody drug conjugate where we have Phase 1, 2 studies with PTK7 were non-particles loaded with various immune targeted agents and finally bifunctional antibodies.","Ian Read","Thanks Mikael. That\u2019s a comprehensive review. And of course you know immuno-oncology is one stool of our oncology platform because we\u2019re both in breast, we\u2019re in targeted agents, we\u2019re in prostate cancer, and so I think we have a very robust overall strategy. I would like to point out that while we are behind in lung now our expectations are we have two important readouts; one this year and one later on which is in \u2013 we have very creative design and let\u2019s see what results are in lung and how positive it can be. We haven't anyway given up and our attempt to participate in that large market. Thank you very much.","Charles Triano","Well, thank you, Ian and Mikael. Next question please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford","Thanks very much. My first question is just on the second generation Ibrance product that you have. And there\u2019s specific resistance mechanisms that you\u2019re identifying within Ibrance\u2019s patients. And I wonder if you can talk a little bit about those and how this convinced them? And then the second big picture question, obviously you guys have look to the potential separation of the essential health business in the past. You did talk about a number of factors that influence that decision not to do before. I am just wondering if now we have a tax reform in place whether that potentially influences that decision going forward and when you might next look at that again. Thank you very much.","Ian Read","Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019ll ask Albert to \u2013 sorry, Mikael to discuss the second generation as you\u2019ve named it for Ibrance\u2019s agents.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you. We have two current approaches to deal with resistance to CDK and breast cancer. We are starting this quarter as our plans with a second generation CDK drug and that\u2019s based on unique proprietary science that we have performed to identify resistance mechanisms that can occur related to the cell cycle. And we look forward very much to start it up in breast and it also application outside of breast as a resistance mechanism.","And second resistance we have noted is related to targeted phosphate PS3K and we have a phase 1B study with a unique inhibit to get a policy and I\u2019ve seen so far encouraging data and are expanding those studies.","Ian Read","Thank you. Why don\u2019t we go to Frank for the discussion of the separation?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. Jeff, one optionality, if you\u2019ll recall we had laid out four questions. So, was the business performing well inside the company? We\u2019re continued to perform well on a standalone basis. Was there trap value? Can we unlock that trap value in a tax efficient way. So let's focus on questions three and four. With tax reform, now the question four is yes, to the extent that there is trapped value we believe we would be able to analyze that trapped value in tax efficient way. But let's really zoom in on question three which is their trap value? When we announced we look at optionality, specialty form of valuations have price-earnings multiples that were 20-ish. If you look today that we\u2019ve cut roughly in half, so we really don't see any trap value. So our current view is for the foreseeable future where the key for our essential business is execution. That\u2019s to really get that business right to do.","Now deal with our sterile injectables, continue to grow biosimilars, continue to grow an emerging markets and continue to manage our peri-LOE products as effectively as possible. So that's our view for the foreseeable future.","Ian Read","Great. Thank you, Frank. Next question please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. ","Jason Gerberry","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. First I just want you to get your guys perspective on 2018 M&A evaluations that are getting paid. And I think investors and even company management teams have been vocal that these evaluations have been pretty lofty. So just kind of curious to get your perspective on evaluation, certainly seems like a seller\u2019s market.","And then secondly on Xtandi, can you comment a little bit year-to-date 2018 the dynamic between the PIP and the co-pay foundation, I realize you have no line of sight into the co-pay foundation, but potentially you have a line of sight in to the PIP. So just kind of wondering if the patients are being funnelled in a way that will improve revenue recognition or revenue generation with Xtandi patient in 2018? Thanks.","Ian Read","Well, vis-\u00e0-vis the evaluations, I mean, every deal is a deal by deal. So it's very difficult for us to assess the value transactions on deals because it's not clear what the opportunities that with the specific assets and researching capabilities companies have when they pay for these assets. They would appear to be in terms P [ph] and multiples, lofty prices, but once again everybody does their own deals and every deal is specific.","So we will continue to look for value in the BD space and when we find it we have the capability and the capability to operate on it. With that I\u2019ll ask Albert to discuss the issues around and the dynamic.","Albert Bourla","Jason, look, I have no visibility in what is going on with in terms of co-pay foundations. I know because they have made publicly available, but we are contributing, but I'm aware of the amount that we\u2019re giving by quarter by month, because we have established very strong -- let me call it, Chinese wall between our commercial operations and the groups that they are contributing to this foundations.","What I know, it is only -- how many are enrolling in the commercial free goods, which is the patient assistance program. And this is what I said before, but in the fourth quarter it was the same more or less amount percentage wise as we had in the third quarter. And from the first indications that they can see how many are enrolling in 2018, I expect this number to the lower in [Indiscernible] even 2017 [ph].","Charles Triano","Thanks, Albert. Our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the solid results. So Ian just going back to the question on M&A going forward, I think you previously mentioned that you essentially want to take a pause on large-scale type of M&A until tax reform within the rear view mirror and how things shook out on repatriation. I think you\u2019ve also provided some commentary that there were some significant binary events that would have to occur going forward to also for consideration on larger scale M&A. Just wondering how the tax outlook shapes that view going forward?","Second question for on tax, tax rate goes down by 500 basis points. Can you just walk us through the pushes and pulls of what's going on with the international subsidiaries that cause that 500 basis point contraction? And then why the tax rate wouldn\u2019t continue to go down as you do and certainly how does that influence your tax planning going forward? And then that last question just on tafamidis. Cardiomyopathy and the trial of potential readout, what do you potentially expect out of that? Is there are potentially mortality outcome out of that? And you can you contrast the drug with myeloma [ph] and Ioannis drugs that are being studied in that area? Thanks.","Ian Read","Okay. So on M&A, I think we\u2019ve been recently consistent over the years when we discussed M&A to say that we had the capacity before tax reform to do M&A, in fact we attempt to do two large ones, which was thwarted by government interventions. So the tax reform was really more important in -- from the point of view M&A or the point of view of how you would finance the deal or what the relative values of companies would be. And I expect to see some changes in that as some premiums for previously established tax advantages for certain companies disappear, but it doesn't really change the underlying focus of how we look at M&A and how we look at that the disposition of our capital that Frank talked about earlier.","So we\u2019ll continue to look at M&A for the point of view of value for our shareholders. And we\u2019ll be directed by the science and the opportunities. And we\u2019re also look at opportunities across the other spectrums, which is the dividends and the buybacks and investment in the business. So I think which is really a continuation of a very thoughtful I believe from the part of you at Pfizer of deployment of capital. Frank, do you want to answer the tax rate please.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. John, let me run the numbers just to grant everybody. So we had guided this year to approximately 23%. Now obviously we\u2019re giving guidance for next year is 17%, so approximately 600 basis point decrease in the tax rate year-over-year. Now in terms of the going forward rate, I had answer really that for modeling purposes we should assume that that 17% -- approximately 17% was sustainable. And you asked me about kind of the international impact with our subsidiaries. I mean, at a macro level the way to think about this is we do business in over 150 countries. Every country obviously has their own tax structure, their own tax rates.","Some of our business is outside the U.S., the major part of business is inside the U.S. The new corporate tax rate going forward is 21%. On overseas earnings we have now territorial system, but with the minimum tax of 10.5 %. When you do all the work and all the tax planning and we work through everything, the blended rate gets us to that approximately 70% diluted too. So going forward you all should expect us to sustain give or take a 70% tax rate.","Charles Triano","Mikael, do you want to take on the tafamidis please.","Mikael Dolsten","Sure. We have tafamidis study for cardiomyopathy. As you know the drug is registered in Europe to deal what\u2019s call TTR amyloid polyneuropathy. This study in cardiac condition is 400 subjects and the first and largest study in this important segment including both patient limitation and the large population with excess of amulet but no mutation, we expect readout first half of this year and pending the data we will then consider further potential regulatory action.","It's of course the first of its kind in this rare disease. So, there is high-risk but also very high upside given that this is a much larger population than neuropathy and a very few treatment. This is Polaroid drug and deferred from injectables such as oligonucleotides that you referred to. We look really forward to do readout and to review it.","Charles Triano","Thanks, Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Greg Gilbert ","Thank you. First on the innovative side, for you new JAK, can you talk in some more detail about how you\u2019ll develop it and differentiate versus Xeljanz over the longer term, and versus other JAKs in the space? And then shifting over to the essential side, Just questioning whether you are manufacturing and supply chain network that\u2019s where it needs to be there. It sounds like you describe that is more of fixing legacy problem versus sort of investing new capital. Can you shed some more light on the strategy there? Is it sort of a set of expensive bandage or it\u2019s there a fundamentally new approach to have success on the essential side? And lastly what your plan to do with your own biosimilar version of remicade which would presumably be more profitable then the Celltrion version? Thanks.","Ian Read","Hi. You know, Greg, thanks for the questions. Just good to see lot of questions on our pipeline as it becomes into focus. Mikael, would you like to talk about the JAK1 and JAKs?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you. So we have six next generation immunokinases including five oral and they have been uniquely design to go into areas where we think the first generation of JAKs such as the Xeljanz is less optimal. And while we\u2019re very excite about Xeljanz\u2019s strong performance in array and if possible further expansion into ulcerative colitis. We have JAK1 as you noted went to into Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis and have a unique profile for that. We have a two JAK1 that is targeted to the mechanism between psoriasis and Crohn's, which is colitis, where JAK3 selective into RA and in term we look at interesting conditions such as alopecia where two of these JAKs again, uniquely targeted.","So the whole story is to going to other areas were Xeljanz may not be fully optimized while we think we can grow Xeljanz rheumatology and select segment of G.I. but now we target broader diseases within arm G.I. but then beyond Xeljanz. So we hope to expand the opportunity for JAK and obviously, also plan for live cycle management on Xeljanz.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael. So, in reality we belief from the Science of the Jack who been investing in for over 10 years, we can bring significant relief to specific patients segments with this specificity of the JAKs that we\u2019ve developed and this would be the sort of backbone of our strategy and our competitive advantage. So that\u2019s very good.","Now I\u2019ll go to, we can ask the biosimilars and also\u2026","Mikael Dolsten","And manufacturing.","Ian Read","Please, Mikael, please go ahead.","John Young","So thanks for the questions, Greg. So look, as Ian mentioned in his comments, the essential healthy portfolio we\u2019ve obviously been an experiencing some supply shortage with some products. The shortage is of primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio. And as Ian said there are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues.","Let me just make a comment and say there obviously as we said before during the Hospira acquisition we were aware that there are manufacturing issues that were confirm during the due-diligent process, but we have a robust action plan in place and we believe that we\u2019ll make progress during 2018 towards reducing sterile injectable shortages and that will include investing capital in those specific plans.","Turing now to our own infliximab by biosimilar. As you know in Inflectra\u2019s existing marketed infliximab biosimilar is currently available in the U.S. and it will continue to be available to patients and physicians. Although we\u2019re very pleased with the U.S. FDA approval of IXIFI as the first Pfizer developed biosimilar in the U.S. Pfizer doesn\u2019t currently plan on launching IXIFI in the U.S. and we\u2019re evaluating our strategic options for this product.","Ian Read","Thank you, John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Ian, I think in the past you have as an industry leader have spoken about the inevitability about industry consolidation. Today\u2019s news about the Amazon partnership, consistent pricing pressure, the Hillary tweet, I think that\u2019s when you started talking about it, but we really haven\u2019t seen it in the last wave of large scale deals was back in 2009. And today on the call you\u2019re saying that there is less reason to do a tax deal obviously because of tax reform. And the spin is probably off the table now, because you don\u2019t see trapped value. I\u2019m just wondering if you still see value and industry consolidation from synergies and scale. That is something you really haven\u2019t touched upon.","And if you do, do you see Pfizer as a consolidator as you been in the past. Or do you think you will continue down the path of smaller scale BD activity? Thanks very much.","John Young","Thanks Jami. I do believe that given the pressures being applied by the consolidation in the payer network and the pressure there exists on governments to find ways of curtailing overall health care costs, while I'm optimistic that actually drugs will play a bigger part in that as being very cost effective, I do believe there'll be a need to further consolidation to deal with the size of our customers and the size of the opportunities.","I think these things come in waves. I think everybody is looking at potential combinations and consolidations. I can't tell you when it will start, but I believe there will be moments when there is a key detonator to initiation of further consolidation.","But we are -- I would say, we have a core competency in consolidation of large companies into Pfizer. We will -- if there is an opportunity for shareholder additional value consolidation, I expect that Pfizer would be at the forefront of it. At the same time, we'd also be looking at deals of a different size.","We never say never to big deals, but we also say we can -- we think we have the capacity to do both the small deals and the big deal when the moment arises. And we know we also -- by the way, I'm just getting some flags here from Frank. I think that we don't feel any pressure to immediately do any type of deal in the sense that we've just had a very good year in 2017. We're going to have a good year in 2018. We have very good franchises with -- focused on developing our own pipeline.","That being said, we are opportunistic in looking for intellectual property that we can buy and do better than the present owners. We continue to look at that. And so I'm very optimistic about our hand and all the arrows that we have to fire in our arsenal. Thank you, Jami.","Charles Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. A couple of questions please. First to Ian and Albert, despite the rhetoric which [Indiscernible] could have done to the industry given the last question on 340B hospitals, the proposal for PMBs to part from new base and you made the right action on drug pricing. The -- together with the new Head of HSS, reiterated his comments. And I'm just interested how you quantify the risk or whether you think it's more na\u00efve? Does it impact how you look at M&A valuation? In such that you believe there is risk, are you more concerned of drugs under pharmacy versus medical benefit? So, that's my first question.","The second question is whether you could comment on the market pricing dynamic for new molecule oncology given the density in this area to parts of CDK 4\/6, that when you're seeing net pricing is going to come under much more pressure than maybe we should be thinking about?","And then finally, for Mikael, could you talk to Pfizer's biomarker adoption beyond PD-L1, particularly human mutational burden and how you're implementing that within your oncology take [ph] and would you might like to comment on your foundation recent relationship? Thank you.","Ian Read","So Andrew, thank you for those three questions, all very powerful and all very extensive. I think on the question of the pricing risk, this industry has, for decades, had a pricing risk present in its commercial business. And in fact, we've highlighted that in our -- on our 10-Qs and things like that.","So, I don't see that the pricing risk has dramatically changed from where it was 10 years ago or five years ago. I believe that we need to be in a constant dialogue with society and with payers and the government over the value of pharmaceuticals.","I think that dialogue is ongoing with both the administration and Congress. And I think the dialogue is being informed by facts. And we are looking for ways, as you've mentioned, to lower the cost, the out-of-pocket cost of patients. The fundamental problem is not, I believe, the pricing of products. The fundamental -- because to be able to fund and run a modern innovative pharmaceutical company, there's a certain level of resources necessary. And unless we see a breakthrough in innovation and a breakthrough in the process, this is the cost of bringing products to market.","The question is does society want to continue to support that innovation? I think the answer is absolutely yes. The next question is how will society ensure access to those products? So, this is really about how you ensure people, do rebates, get to the point-of-sale, where we think they ought to be. How do you make drugs affordable? Right now the system is set up adversely to transfer the costs of lowering premiums to healthy people on the sick people. I don't think that's a good policy and we're in discussions with the government to change that. So, I think this pricing risk is reversed. I think it remains reversed, and it's a constant issue that the industry needs to deal with given the nature of the marketplace.","On your question about the density of small molecules, to a certain extent I would apply that to the density of PD-L1s. I don't think it's specific to small molecules, I think the pricing always rests on the value of the products bring to the society. And we will continue to develop innovative products that have differences compared to this and we will expect to earn a reasonable return on those products. So, there was one other question on the PD-L1. Mikael, do you want to talk to that?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, I'll be brief. We started with PD-L1 as what was the initial most frequent used. And for some tumors, like lung useful biomarker, we are now assessing tumor mutation burden, clearly you have good insight into this field. And our innovation that we will see in the future studies to start, maybe even a combination of PD-L1 and TMB. Exploratory markers include immune cell subset, T-cell repertoire sequencing, and then combination drug-specific choices.","Charles Triano","Thanks Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler","Yes, thanks very much. Two questions, please. One, Mikael, in first-line renal cell carcinoma, you've got very interesting trial with Inlyta. Obviously, there will be an IO\/IO combination, I suspect, in the market by the time your trial reads out, but I'm most interested in whether or not you think that Inlyta or tyrosine kinase inhibitor actually improves the synergy with Bavencio?","And then second, still within oncology, if I might ask, clearly you're in a little bit euphoria around the CAR-T space and I recognize you all have an interest in and off-the-shelf first once selected and I'm just curious if you might comment, yet again, on whether you're ramping up some efforts there.","And then, finally, Frank, once again, on taxes, if I may. LOEs are diminishing. You've clearly stated that your U.S. business is doing extremely well, disproportionately I might add. So, the U.S. percentage of your total business increases. And again, I have to ask, given those, unless there's something which we totally miss, why doesn't again tax change, certainly out in the future beyond 2017. Sorry for that, but thanks.","Ian Read","Okay, I'll ask Mikael to address your first question.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, we do think that combining Inlyta with Bavencio is really a unique combination for renal cell carcinoma, and that data as reported were really impressive and, at least to me, I believe it stands out among the absolutely best seen this far.","Inlyta targets the micro environment as the BDF inhibitor, so I think it has unique position, and we view it currently as really promising, and the preference for us then adding more immuno-oncology agent as we see a very high responsive. And we look really forward to the readout that will come within the next 12 months or so from this study.","Ian Read","Thank you. On the question of CAR-T, we have seen the explosion of interest. We do have an off-the-shelf version as you say it, which we're developing with Cellectis. We are currently looking at our strategy of how to ensure that those -- that product can get to patients in the most rapid and effective way and we'll be looking at our strategy around CAR-Ts. And then the last question -- okay.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes, on the tax rate. Yes, so Tony, in terms of the overall business, if you look at last year, 2016, roughly 50% of our revenues were in the U.S. 50% of our revenues were outside of the U.S. If you look at 2017 about 49% of our revenues were in the U.S. about 51% were outside the U.S. So not a lot of change, but not \u2013 be a little bit more pointed towards the international part of the business.","When we put all that together, when we look at where the mix of our business is, when we look at the countries we do business in, where we manufacture our products, where we ship from, I\u2019m currently comfortable with the 17% and my statement about sustaining that 17% beyond 2018.","Charles Triano","Thank you Frank for covering that. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe coming back to business development, I know the return seemed to be there, you\u2019ve highlighted you are agnostic to size, but given where the business in the pipeline stands today, I guess ideally what are you trying to achieve? Is it focused on enhancing near term growth? Is it more of a long term growth? Do you want to stay using verticals? Do you want to add verticals? Try and understand a little bit more what the strategic priorities are as you consider deals before you think about the financial terms associated with them? ","And my second question was on the Prevnar outlook for 2018, are we still expecting the U.S. adult business to be under pressure and can growth elsewhere in the franchise start to offset that erosion as we think about the 2018 outlook? Thanks very much.","Ian Read","Thank you Chris. On BD, I mean we look at across the spectrum with BD from near term to long term. Clearly if assets were available at appropriate valuations, we would have a preference for short-term acceleration in our revenue growth and our EPS growth. On the other hand if there is availability of different deal which also produces value or it may take longer i.e. through consolidation and things like that we would also be interested in that and continue to look across that spectrum.","I think we are well positioned. We can be considerate any options we look at and we do have a certain sense of urgency to find deals that would accelerate our revenue and EPS growth. You know with that, we\u2019ll go to Prevnar.","Albert Bourla","Chris, you're right. We do expect that there will be a pressure in the adult sales in the U.S. which will be less as the product is coming more to a stable state. But this will be offset by higher paediatric sales globally. And we do not provide guidance or specific products because this is already incorporated in the guidance that Frank gave. But I can tell you in general terms that Prevnar will be roughly flat in 2018 compared to 2017.","Charles Triano","Thanks Albert. Next question, please operator","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you see your international sales of Enbrel; evolving from here as we move into 2018 relative to what we saw in 2017, further the levels of price erosion, volume loss and that sort of thing. In 2017 sales were down about 15% versus the prior year, is that the sort of contraction that you expect we\u2019ll see in 2018 as well as future years beyond that so maybe 15% per year. I\u2019m trying to understand what your long term modeling shows in setting the path somewhere?","And then second question there is continued or I should say renewed interest recently on the topic of whether PD-1s and PD-L1 ones are the same, the argument being that PD-1s might offer better efficacy because of mechanistic differences. Wondering what Pfizer\u2019s current view of this debate is?","Ian Read","Okay, Tim on Enbrel thanks for the question as you know we don\u2019t give product specific forecast but I think the range as you described in your opening commentary is aligned within internal channel thinking about the way that franchise will be managed over the future.","PD-1, PD-L1 might not...","Frank D'Amelio","Yes, I would start to say that we have a unique situation that we actually have one PD-L1 Bavencio and one PD-1 and the PD-1 is right now in studies with our cancer vaccines, very well behaving. It has potential for subcute monthly administration. On the other hand we are very pleased with our PD-L1 that is more advanced and we monitor carefully what you said, where did our any new date that would indicate under certain specialized setting that one would be better than the other. But in the big picture, I think they look pretty similar overall within these two classes.","Ian Read","Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman","Yes, morning. I got a couple of questions. First, Albert in the past we've talked about there's a new competition will come in with CDK is whether you had to take any price and I was curious whether you've had to take any price, now that there are three in order to maintain the dominant share you have.","Second question is consumer, if you could just refer to the U.S. business and handle a little week in the quarter. And then third question to Newsome. Have you talked about six phase III studies? Can you tell us how many you're expecting to actually report out this year? Thanks.","Ian Read","Okay. Albert, if you want to take the Ibrance and the consumer?","Albert Bourla","Yes. Marc, so far despite the press over, they need incumbant product phase is when multiple compared to center of the market. We have not seen any material importance on my branch performance. We believe that positive results from the other CDK inhibitor, that must try the significance of CDK inhibition and will benefit a class overall.","It's important to remember that almost 60% of newly diagnosed patients were assuming a CDK but only 50% of the total with relation. So, that they must raise the potential to grow the class. Within this class, we remain very confident, in high branch leadership based on the strength of free data, efficasy safety profile and that can go on and one.","Importantly, you know that there is no clinic available in [indiscernible] that was observed across the along the trials. There is no requirement for ACC or GAT IOP and CCT monitoring in the current prescribing information. There is no requirement for monitoring the signs and symptoms of thrombotic events or precautions of.","We feel that three years in the market with this as we said very large market's there. 11,000 prescribers, more than 100,000 patients, we feel we are very strong with that.","Marc Goodman","And I believe on the value we're receiving it remains consistent with our previous years' experience and I'm not seeing any undue pressure due to the competition on our pricing, given the profile Albert just described for the except for Ibrance consumers performance.","Albert Bourla","Consumer area, Frank has spoke about that. We had a 2% growth and this was affected mainly by the U.S. the U.S. was declining 2% and in the fourth quarter we're decling 2%. And then the U.S. that will drove this decline was my mistake. And the reasons or such the negative of impact of hurricane Maria, in Portorico but also the U.S. were impacted by maximum how to see LOE about to happen in this quarter.","As Frank emphasized, this business is performing at 5% every year, that was in the last three years and we are hoping to see it coming back to this level of performace this year.","Ian Read","Okay, Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So, we'll have the first shot the 16 week efficasy trial reading out these all followed by the slightly longer 24, 56, week and safety trials in a way and turn it lower back pain for the U.S. and newer markets reading out the first few months of 2019. And that will really constitute the data package for potential filing consideration pending data for the major markets.","And then we have other smaller studies for Japan and cancer pain later on.","Ian Read","Right, thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a few questions on Ibrance's EU price. Could you give us examples of the pricing analogs to which you're referring? Secondly, Pfizer had been saying that essential health would return to growth in a couple of years, now that via the U.S. is an essential health and presumably Lyrica U.S. will be moving over in the future.","How does this affect this essential health's return to growth timing? And then lastly, Inflectra U.S. increased 10 million quarter-over-quarter or a bit less than 1% of market share increase. Is that a trajectory we should be expecting going forward or should we anticipate some sort of inflection? Thank you.","Frank D'Amelio","Thank you, Steve. I dont really for proprietory reasons on pricing, I dont want to get into analogs. I would say that we are satisfied in the European context of the reimbursement price we got. It was very hard negotiations but in the end in old patient access was important as well as the reimbursement price.","We think we arrived at a fair compromise on that. And we think we have a basis for vibrant growth at an appropriate price for Ibrance in Europe. And I think that's the most important thing to look at there.","The, could John, would you take the other questions?","John Young","Yes. So, thanks for the questions, Steve. So, we have consistently said over the last two to three years that we expect the essential health business to return to growth in the medium term. And actually, that remains our view, that actually as the head wins from major LOEs and the portfolio that are currently sits with MP EH begin to lessen.","And we're seeing for example in 2017, the impact of LOEs were something like 1.4 billion in this business. Expected that would kind of shrink to around about 900 million in 2018, given the portfolio. Combined with the continued growth of emerging markets, combined with the continued growth of biosimilar.","So, when you put all those things together, we continue to expect that actually in the near term that actually essential health is poised to deliver modest single-digit growth. We still feel that that is a sustainable pattern of growth for this business.","In relation to Inflectra in the U.S. let me just sort of say first of all Inflectra globally had revenues of a $135 million the quarter. That was a 110% increase or $70 million or $68 million growth. Actually a $41 million increase in the U.S. so, once we commented in answers to some other questions about some of the challenges in terms of access due to J&J's exclusion contracting, we expect to continue to make progress in the U.S. with Inflectra in the course of 2018.","Ian Read","Right. Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is John Miller [ph] on for Umer. A couple of questions, at JP Morgan, you showed an interesting slide titled step change and further R&D productivity and everyone think on that was LOE on combination.","So, how do you think your internal IOIO portfolio measures up against external and hove your thoughts changed based on the early results from JAVELIN Medley. Secondly, Frank, the 17% rate tax going forward, is the if your efficacy's a non-GAAP tax rate is going to be consistent with the cash tax rate.","And last, I noticed you guys have an oral GLP-1 in Phase 1. Are you looking at that more in diabetes or in that?","Ian Read","Okay. We'll as Mikael to answer the question research and then Frank will answer the tax question.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you for noting our up to 15 and five subject to attrition. That's typical in development blockbuster projections for the next five years. As you noted, it contained actually a five oppertunities in oncology. And the first one included Bavencio mono and combos for IOIO.","And we clearly continue to be positive about Bavencio's quality tier 1 and then eluded to certain trials coming up soon. And we follow we had a significant interest the triplet combo we do 4-1BB. We also as I spoke earlier to have numerous pivotal study readouts with combinations of chemo and targeted agent and actually more than 20 of such combinations overall in the portfolio.","So, I think there is ample opportunity for us to make very valuable contribution and in this field through IOIO targeted and chemo combinations. And that's a very important part of our strategy.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. And then on the GAAP tax rate versus the 17%. 17% obviously is an adjusted results tax rate. The GAAP rate versus the adjusted, we'll see first relations quarter-to-quarter based on the counting that we're doing for various items. That we quarter to have significant items, some positive, some negative. Example this port there are 2+ significant items to the reversal 10.7 billion in primarily U.S. deffered tax liabilities which cause incredibly negative tax rate.","So, it will be volatile, every fluctuations for quarter-to-quarter, differences between GAAP and the adjusted results as there has been in the past.","Ian Read","And Mikael, just on the GLP-1.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, thank you for noting that. We are really excited about this oral GLP-1. Small molecule we think maybe the first real small molecule nature to the newer studies. And we look upon initial opportunity, NASH and joint reflect such as obesity.","But certainly we look at this profile also for treating diabetes where these drug class has been so successful as injectable and of course and oral drug with a unique profile seems very attractive across entire metabolic spectrum.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael. And we'll take our last question now, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick ones. Ian, can you just give us your big picture thoughts on Eliquis and its overall opportunity growth continues to be pretty spectacular given where this product is in its life cycle.","Just wondering if you think given where we are in the developed world in terms of global markets overall, if this could possibly exceed LIPITOR sales at peak. The second question, as we think about your pricing analogs in the discussion around international pricing of Ibrance.","Is it wrong to think that this may in fact anticipate success in the augment setting so that there wouldn\u2019t be another step down in pricing as that patient population grows substantially? And then the last question is on the PARP as we think about the opportunity for talazoparib.","What is Pfizer doing in prostate cancer, given some early data there for a combination of talazoparib with Xtandi? Thanks so much for the question.","Ian Read","Thank you. I'm going let Albert in his capacity to take over so the Eliquis questions and the pricing on Ibrance and then Mikael can also tell the questions. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","So, let's start with Eliquis. Yes, we are very optimistic for Eliquis. We expect the growth will continue. The next leg of growth will be driven by increased knock penetration of the market and increase Eliquis surgain of the class of non-flus. And this, so again it's expected to be at two by increasing focus on the following strategic intiatives.","We are going to accelerate markets are gaining with the market. In those markets who have achieved the leadershiop position in the risk reduction already of stroke systemic embolis. We're going to generate and utilize local readable data to see preferencial access for Eliquis.","And we have very good demonstration of this value so far with the first studies that do that that for. That they're getting the attention of peers. And of course we're going to increase diagnosis of the NVIF patients in those markets who have achieved already a leadership poasition in the risk reduction of stroke.","And you saw are very positive.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Concerning tell us a period. We are very excited about that drug profile. Did our report of the EMBRACA trial in breast cancer while we had a nice superiority to chemo therapy and at the end of very favorable profile.","So, we are looking forward to additional readouts for talazoparib and investment in a drug and we've two prostate cancer studies. One, that was recently initiated in combination when salute are made or Xtandi in a selected subset of prostate cancer and we also have a more advanced posted cancer in open sing-along trial that could be of potential feel about the character.","And then where we invest this significantly in combination with Bavencio for what we think will be a number of different holotypes. So, I look forward to continue the dialogue as we advanced. What I think is the potential best-in-class popping EBITDA.","Thanks, Mikael. We'll just now go back to Albert for another comment.","Albert Bourla","Yes, because i forgot to mention to answer your question about Ibrance. First of all, I cannot say if it would be bigger. When Lipitor what I can say it is going to be. And then wish about what I want to say. Then early whisper what I want to say it is that this is an extremely appealing opportunity for us.","And a big part of the opportunities as we alluded comes from advancement or five brands into the early settings of treatment. We have three studies that are related with [Indiscernible] two are Phase 3 studies. And is PENELOPE [ph] but it is in high risk breast cancer and that will become very good towards the end of 2020.","And the other one it is the PALLAS, that it is with intermediate risk early breast cancer and that will come a little bit earlier in the third quarter of 2020. Of course also we had pallet. The \u2013 in totality the early breast cancer represents very big opportunity because they will show you the number of patients is more than double and also the economy, the financial opportunities are just because you have much longer duration of treatments. I don\u2019t think that its early to speak about pricing as you eluded because those are coming in the 21 timeframe for negotiations with payers.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert. So the pricing analog of your question of whether the overall survival data that matures in Ibrance will influence the pricing in Europe is a good question, the one that really is relatively remote. It\u2019s going to take three years to get that data and assuming the data is positive I would expect us to relocate the value of Ibrance and if it was negative which is a very \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult in this type of long, long, long disease progression to get any really accurate information I would expect that the use of Ibrance will be very well entrenched in the patterns of treatment by physicians by that time. Thank you.","Charles Triano","Thanks. And thanks everybody for your attention today.","Ian Read","Thanks everybody.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s first quarter 2015 performance. I am joined here today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance First Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of the page.","Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussions in the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today.","We will now make some prepared remarks and then we will move to a Q&A session. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you Chuck and good morning everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter, provide some thoughts about the pipeline and close with a few comments about actions we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our core businesses.","Starting with the quarter, our performance for the quarter was solid with good performance on both top and bottom-line. Overall, revenues grew by 2% operationally even with a negative impact from the loss of exclusivity of Celebrex in U.S. and the end of Spiriva co-promotion agreement also in the U.S. In addition, we saw 12% operational growth in emerging markets, driven by both our GEP and Innovative businesses.","While majority of LOEs and co-promote expiries are behind us, we still face some LOEs this year and next, making it difficult to generate revenue growth despite the strong performance of our newest products. That said, we believe the impact from any remaining LOEs will diminish over time as we continue to see a building revenue base resulting from investments we\u2019ve made in key growth areas and recent product launches.","I\u2019ll touch upon some noteworthy areas. Prevenar 13 had a very strong quarter, particularly in the U.S. where revenues increased 80% this was primarily due to strong uptake amongst adults 65 years of age and older following the positive recommendation from U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as well as the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication compared to the year ago quarter.","Revenues for the adult indication were approximately $300 million in the quarter. Physicians\u2019 response to Prevenar 13 continues to build steadily and our strong Q1 sales suggest these physicians are actively vaccinating adults who have never been vaccinated as well as those who were previously vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX from Merck. Each year several million people in the U.S. turn 65 who are eligible to receive Prevenar 13. And of those adults in the U.S. who are already 65, there are many millions eligible that have never been vaccinated or were previously vaccinated. We are increasing awareness amongst adults about the seriousness of pneumococcal pneumonia and the importance of talking to their physicians or pharmacists about vaccination to protect them from its devastating effects.","We believe our efforts are increasing the sense of urgency to vaccinate and driving consumers to request the Prevenar vaccine. In December, CMS changed their guidance to cover both pneumococcal vaccines which ensures coverage for senior 65 years and older under Medicare Part D, aligning with a positive ASIP recommendations from August 2014.","Eliquis is gaining significant momentum worldwide as it continues to increase share amongst cardiologists who recently -- and recently has become the number one oral anticoagulant that\u2019s NOAC prescribed by cardiologists for new to brand patients in the United States and Japan. In addition, Eliquis is now the number one NOAC prescribed by cardiologists for new to brand patients for the nonvalvular atrial fibrillation indication in the UK and Spain and we\u2019re continuing to see increasing uptake in Germany.","We are pleased with the continued progress Xeljanz has made towards becoming a key product based on approvals in 40 countries in rheumatoid arthritis, launches and revenue growth of the RA indication and the initiation of filing for the potential second indication in plaques psoriasis.","In the U.S. rheumatologists\u2019 satisfaction with the product continues to be positive, Xeljanz now ranks number three amongst rheumatologists in new to brand prescription share of self administrated rheumatoid arthritis therapies and is on track to become the third new to brand therapy overall in the U.S.","We have put significant focus and resources behind building our oncology business. The portfolio was strengthened with some recent advancements. In February, we received accelerated approval from the FDA for Ibrance and have quickly launched in the U.S. While it is still very early, I\u2019m extremely pleased with its performance. Physicians have been embracing the product; the number of new patient starts have been increasing since the FDA approval and we are seeing early success of reimbursement to date. The Ibrance team has done a remarkable job in ensuring we were able to get the product to patients as quickly as possible following approval.","We also announced this month a Phase 3 trial of Ibrance for recurrent breast cancer had met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. We will be presenting detailed efficacy and safety results from PALOMA-3 at the upcoming ASCO. In addition, we have several presentations at ASCO including oral data presentations for our immune-oncology asset 4-1BB and avelumab, the PD-L1 being co-developed for alliance with Merck KGa.","Also last week we announced another encouraging development in our oncology pipeline, a Phase 3 trial for inotuzumab met the primary end point of demonstrating a higher complete hematological remission rate in adults who relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to that achieved with standard of care chemotherapy. We\u2019re discussing these data with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. The trial will continue to evaluate overall survival which is a separate primary end point; the data will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings.","I believe our recent accomplishments and news flow in research and development demonstrate that we are in one of the most productive times for our pipeline. We have strong presence in the areas where the science is quickly moving where there is market potential where we believe we have clinical differentiation most importantly where the patients\u2019 needs are the greatest.","Today we published a comprehensive update of the pipeline; you will see that we have a rich modality mix across small and large molecules and vaccines, novel mechanisms and potential new indications. This includes the development of bococizumab; the ongoing development of Xeljanz; a CDK 4\/6 platform with Ibrance; a comprehensive immune-oncology program with our partner Merck KGa for the first wave of potential single agent mono-therapy treatment regimes with several tumor types and assets to position us for the next wave of potential I\/O combination therapies including 4-1BB, OX40 and ADCs.","Vaccines for Staph aureus and C difficile, a next generation ALK\/ROS1 inhibitor, a world leading kinase capability with unique JAK drugs in development, a strong rare disease portfolio in the areas of hematology, neuroscience inherent to metabolic disorders and pulmonology, our novel neuroscience work in Parkinson\u2019s and our development portfolio of monoclonal biosimilars continues to progress well with full products now in Phase 3 development.","In total, we have 88 programs in clinical development with the 30 programs in late stage development or registration as of today. Over the last several years, we have rebuilt the pipeline and transformed our approach to R&D and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to bring forth over the next several years therapies that will significantly improve people\u2019s lives.","Now for a few comments on how we continue to take steps to expand our sources of revenue and strengthen our core businesses. As always, we continue to look for business development opportunities that will create value with the bias towards deals with a potential for creating value in the near-term. M&A activity in the pharma space has been very active recently and Pfizer regularly reviews potential opportunities but remains disciplined with our shareholders\u2019 capital to ensure transactions we may pursue generate an appropriate return for our shareholders.","That is why this quarter you saw us announce two transactions, one to drive greater sustainability of GEP business over the long-term and one to expand the vaccines portfolio.","Hospira is an excellent strategic fit in attractive and growing market segment including sterile injectables and biosimilars and we expect the acquisition to accelerate the growth trajectory to GEP business. We remain on track for a closing in the second half of this year. And our deal for Redvax expands our vaccine development portfolio by giving us access to a promising vaccine in preclinical development of human cytomegalovirus, a virus that can lead to serious disabilities in infants when passed from newly infected mothers to their new borns.","We now have a broader marketed vaccine portfolio for preventing serious illnesses, which includes the most widely used conjugate vaccine in the world, Prevenar 13 with more than 750 million doses distributed. Remember recently approved to prevent invasive disease caused by group B meningitis in people age 10 to 25 and vaccines to protect against disease caused by group C meningitis and to help prevent tick-borne encephalitis through acquiring Baxter International\u2019s market in vaccines.","As you\u2019ve heard us say on several occasions, business development is not a strategy, it is one lever of several we have available for strengthening our two basic businesses, innovative product business and established products business.","This year\u2019s off to a good start with momentum in the pipeline growing, market penetration for our newest in line products and strategic additions to the portfolio. Our focus for the year will continue to be on supporting our recent new product launches, in particular Ibrance and Prevenar 13 adult, accelerating and differentiating key programs in the pipeline to deliver breakthrough products, continuing to look for attractive business development opportunities that strengthen our businesses, and doing all of these things while we deploy our capital in a way that yields the greatest value to shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Frank.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thanks Ian, good day everyone. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast. First quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $10.9 billion and reflect operational growth of $250 million or 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by the strong performance of Prevenar 13 and Eliquis in developed markets and Lyrica, Nexium 24HR, Xeljanz and Viagra primarily in the U.S. The launch of Ibrance in the U.S. is February of this year and 12% operational growth in emerging markets which were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $739 million or 7%, the loss of exclusivity in immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December of 2014, other product losses of exclusivity and the termination of the Spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 versus $0.57 in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact due to the 295 million upfront payment to OPKO, during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 148 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to ongoing share repurchases which includes the partial-quarter impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement effective February 2015. Reported diluted EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.36 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower legal charges which were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by $739 million or $0.07 and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $462 million or 7%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year ago quarter.","Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the first quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 7% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the U.S. and Japan and the performance from recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. ","Although operationally revenues increased 7% and cost of sales decreased 1%, income before taxes declined 9% operationally mainly because of a 59% operational increase in R&D expenses primarily due to the previously mentioned upfront payment to OPKO Health and to a lesser extent, an 11% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investments in new products and certain in-line brands.","First quarter VOC revenues increased 29% operationally due to the 51% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of Prevenar 13 which grew 80% in the U.S. and 15% internationally and the inclusion of Baxter\u2019s market of vaccines in Europe, Nexium 24HR in the U.S., the launch of Ibrance in the U.S. in February and Xalkori and Inlyta globally.","Income before taxes increased 41% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in gross margin, partially offset by a 19% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in Prevenar 13 adult indication, Nexium 24HR and the Trumenba and Ibrance launches, and the 7% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased investment in the Ibrance development program and the global immuno-oncology alliance with Merck KGaA and other oncology products.","In the first quarter Global Established Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 10% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December of 2014 and to a lesser extent from the loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in certain developed markets in Europe during the first quarter of 2015 and Zyvox IV in the U.S. in January 2015, continued generic competition for Lipitor in developed markets and determination of the Spiriva co-promotion agreement in most countries including in U.S. in April of 2014. All of these were partially offset by strong operational growth of 10% in emerging markets, driven by Lipitor; Viagra and Norvasc.","Income before taxes declined 14% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and 1% operational increase or 2.1 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues and cost of sales due to an unfavorable change in product mix. Flatter R&D expenses primarily due to increased spending in our biosimilars development programs offset by lower clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by 9% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives.","Now, I would like to walk you through the updated full year 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. I want to point out that there are no unfavorable changes to our operational outlook; we\u2019re only updating the 2015guidance ranges for these elements solely due to the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar from mid-January to mid-April, primarily driven by the weakening of the euro.","This updated guidance assumes an FX rate for the euro of approximately $1.06. As a result, we are lowering our reported revenue range by $500 million and now expect the range to be $44 billion to $46 billion. It\u2019s important to note that the actual negative impact of foreign exchange in our full year 2015 revenues is actually greater than $500 million. However, the operational strength of our revenues is allowing us to absorb this.","In addition, we are lowering our reported and adjusted diluted EPS ranges by $0.05 and now expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.47 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05. Before moving, I want to point out that actual rates in mid-April 2015 do not include the impact of a potential devaluation of the Venezuela and Boulevard.","We\u2019re reaffirming the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance which we issued on January 27, 2015.","Moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid financial performance in the first quarter. While we have no one favorable changes in our operational outlook for the remainder of 2015, we have updated our financial guidance solely to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates. We entered into an agreement to acquire Hospira for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. Subject to the appropriate regulatory approvals, we continue to expect to complete transaction in the second half of 2015.","We achieved several key R&D milestones so far in 2015 including receiving accelerated approval from the FDA for Ibrance with letrozole for first line advanced breast cancer, our Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study for Ibrance with fulvestrant met its primary efficacy end point, the FDA lifting the partial clinical hold on our tanezumab development program and we\u2019re preparing to resume Phase 3 activities with our partner Eli Lilly and the EC approved an expanded indication for the use of Prevenar 13 adults aged 18 years and older.","We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation; in the first quarter of 2015 we\u2019ve returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. It\u2019s important to note that after repurchasing $6 billion of our common stock, the first quarter 2015 including our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase, we have already met our 2015 share repurchase target and do not currently expect to repurchase additional shares this year. We continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","I will use my question please to ask about use of capital, if I may. I know it\u2019s something you\u2019ve discussed a lot but I think we\u2019re always interested in even subtle changes in how you answer these questions. But Ian, I was just wondering, when you think about use of capital, are you at this point, I think in the past you remarked that if the numbers make sense, you would be open to a large deal similar to the AstraZeneca proposal last year; just wanted to take your temperature on that. And then also would you in theory be interested in buying a company that in adding small molecule and DA capabilities to the established products business or do you feel that the acquisition of Hospira kind of filled the gaps that -- the main gaps that that business may have had? And finally as you look across the landscape in biotech, do you have general thoughts on biotech valuations and opportunities there? Thank you.","Ian Read","I think the organization is agnostic to the size of BD; it has to be BD that will move the needle. And I\u2019m not concerned about doing a large transaction if the value was there for shareholders, vis-\u00e0-vis between adding to Innovative or adding to GEP adding to Consumer, we\u2019re driven by value; does it create value for shareholders; we have the capacity to add businesses in any one of those areas. And the last part of the question was I think valuation; I think I said last quarter, I thought that the valuation of biotech was bland; I still believe it remains there. So, it means we\u2019re very careful as we evaluate deals we -- there\u2019s probably no deal that actually occurs that we haven\u2019t looked at and evaluated, but we have a strong focus on creating shareholder value and that\u2019s what guides us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you very much. Ian, in your prepared remarks you failed to mention tax conversions. I\u2019m just curious to know how much of a priority a tax conversion still is or unlocking the value of your overseas cash flows. And if you were to abide by the current IRS laws today, doesn\u2019t that mean that there are fewer large targets available to you than before; can you confirm that and really just your appetite? And then secondly, you\u2019ve said before that the earliest you can break up the company is in 2017; I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s day one 2017 because we will at that point have three full years of financials. And if that\u2019s correct, are you targeting a decision sometime next year, I would think that once you make the decision, it\u2019s going to take about a year or so before you actually execute on the split or maybe it won\u2019t take quite that long but are you targeting a decision next year and if so what at this point are you waiting for to make that decision?","Ian Read","Well, taking the first question -- the last question first, I believe what we said is that we would be in a position to -- if we so took the decision, to effectuate or start the split in \u201817 which probably means we\u2019d have to take a decision in latter part of \u201816. We do need three years of financials; we will get those three years of financials by the end of \u201816. And what are we waiting for, as we said before Jami, I want to see how these two divisions operating inside of Pfizer, are they on their own sustainable businesses. So I\u2019m waiting to see our pipeline develop; I\u2019m waiting to add as we have done with Hospira, more attractive assets into established products and then I\u2019m also looking to see how does the street value the Pfizer as it is today does and what -- and we\u2019ve given you a lot of information on our segments; so is the sum of the parts different from the whole and we will make that decision around that latter part of \u201816. So I think that answers that question.","We are as always focused in our decision making on creating shareholder value. And I think those three elements I laid out to you would describe how we would judge whether any such action will create shareholder value.","On the issue of lowering our tax rate or re-domiciling, tax is one of our largest expenses. We, as any management should be, are focused on trying to prudently manage our expenses. The new proposed rule change does make it more difficult to immediately realize any benefits from being re-domiciled but it really depends upon the target, very complex issues of where the assets and where the cash and the tax position of the target. And so really it\u2019s very, very different for say what the universe of possible targets are but rest assured then when we look at those type of BD deals, we\u2019re looking at the creation of value.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So, with respect to the potential separation of the businesses, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re not willing to disclose the relative cash flow of the two segments. But my assumption is that the cash flow of the Innovative business is an even smaller percentage of the total company cash flow than the earnings that you disclosed from the Innovative business would suggest. So anyway Frank, I was just hoping that you could speak to that and help us understand whether that\u2019s accurate and whether the lack of cash flow in the innovative business is something that could potentially constrain your ability to separate or monetize that business.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So, a couple of comments, David. Let me just start by saying, reminding everyone this quarter when we file our 10-Q, we\u2019ll be including balance sheet information for this segment but we won\u2019t have debt or cash for example by segment; we\u2019ll have on the asset side accounts receivable, inventory, tax assets and other assets and then on liability side we\u2019ll have on accounts payable accrued compensation and other liability. So, we\u2019ll start providing balance sheet information but we won\u2019t be providing debt or cash by various segments, since those are really enterprise assets, enterprise liabilities at this point.","What I would say is this that I don\u2019t see capital structure. So, I\u2019m going to raise it up a little bit. You asked about cash but I\u2019ll answer the question by saying, I don\u2019t see capital structure and somehow impeding our decision making. So, let\u2019s hit to whether or not to execute a split of the company. We believe, I believe we can clearly manage our way through capital structure, so that\u2019s not in any way, shape or form some sort of impeding factor relative to our decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Just a few here, first on Ibrance; can you just discuss a little bit more about the launch and commercial plans from here for the asset? And as part of that, can you just give us a little bit of color on the importance of PALOMA-3 for the market opportunity and the ramp of the product; and how big of an opportunity does this open up for Pfizer? My second question was coming back to GEP. Do you have the capacity to pursuing the large deal here or are you primarily focused on Hospira integration at this point, not so much financial capacity but just you have -- but personnel in place of another big deal where available could you pursue it?","Ian Read","So, let me just talk about the deal. We\u2019ve done several large integrations. We\u2019re working well with Hospira. We expected to close in the second half of this year. Should value be there, this organization has a capability of undertaking our deals independent of size, if it was important for our shareholder. So, I\u2019m not concerned about that. I would pass it over to Albert to talk about Ibrance.","Albert Bourla","Overall, we are very pleased with the results. And so far Ibrance is being well received by oncologists. We have over 800 healthcare practitioners prescribing it. We have over 2000 patients in one quarter and we have approximately 3000 total scripts written so far. First line market share is already approaching 10% that\u2019s way ahead of previous analogues. And also we see strong reinvestment so far. Now expectation is that Ibrance will gradually grow to become a new standard of care, a first line treatment of this group of patients. But over time momentum in breast cancer will build beyond first line as other studies read out positive. For example, you mentioned the results of PALOMA-3 which will be presented at ASCO but we plan to work with the FDA to expand the label to other lines of therapy based on these results. And also as a reminder, there are several other breast cancer studies running in early and recurrence settings.","And needless to say but also we have many non-breast tumor studies including head and neck, lung, melanoma et cetera. Now for your particular importance of PALOMA-3, as I said, so far there is limited medical use in second and third line given that the label is in first line. So as I said, we will work with FDA to expand the label to other lines of therapy. But beyond label amendment, I think we should see the PALOMA-3 in the way that adds to the level of confidence in the mechanics of action and of course is also confirmation of an additional effective Ibrance combination, but this time with Faslodex, before we had with flat fulvestrant. [Ph]","Ian Read","And we are at Pfizer and very focused on speed and maximizing the opportunity of Ibrance and getting this great product to patients as fast as possible. And I believe we will be filing in the EU in the second half of this year. Is that right?","Albert Bourla","This is correct, Ian.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Tim Anderson","Enbrel was down 8% operationally in Europe; I am wondering how much of this reflects the impact of biosimilar Remicade and if you can talk about expectations for that product going forward in Europe, both in terms of volume growth and pricing. And then going back to this topic of splitting up, looking to see if you could give us odds of the possibility that Pfizer chooses not to split up, you consistently leave that open as a possibility for the last several years that we\u2019ve talked about this topic. And as I am sure you\u2019re aware, most investors want you to do something beyond just buying more targets and getting bigger. So it would be helpful to know with odds of that hope not being delivered on our -- is it less than 10%, less than 20%, less than 50% or what exactly?","Ian Read","Let me try and deal with split before we ask Geno to deal with Enbrel. What I would say Tim is that I think this management team has established a reputation of focusing its actions on shareholder value. So, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s useful to give odds; what I think is useful is to say we will do what\u2019s best for shareholders in creating value for them. And some of our transactions, when we were looking at previous once last year, at times we talked about getting bigger to get smaller. Because by getting bigger, we could add and strengthen the independent businesses and then get smaller if it made sense.","Frankly, we\u2019re focused on creating value for shareholders. And if a split or getting bigger and then splitting make sense, we will execute that because the prime driver of this management team is to create shareholder value.","With that I\u2019ll pass it over to Geno to talk about Enbrel in Europe.","Geno Germano","Tim, the situation in Europe with Enbrel was that we implanted a new distribution model in the UK. We started at the end of last year where we moved away from the retail channel into just the hospital channel and directed patients. So, we saw in the first quarter this year was some inventory work down in the first quarter and that affected our sales in the UK.","We had good strong sales in Italy and France and Spain. So, we really didn\u2019t see anything more widespread than the distribution change. In terms of effective biosimilar Remicade on the Enbrel business, we really haven\u2019t seen an impact there either. So, we\u2019re expecting to see continued modest growth to very large base of business; it\u2019s a very well accepted product throughout Europe and the rest of the world. And we anticipate continuation of modest growth for the brand outside the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","First Frank, just mechanistically, how would a very large transaction if you did one affect the timing of a potential split? Clearly the Hospira deal did not affect your timeline but I imagine certain deals could. And secondly for John; it\u2019s good to see another strong quarter from Hospira. Is it fair to say that the addition of Hospira in your mind takes gap from flat to declining in sales in the out years to pretty squarely into growth territory? Thanks.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Just to reiterate what I said before and then I\u2019ll answer the question specifically. We\u2019re doing all the things we need to do, in particular the three years of prospective audited financials, so that we\u2019d be in a position to exercise our option in 2017, if we chose to do so. And as I said before, the Hospira acquisition does not impact that timeline. But then Gregg, specific to your question, if we were to do a large transaction, and as Ian said before, we\u2019re agnostic to size, it\u2019s really all about we believe we create shareholder value for our shareholders, it could, it clearly could impact our timeline. If we were to do a transaction and if it were to impact our timeline, please know we\u2019ll proactively tell you all that as soon as we know.","John Young","So, first of all, just to reiterate, as you know, we obviously don\u2019t provide guidance by individual business. But obviously we\u2019re very pleased to see the continued positive strong momentum for the Hospira business this quarter. The GEP business has been subject to some LOEs which I think Ian mentioned in his script and as we\u2019ve -- it applies. We knew that in the short-term that will therefore impact the revenue trajectory of the base GEP business over the next year or two. But overall, the transaction certainly represents an immediate incremental source of revenue growth with products that can be expanded into additional markets, given Pfizer\u2019s global reach. And I think the excitement that I think we\u2019ve seen in the financial community that certainly we share really is around the transaction bringing together two excellent businesses that will deliver not only near-term profitable revenue growth but also provide a platform for future growth that can be enhanced through Pfizer\u2019s global reach and infrastructure. So, we remain very positive about the combination of the two businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John Boris","First one just has to do with the Hospira transaction. Can you give any clarity on when you might anticipate HSR clearance? Most notably one thing that we noticed was that on medium and broad spectrum, antibiotics and beta-lactams that there\u2019s some overlap and then certainly the overlap in the biosimilars, so any kind of commentary on product divestitures would be helpful. And then second question on your oncology business, if you look at Xalkori, you have number one, number two competitors in oncology launching all positive compounds globally; Inlyta, in light of I\/O data that potentially is becoming available, can you maybe discuss the OS benefit Inlyta has potentially to being able to compete with I\/O? And then on Ibrance just potentially competitive threat since competitors are indicating that could have data in the \u201816 to Ibrance, just your thoughts on your competitive positioning of that franchise going forward here.","Ian Read","Okay John, thank you, some very optimistic questions there. Why don\u2019t we deal first of all with Hospira; Doug can you do that?","Doug Lankler","Sure. So, we\u2019re looking at all the aspects relative, beyond obviously biosimilars as well, we\u2019re working closely with regulators and we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the second half of 2015.","Ian Read","And on the oncology issues, would you like to comment upon what we expect the competition launching and then our second generation or third generation ALK\/ROS and then perhaps Mikael may want to comment on some of the competitive dynamics.","Geno Germano","Absolutely and thanks John for the question. In Ibrance, I spoke a little bit before; and right now we are really the only company that has randomized data out there, so we can make any comparison. We have the most advanced and the most broad program in CDK 4\/6. I say more advanced because we are the only one, so that we have registration to start with and we have already announced positive results of a second study in a different population and of course we are having already initiated, right now we have in this year running already four Phase 3 studies on the breast cancer. And we\u2019re running beyond breast cancer over 30 studies in multiple tumor indications. So I have a lot of respect for competitors but I think in that one really we are way ahead.","Ian Read","I think one competitor just demand that they may be finishing their Phase 3 in \u201817, is that right?","Geno Germano","In \u201816, second half of \u201816, yes. What we expect -- we have already registrations and for the same type, we expect the confirmatory study to come to completion at last the quarter this year in August. And as Ian said before also, we have discussions with EU authorities and we plan to file for Ibrance in the second half of this year as well.","Ian Read","Mikael, any comments?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, I want to just briefly comment on your discussion about our ALK franchise. I think we should look up on it as an ALK franchise, where Xalkori is most experienced drug with a very much recognized stable profile. We shared at recent conferences including presentation at AACR our third generation ALK inhibitor with 3922 number name. And it\u2019s really unique compound that hits all known ALK mutations including the G1202R. And to the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s still only compound so far that have shown strong effect across all mutation independent whether the patient has experienced several of the currently available ALK inhibitors. Moreover, several responses also against brain metastases have been reported for this drug. So, I think the combined ALK franchise from place that will over time be very strong.","Inlyta can nicely also be combined with a immune-oncology product as per our strategy. So, we shouldn\u2019t see Inlyta as alone facing other entrants but we and Merck Serono are exploring immune-oncology avelumab, Inlyta and other agents. So, I think you will see us building a strong position in renal cell carcinoma.","Ian Read","And John, I sort of see the competition coming in and extending the survival time of patients with the ALK mutation s very positive for our third generation when it comes to market. As you\u2019ll have of all patients that have gone through our first line as Xalkori increases second line on products of competitors and creating a more substantial patient base for our third generation ALK. So thanks for the questions.","Operator","Next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","I got two quick ones on the product side and one of the expense side. So just on to products, just if you can kind of give us a sense of your optimism on tanezumab at this point. I know you\u2019re talking about the Phase 3 now. But just given the kind of safety issues that have been before, do you see that\u2019s potentially a blockbuster to products or is it more of a niche product just given some of the safety questions. Lipitor, quick question on the real world study there, I know it\u2019s completed, has been completed over some time; any update on when we might see the data there? And then just on the last on the expense side, if I read the release correctly, you had quite a bit of expenses allocated to the other bucket as opposed to being allocated to one of the three specific business units? In other words are five quarters in to the company operating as three separate units; how should we think about in terms of your ability to actually split into two entities if we want to without having significant amount of dis-synergies as given there is some -- there will be a lot of overlap in how the expenses are being expected?","Ian Read","Geno, tanezumab?","Geno Germano","Tanezumab, look, we see this as a real innovation; one of the first real breakthroughs in pain management in many, many years and a significant unmet need over use of opioids being a big problem and a substantial number of patients with the conditions that we\u2019re pursuing osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. So we see that this drug has significant potential. We know a lot about this medicine; we\u2019ve completed quite a number of studies and we\u2019re anxious to see it advance through this next phase of development and enter the market.","Ian Read","Albert, real world, real life study Lipitor?","Albert Bourla","The actual use trial was completed in December. So the results are expected this quarter. The results of study will inform next steps and timelines for potential NDA filing. And we will continue to update you as we have more news on that.","Ian Read","And Frank on expenses?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","The major items in that other bucket are WRD. So, Mikael\u2019s organization and I\u2019ll call it corporate. We think about corporate as what we call the enabling function. So, it\u2019s IT; finance; legal; HR; facilities; public relations, all those functions basically are what are in our corporate bucket there. Last year in the Q, we gave you all percentages on how to allocate those various items to the segments. The key there is in terms of the basis of what\u2019s underpinning those percentages that we gave you. There is really three buckets of allocations there; I\u2019ll call it specific assignments, regional allocations and general allocations.","The specific assignments are about 40%; the regional allocations are about 20%; the general allocations are about 40%. So, we provide all that details, so that you can basically drive it to segment. And what that tells you is much of it, the specific assignment and the regional allocation is very specific to an individual segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez","Just a few quick questions, couple on the pipeline and then one for Ian. On the pipeline, maybe just to start off, maybe we could talk a little bit about when we might see data with your 4-1BB and what combinations we may see. Interestingly, we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on AstraZeneca\u2019s deal with Celgene and their comments on the challenges of getting into hem tumors. The second question, just given the broad success of Opdivo in second line lung cancer, when and how do you see your recently announced study recruiting in the U.S. or perhaps even in Europe over the next 12 months as approvals are likely received?","And then lastly for Ian, when you say that you are agnostic to the creation of shareholder value, I think everybody has asked the question of the possibility that you go out and buy more assets. However, I do think that there certainly is the possibility of lowering your tax rates with the willingness to perhaps merge with an overseas entity with that entity being the controlling entity. How agnostic are you truly to that kind of an outcome?","Ian Read","I\u2019ll ask Mikael to comment on the 4-1BB. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s appropriate first to comment on AZ strategy and how they go about financing their pipeline. And then on lung cancer perhaps Mikael or Albert can deal with that. Then I\u2019ll come back to on how agnostic I feel.","Mikael Dolsten","As you know, we believe that the field of I\/O combinations is going to increasingly be prominent. And we have invested in a broad number of I\/O combinations; we\u2019ll have up to five I\/O drugs in the clinic this year and expect every year probably, two new entering. Specifically for 4-1BB, we will share additional data at ASCO. We have growing experience with 4-1BB in lymphoma on rituximab background that said yes the stable activity and good volatility profile. And I think suggest that this class of combining check point activators with check point inhibitors may be the route to go as we have learned combining multiple check point inhibitors as CTLA-4 and PD-1, mainly to decreasing therapeutic window while 4-1BB we\u2019re very encouraged that the therapeutic window will be large and the drug is an interesting part of this new I\/O combination.","I also wanted to make a pitch that we actually are now entering the clinic with our OX40 antibody that also will be planned to explode as mono-therapy and later in combination with avelumab. Briefly just on second line lung cancer, as we announced avelumab into several solid tumor indications, we expect over the years of \u201817, \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820 to see multiple pivotal trials readout and opportunities for drug registrations across several of the solid tumors including lung cancer.","Ian Read","Thank you Mikael. Now Seamus, I think you mentioned; I think you perhaps misquoted me there. I\u2019m not agnostic on value; I\u2019m agnostic on size and I\u2019m totally focused on value. And I think it\u2019s sort of alluding your questions about the -- whether you\u2019re 80-20 or 60-40 to maximize your benefits. And once again I\u2019m open to any sort of combinations that when we look at it, produces clear value for our shareholders. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","I have a couple. First for Frank, isn\u2019t the full year share count guidance 6.2 billion shares versus Q1\u2019s nearly 6.3 billion; that difference is 3.2 billion in share repurchase? And related to that, I\u2019m surprised the share count was not much lower in Q1 versus Q4, given the 150 million share repurchase. I guess the answer might be that you weren\u2019t expecting the stock to be so strong but maybe you can clarify. And then secondly how much of the 300 million in Prevenar sales in adults in Q1 would you consider catch up versus the cohort of people that just turned 65 and are receptive to vaccination?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So on the share repurchase Steve, our projection for the end of the year is a little bit higher than the number you quoted and we obviously factored that into our guidance. And then in terms of the shares from Q4 to Q1, remember on that accelerated share repurchase, we got a partial quarter benefit for that in the number, because we didn\u2019t put that in place until February, so kind of think about it as a mid quarter impact. But if you go to the full year, we\u2019re a little bit higher than the 6.2 and what\u2019s really been driving that and it\u2019s a good issue is, stock price is higher than we thought it was going to be. From a share repurchase assumption perspective, in terms of what we assumed in our planning, it\u2019s higher than what we had planned for, but net-net it\u2019s all factored into our guidance.","Ian Read","Al, if you\u2019d like to sort of try and dissect it, interesting market for adult vaccines in the U.S. and potentially internationally.","Albert Bourla","I don\u2019t have specific data yet as to how much is catch up or not but it\u2019s an indication of, the 300 is an indication of the significant potential of this market. Let me run some numbers for you. Every year 4 million adults in U.S. alone are turning 65. There are 27 million adults that have been previously vaccinated with PPV 23 and additional 20 million adults that have never been vaccinated, that\u2019s a pool of 47 million adults in U.S. Both of these cohorts are now recommended and reimbursed to receive Prevenar 13. And the same comes with Europe. In Europe, we have already received the label, the prevention of pneumonia for adults 18 and older. We are working country by country to ensure recommendations and after that reimbursement which will take some time but typically it\u2019s happening. And in general, we are very pleased with the first quarter, the results. They were driven of course by the broad recommendation. We had the severe flu season that also played a role and also our commercial efforts were very successful. Going forward in the spring months, we expect the revenues to moderate given the seasonality of the business but we expect strong revenue growth will resume in the fall. And overall we expect very strong growth for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","A question on your immune-oncology portfolio; do you have any evidence to date to conclude that the ADC enabled properties of your PDL-1 are positively significantly differentiated versus the other non-factor enabled PDL 1s that aren\u2019t clinically approved. Second, is it still the case that you haven\u2019t shared any solid tumor responses with your anti-CD-137 or is that changed? And then lastly, perhaps you could comment on the strategic outlook of your consumer health business, given it\u2019s a very active market out there with numerous potential buyers who I\u2019m sure would be interested in your assets?","Ian Read","Mikael, could you take us through the immune-oncology questions?","Mikael Dolsten","I think you asked briefly about ADCs and then mainly around differentiation for our immune-oncology assets. Maybe I\u2019d just say a few words on ADCs. We have built up seven ADCs in the clinic. You\u2019 heard recently about our clindamycin ADC, inotuzumab showing positive and good data for the first of two primary end points, hematological remissions. We have next wave in Phase 1\/2 studies; I can particular mention one that you think you should keep an eye on that we will also believe will continue to established ADC as an important modality. And we are indeed quite encouraged by the idea of combining the selectivity of ADCs with immune-oncology. So I think your question was really good by asking about those modalities.","Our PDL-1, as you know, our view is that data available to-date suggests that it will have a similar profile to that on other advance PD-1 and PDL-1 antibodies that are presented data in unselected patient. And as you continue to explore enrichment of patients such as increase level of PDL-1, it\u2019s expected that response rate will further increase as well as with a drug combination. There\u2019s been some suggestion as from a reported ASR that avelumab may also on the positive end pick up some ADCs to rank itself; it remains to be proven what tumor types this could potentially be a differentiation. But so far we have said that avelumab has a competitive profile similar to the PD-1, PDL-1 and we are very excited to advance the molecule and we\u2019ll share an update at ASCO.","Ian Read","And on the Consumer business, it actually had a very quarter, very good growth. And so it\u2019s a business that we like to be in. I think it\u2019s a strategically important business for us. And we will continue to develop it and if we have opportunities to do acquisitions to grow, we\u2019ll also look at those. So it\u2019s a good business to be in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin Bristow","Couple of quick questions, on the biosimilar Avastin; what\u2019s your view with regards to what agencies were required for approval? Do you think response rates will be sufficient, would you anticipate meeting survival data? And also do you see any issues with recruitment here, given there is question of more incentives to trial the biosimilar versus the innovator? And then last question on Xeljanz; I see you\u2019re filing based on 5 and 10 milligrams data in plaque psoriasis; is that potential for this data set to assist any approval of the 10 milligram data in RA?","Ian Read","Biosimilar, Avastin, Mikael comments on that?","Mikael Dolsten","I would say that for each of the biosimilars, we negotiate end point with the regulatory agencies. And we expect that data that indicate you have equivalence analytical on the drug pharmacokinetics and clinical profile in general will lead to registration across multiple indications. I can\u2019t specifically speculate on what would be required for Avastin but I will in general be optimistic that readout such as response rates or PFS will be likely confirm by equivalence if you do have also strong robust data on the other aspect by equivalence. We have now five antibodies working closely with GEP in the pipeline and we are very pleased so far with all of those; four are in Phase 3 studies. ","Geno Germano","On the 10 milligram data in psoriasis; as you know the psoriasis patient population is a much different patient population then RA. However, as we accumulate more and more data on the 10 milligram in both in RA post marketing surveillance studies in the additional indications including psoriasis and ulcerative colitis and other indications, the data base continues to grow. And that will serve as our support for continuing to evaluate the 10 milligram across all of the indications as time goes by.","Operator","Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","A follow-up on biosimilars on your outlook; could you comment on some of the intellectual property barriers that you might face in bringing biosimilars to the market and specifically I am wondering about the Humira biosimilars that you have in development. What\u2019s your expected time line for that product given some of the IP that AbbVie [ph] keeps referring to?","John Young","I think what we\u2019d say is obviously we\u2019re looking at full range of considerations when we develop our portfolio of biosimilars. As Mikael just said and answered to the previous question, we engage very strongly with the regulators to make sure that have an appropriate clinical program and clearly we\u2019re very mindful of the IP landscape which frankly varies by asset, is very complex ranging from base patents to a range of other patents.","So we work very closely with our legal team to assess the likely time of entry to the marketplace for all of our biosimilars and we take that into full consideration when we\u2019re constructing our development program and making our forecast for the long range.","Chuck Triano","Thanks John.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, as well as our 2017 guidance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Fourth Quarter 2016, which is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1A, Risk Factors, that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at SEC.gov and on our website at Pfizer.com.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will make a few comments about the year and where we see the opportunities for continued growth in 2017. Frank will provide details regarding the quarter and our 2017 financial guidance.","2016 was marked by solid execution, which led to another year of operational revenue growth, both in terms of our overall portfolio, which showed an increase of 11% for the year, and on a Pfizer standalone basis excluding legacy Hospira and Medivation, where the annual growth was 5%. We saw robust revenue growth from both new and mature brands.","Pfizer Essential Health established market-leading positions in sterile injectables and biosimilars. Our sterile injectables portfolio achieved over $6 billion in revenue during the year, and in our biosimilars business we launched Inflectra, the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody available in the U.S. Globally, we had three marketed biosimilars and are the leader in total sales, as well as having a robust pipeline of biosimilar assets. We look to the sterile injectables and biosimilar portfolios to continue to generate growth for the Essential Health business and also expect continued growth of the Essential Health portfolio in emerging markets, which achieved 7% operational growth in 2016.","For Pfizer Innovative Health, Eliquis achieved 88% operational growth for the year and is the number one prescribed new oral anticoagulant by cardiologists in 12 markets around the globe. Xeljanz grew 78% operationally and is now nearly a $1 billion brand on an annual revenue basis. Chantix grew 27% operationally. In December, the FDA approved updates to Chantix's labeling, including the removal of the boxed warning regarding serious neuropsychiatric events based on the outcomes of the EAGLES study. Lyrica grew 14% operationally, and our consumer healthcare business achieved another year of solid performance with 5% operational growth. Ibrance remains a significant growth driver. Its revenue almost tripled year over year and grew 17% globally on a sequential quarterly basis, reflecting its attractive clinical profile and continued acceptance by physicians, payers, and patients. Ibrance received EU approval in November and will begin to launch across Europe during the year, resulting in incremental revenues, primarily in the second half of the year. We feel very confident about our leadership in the CDK 4\/6 inhibitor class.","Our business development activities during 2016 have provided us with attractive revenue growth opportunities within both of our businesses. With the acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor to our Innovative business, we have added Xtandi for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and Eucrisa for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children as young as 2 years of age. And the addition of AstraZeneca's small molecule anti-infective business to Essential Health has strengthened our anti-infectives portfolio, which is the industry's largest, with more than 60 products.","Each of these acquisitions strategically aligns with our approach to business development, which is to look for opportunities that contribute immediate and\/or near-term revenue growth. As we look at the total company operational revenue growth profile, we see our current in-market products, including our recently acquired products, as having the ability to deliver an enhanced revenue growth rate over time and more than offsetting continued headwinds from product losses of exclusivity.","In 2017, on an operational basis, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects 4% revenue growth, excluding the Hospira Infusion Systems business, which we expect to divest next month. Improved revenue growth is an important driver of valuation and requires continued solid executions in addition to the ongoing advancement of our key pipeline assets. In 2016, we received five product approvals, achieved six regulatory submissions, and advanced 39 compounds in our pipeline. Our current pipeline contains 96 clinical programs \u2013 half biologics, half small molecules \u2013 and about two-thirds new molecular entities, and is well-positioned. And in 2017, we're expecting pivotal top line study results in oncology and biosimilars.","A few pipeline highlights include: In oncology, we a very robust life-cycle program for Ibrance. It is being studied in an additional four pivotal studies in early, advanced, or recurrent breast cancer. In addition, Ibrance is being studied in several non-breast cancer indications, including two sponsored trials in pancreatic and head and neck cancers. Xtandi has provided us with a novel treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. We see a potential opportunity to extend the type of androgen receptor blocker in Xtandi into other indications and to seek regulatory approval in non-metastatic prostate cancer.","In immuno-oncology, we're making significant progress in building a strong I-O portfolio and see avelumab as a core asset. Through our partner, Merck KGaA, in the U.S. the avelumab submission for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma was accepted by the FDA with priority review. And we also have announced that the European Medicines Agency validated for review the marketing authorization application in the EU. We have 11 compounds in the clinic, including anti-PD-1 MAb, a T-cell retargeting P-cadherin T-DART (9:32), a small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, and the allogeneic UCART19 T-cell therapy for pediatric and adult acute lymphomic leukemia. Our avelumab program with Merck KGaA now has 30 programs ongoing, 10 of which are potentially registration enabling. And over 4,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies.","The breadth of our I-O portfolio allows us to differentiate with combinations, which is core to our strategy. For example, we are starting to deliver data with avelumab and 4-1BB. We plan to initiate by the end of the first quarter a triplet with avelumab, 4-1BB, and OX40. And we'll have studies with avelumab combined with rituximab and 4-1BB. We also have studies with avelumab with lorlatinib, our next-generation ALK inhibitor, and avelumab with Inlyta.","In biosimilars, we recently announced positive top line results for both infliximab, a potential biosimilar to Remicade, and trastuzumab, a potential biosimilar for Herceptin. And this month we announced positive top line results from the comparator REFLECTIONS study for adalimumab, a potential biosimilar to Humira. This marked the third potential biosimilar molecule from our pipeline to report positive top line data results during the past four months. This year, we expect readouts in bavituximab and filgrastim, and we have a total of 14 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development.","In inflammation and immunology, we have one of the strongest JAK franchises in the industry and have advanced four immunokinases, including three selective JAK and one IRAK4 inhibitor to clinical two studies. Our Phase 2 trials cover 10 different indications, from rheumatoid arthritis to gastrointestinal to dermatology.","And in vaccines we have a robust portfolio that continues to progress. We achieved proof of concept of our C. difficile vaccine and expect to enter Phase 3 in the coming months. Our staph aureus vaccine is currently in Phase 2, and we now have a novel pneumococcal vaccine in the clinic in Phase 1 that could potentially cover up to 20 serotypes.","Of note, during 2017 we anticipate potential U.S. decisions for our avelumab Merkel cell carcinoma, potential lorlatinib submission for non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for additional indications for Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis and geriatric arthritis.","As we look at the year ahead, Pfizer's well-positioned with our in-market portfolio and our pipeline assets. I also see our company's structure, with its two distinct businesses, as affording us the focus and sense of urgency to deliver enhanced revenue growth over time. For 2017, we look forward to working with a new administration and across the healthcare system. Our efforts will continue to be focused on developing, delivering, and providing access to innovative therapies that address areas of unmet medical need and that advance patient care. Pfizer has long held a contract with society through our business practices and culture to ensure that patients get the medicines they need.","In summary, in 2016, we created significant value for our shareholders through several initiatives, including acquisitions and partnerships that bolstered each of our businesses, share repurchases, and an increase to the dividend. We enter 2017 with strong financial position, products that are leaders in their categories, strong and emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline, and an operational structure that gives us the flexibility to differentiate our business in ways that will continue to create shareholder value.","Now I turn it over to Frank to provide more detail on the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast.","As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the full year 2016 reflect legacy Hospira global operations for the entire period, while full year 2015 includes only four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. Our financial results for the fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 include legacy full Hospira global operations for both periods. In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include three months and approximately six months of legacy Anacor operations, respectively, which were immaterial. Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include three months of legacy Medivation operations.","Now moving on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2016 revenues were approximately $13.6 billion and reflect a year-over-year operational decline of $191 million or 1%. It's important to note that fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the U.S. and three fewer international selling days versus the prior-year quarter, which unfavorably affected revenues by approximately $750 million. If you'll recall, in the first quarter of 2016 I pointed out that there were nine more selling days versus the prior-year quarter and that this imbalance would be primarily offset in the fourth quarter 2016, which would have seven fewer selling days. It's important to note that there are essentially the same number of selling days in full year 2016 as in full year 2015, so they impacted the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably the first and fourth quarters.","Fourth quarter 2016 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $228 million or 2%. Our Innovative Health business recorded 2% operational revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally, Xtandi in the U.S. with the Medivation acquisition in September, and in Xeljanz and Lyrica, both in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by a 23% operational decrease in global Prevnar 13 revenues. In the U.S., Prevnar 13 declined 33% due to a decrease in revenues for the adult indication after the high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth quarter of 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining catch-up opportunity compared to the prior-year quarter and the unfavorable impact from the timing of government purchases to the pediatric indication.","We continue to believe that Prevnar 13, both pediatric and adult indications, will remain very significant products for Pfizer, notwithstanding this decrease in the fourth quarter 2016 and the expectation that full year 2017 global Prevnar 13 revenues will remain flat to slightly down. We do expect Prevnar adult launches in international markets, as well as the potential for increased utilization in the 18 to 64 population to temper. We expect a decline in sales in the U.S.","Fourth quarter Innovative Health revenues were also negatively impacted by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition and the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S.","Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased 6% operationally, driven by a 20% operational decline from Peri-LOE products and a 3% operational decline from legacy established products, which were partially offset by operational growth of 3% from the sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio and 48% in biosimilars. Revenues from legacy Hospira products declined 1% operationally; however, excluding the performance of Hospira Infusion Systems, these revenues actually increased 2% operationally.","In emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 4% operationally, due primarily to 3% growth in the legacy established products portfolio and 9% growth in the sterile injectables portfolio.","Fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.13, compared with the loss of $0.03 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the non-recurrence of foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela, a Protonix-related legal matter, and pension settlements in the prior-year quarter, and a lower effective tax rate in Q4 of 2016 compared with Q4 of 2015. These were partially offset by fewer selling days, foreign exchange impacts, higher restructuring costs, and losses related to the early redemption of debt and the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.47 versus $0.53 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to fewer selling days, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, continuing product losses of exclusivity, and a higher effective tax rate, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth due to certain new inline and acquired products and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter 2016 revenues by approximately $228 million or 2% and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $50 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.03 related to Venezuela. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange had a $0.21 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS, with approximately $0.10 attributable to Venezuela.","As you can see, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our 2016 financial guidance ranges. It's important to note that every major currency except the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2016, which negatively impacted our full year 2016 revenues by approximately $1.5 billion, of which $778 million was attributable to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.","In full year 2016, we generated 11% operational revenue growth, and excluding legacy Hospira and legacy Medivation operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew 5% operationally. I also want to point out that 2016 adjusted SI&A expenses were at the top end of our guidance range as a result of spending to support new products including Ibrance, Eliquis, Prevnar adult, Xeljanz, and biosimilars.","Now I'd like to walk you through the 2017 guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2016 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2017 financial guidance assumes the pending disposition of Hospira Infusion Systems in February 2017 and excludes its $1.2 billion contribution to 2016 revenues and its $0.03 contribution to adjusted diluted EPS in 2016.","Also, while our 2017 revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, inline, and acquired products, this growth is partially offset by an anticipated $2.4 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $900 million negative impact due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Consequently, we're absorbing a negative impact of $4.5 billion related to these three factors. In addition, I'd like to clarify for modeling purposes that while expanding revenues from the U.S. are included in alliance revenues, revenues that our generated outside the U.S. are booked as royalty and therefore included in other income.","In summary, we expect our 2017 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion. I also want to point out that the midpoint of this revenue range implies another year of mid-single digit operational growth, excluding the impact of the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange.","Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, as I mentioned, excludes the contribution from the Hospira Infusion Systems and includes the negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, as well as an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange. In addition, the guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS incorporates $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2017, which are expected to more than offset potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. As a result, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. The midpoint of this range implies operational growth of approximately 10%, excluding the impact of the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange.","Moving on to key takeaways, we finished full year 2016 with 5% standalone operational revenue growth, excluding Hospira and Medivation. We issued 2017 financial guidance. Excluding the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems and foreign exchange, the midpoint of the revenue guidance range implies another year of mid-single digit operational growth, and the midpoint of the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflects approximately 10% operational growth. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, including the European Commission's approval of Ibrance for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and the FDA's approval of Eucrisa for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years of age and older. We returned $12.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Operator, at this point can we poll for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'd like to ask you about Immuno-Oncology and just the commitment to the agreement on avelumab and with your partner, Merck KGaA. As you outlined, you've got lots of registration-enabling trials ongoing and lots of combinations. Should we interpret that as meaning that you're fully committed to that partnership and to avelumab? Or is it in the realm of possibilities that in this fast-changing world of I-O, where the landscape continues to shift, you have to be more open-minded to continually reassess the way and try to become a leader in this area? And maybe Merck KGaA and the assets that you have in development don't quite get you there.","Then a second question is on border tax. Can we just get your perspective for how you think this whole issue might play out both in the nearer and longer term? Do you think this proposal has legs? My understanding is that it could clearly be a potential negative for multinational drug companies.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Tim, thank you for the question. Regarding avelumab and our partnership with Merck KGaA, we believe avelumab is a highly competitive molecule, and we're focused along with our partner on delivering its promise as both monotherapy and in combination with other agents.","In the I-O area, we believe that having a backbone with a PD-L1 compound is necessary but insufficient in the future competitive environment. So we see avelumab as potentially competitive in selected first-line settings but believe the true value will be in combinations, potentially with targeted agents such as Inlyta, antibody drug conjugates, analytic (27:00) vaccines, and other I-O agents such as OX40, 4-1BB, IDS1 (27:05), and drugs in Pfizer's pipeline. So I think that addresses most of the risk and concerns you have about our strategy. Everybody needs, I think, a PD-L1, but that's just the chip to the entry. After that, you need an extensive portfolio around combinations to really open up the value of immuno-oncology.","On the issue of border tax, look, the tax codes are complicated \u2013 or the tax suggestions are complicated. I think the Republican leadership has overall tax changes that are overall favorable for the pharmaceutical industry. Certainly would allow us to create more jobs in the United States. And I don't really think that we would feel that the changes as being proposed are negative for our industry \u2013 far more positive, in fact. Frank, do you want to add something to that?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","I'd just punctuate what Ian said, which is I don't think you can look at one individual \u2013 one potential individual part of reform. You got to look at what the total package would look like. So it'll include what's going to be corporate taxes? What are going to be the impact on future foreign earnings? Base erosion, which is where border adjustability comes in. Accumulated foreign earnings, interest expense deductibility. So I think what we'll need is we need the full picture, the full puzzle, instead of just trying to comment on one individual piece of it.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank and Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First of all, on just appetite and priorities for business development from here. And as you're just thinking about that, would a repatriation kind of tax holiday or broader tax reform affect any of your capital deployment or business development priorities? Basically, could that make deals that didn't make sense previously make sense given the new capital structure?","Second question was just maybe talking a little bit more about Prevnar. We had a step down in sales this quarter. You've talked about sales to be flat to maybe modestly declining in 2017. Could you just elaborate a little bit more? Where are we with regards to the in adult kind of bolus in the U.S.? And how should we think about this kind of ramp in Europe offsetting potential further erosion of the U.S. opportunity? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chris. Well, I'll make a few comments on the BD. Frank, you may want to add something, and then we'll go over to Albert for a discussion on the Prevnar vaccines.","To the extent \u2013 I'd like to point out that the most impactful thing with tax reform will be to level the playing field between U.S. companies and foreign companies in regards of the foreign companies not having the tax advantage of acquiring companies and then taking it to a low-tax location. So that'll be a fundamental change in competitiveness. To the extent that tax changes would make it cheaper for us to access financing, then you're quite right. Some deals that previously would not have been affordable, may now be affordable.","But the lens we look at it is always from the point of view of creating value for shareholders. So per se I don't see that the tax reform alters our approach to doing BD, which is, are we going to generate above our cost of capital in making this investment, and is it, both short- and long-term, the right think for shareholders? So I hope that answers on BD, and we'll go over to Albert to talk about vaccines.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Prevnar 13 is expected to continue to be a significant program. Overall this year, we expect Prevnar 13 to be flat to declining. And this is a result of complex movements in the marketplace. As discussed previously, in the U.S. we have already vaccinated approximately 50% of the 65-plus population. So we expect to continue to see a decline here in the adult indication, as we exhaust the catch-up opportunity (31:09). This will be offset by international adult growth, and growth of adult vaccinations in the 19 to 64 age range. And we will also see a modest growth in pediatric indication.","From our perspective, moving forward in U.S. and in EU, in the U.S. we are focused on protecting the remaining 50% of the 65-plus population and expanding uses to 19-64 age range. We are aware that vaccinating the remaining 50% is more challenging than it was to vaccinate the first half. And to realize the full potential of 19-64 we need an SEP (31:53) recommendation, but we are moving forward with plans given the current situation.","In Europe, as you know, it's all about recommendations and reinvestments. We continue to advocate with vaccine technical committees for recommendations and payers for reinvestments. The timing of the success varies country by country and in some cases region by region within the same country. Last couple of data (32:17) in 2016, we had relatively limited number of recommendations and reinvestments. We had in Denmark and we had one region in Spain, Madrid region. In 2017 we expect funding decisions in a number of important markets, like France, Italy, and Belgium.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. And, as you know, I think we've said in the release that we expect, given the pressures on the ability to get into the residual 50% of the adult markets, we expect sort of flat to slightly down for our overall Prevnar franchise next year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Operator, can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, one, again going back to the business development and some of the D.C.-related comments you made earlier. I'm just wondering, in terms of \u2013 given there's a lot of uncertainty around how everything's going to play out in terms of corporate tax and border pricing, all these issues, is it fair to say that there might be a little bit of a pause in Pfizer's desire to do larger scale business development until these issues are sorted out, presumably later this year?","And then my second question that I had just relates to Xtandi. And I'm just curious on that product sort of your expectations given how much you paid for that asset in your acquisition last year. J&J commented a little bit last week around some market contraction that they're seeing in that space. And I'm just curious if you can give a little bit more color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volumes and pricing from Xtandi? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On the BD, I don't see it as a pause. We're going to play the cards we get dealt. As I said, the change in the tax code may reduce competition for assets from external buyers. It may alter somewhat the overall cost to make an acquisition, but it's not dramatic in the sense of we're going to take a year pause or so while we see what the tax code's going to do. We're going to continue to do BD where we see value for our shareholders. We think we have the flexibility on the balance sheet to do that, and so I don't see a dramatic pause. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Just that since September of 2015, with the current cards we've been dealt, with the current tax laws as they're written, we've done approximately $40 billion in deals, all of which obviously we believe are or will create shareholder value. And, to Ian's point, if we get dealt a new set of cards, a new hand, then obviously we'll play that hand. And once again the compass never changes. The compass is always creating shareholder value.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Albert, on Xtandi?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Vamil, let me provide some insight of the market dynamics and then also provide our expectations for the product. Xtandi revenues in Q4 declined 8% versus Q3 of the same year and 13% versus same quarter of last year. However, Xtandi demand, as measured by specialty pharma, was up \u2013 increased 4% in Q4 versus Q3 and over 9% versus the same quarter of last year.","The same inconsistency between revenues and demand is also observed on a full-year basis, where revenues were up by 8%, while total prescriptions were up by 15%. This inconsistency is due to changes in the demand mix, with a significant increase in patient assistance program last quarter, which impact revenue. This spike in PAP programming is unprecedented compared with prior experiences.","We remain confident in the growth potential of Xtandi in the metastatic first stage cancer market for the following reasons: We expect to continue to grow sir (36:36) with both oncologists and urologists. Urology is where the largest growth potential exists. Currently the number of oncologists prescribing the product is almost 4,000 of a universe of 6,500. The number of urologists prescribing Xtandi now grew to around 1,400 this quarter. However, there is still a great opportunity with over 5,500 urologists prescribing casodex.","The publication of the positive data from TERRAIN, which is the only study demonstrating superiority against casodex, head to head, will have a significant impact. Recent market research showed a significant increase in prescribing intent by both oncologists and urologists that were aware of current data versus those that were not aware. Beginning of January 1 this year, we put a strong commercial management team in place from Pfizer. Given our strong reputation and experience in both oncology and urology, together with partner Astellas, we expect to accelerate the Xtandi growth.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thank you, Albert. Our next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. My question is for you, Ian. As you know, President Trump is meeting with a group of industry executives right now as we speak, and he said he wants to bring drug pricing down. Do you think that the industry is doing enough to quell concerns out there? And, if this comes to a head \u2013 I mean, how do you think it does come to a head? How are we going to get closure on this drug pricing issue? Will the industry have to give something up? How do you look at it? And just specifically on your price increases, which you announced January 1, are you holding to one price increase a year? Can you comment on that? I think it's just interesting that a number of the distributors this morning said that they are expecting that drug companies will raise prices again in the June and July time period. So just sort of your overall views on how this is all going to come to a head. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jami. On our price increases are, I don't want to get into the will and the when we increase prices for simply competitive reasons. But we are not changing our philosophy vis-\u00e0-vis how we price our medications and when we take those price increases.","And regarding the meeting with President Trump, which I couldn't attend because I'm on this analyst call, I'd like to sort of broaden exactly and look at what he said. He said, well, number one, you need to get manufacturing back to America, so that falls squarely inside of getting a tax reform which allows us to reinvest in the United States and create jobs. So I think we can be a very positive part of the story of creating jobs in the United States if we get the tax reform.","Regulations. He's going to cut up to 80% to help streamline the approval process. That will help with drug prices, because it'll induce more competition. We have been advocating for a long time to speed up the approval of generics and remove the barriers to their approval, because that will help with drug prices.","Regulations, the way insurance is delivered. Cost to consumers, which is really, I think, what the president is talking about. Cost to patients is driven by the fact that the out-of-pocket expense on average for a patient to visit a hospital is 3%, but on his drug bill it's 15%. So we'd like to see regulations that would allow that unfair playing field to be squared up. It'd be positive to get a new FDA head and very positive if we can \u2013 if young companies (40:53) and companies can be \u2013 get to the market quicker. And that's good for us and good for the whole system.","So I think complexity of drug prices involve all of the other comments he made. And I think there are lots of ways, like changing regulations to allow value-based contracting between the industry and the health system, will also be very helpful. We have a regulation that was created for fee-for-service, and now we need regulations in a new world of value-based pricing. So I think there's lots of ways we can work with the administration to ensure that patients have affordable drugs \u2013 or more affordable drugs in the United States. I think that covered most of what you asked.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Jami. Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. First of all, I'd like to thank the Pfizer organization for all the help while I was gone, especially Chuck, Ryan, and Bryan helping my team. Thank you.","I wanted to ask again about the possibility of a repatriation holiday. So maybe this is a question for Frank. But I just want to understand if I'm doing this right. Your OUS cash, I believe, is at least $14 billion, I think is what you said publicly, not updated for the 4Q. Your leverage ratio right now, total debt to EBITDA, is something around 1, 1.3, somewhere in there. I believe you said you'd be willing to go to at least 2. And I'm wondering if \u2013 my understanding is that if you're able to repatriate cash, you probably alleviate some of your needs for short term paper in the U.S. So, in the event of a tax repatriation holiday, how high, Frank, would you allow your leverage ratio to go? And would you consider maximizing your borrowing to maximize cash on hand?","And, then second of all, if you don't mind, just the 5% operational growth for the year in revenue. Can you break out price versus volume?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mark, I know you've directed most of the questions to Frank; I think he can give you the answers you're looking for. I'd just like to say welcome back. Good to have you back on the calls.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, welcome back, Mark. I also wanted to also say that, too. So, listen, on capital structure, the real punchline to the question was how high would we go? Let me run a few numbers, and then I'll answer the question, which is at the end of last quarter we had about $24 billion in cash. We say at any point in time, up to $10 billion of that is in the U.S. So that $24 million minus that $10 million that disclosed is how you got to your $14 billion. At the end of last quarter, we had give or take about $44 billion in debt. So if you put the debt of $44 billion, put that on our EBITDA number, you get a number that's close to 2. If you do a net debt number, which is probably the calculation that you did, you get to a leverage ratio that's about 1, 1 and change, which is, I'm assuming how you got to the basis of your question.","In terms of how high we would go on leverage, the answer is, it depends on what we're doing. I mean, quite frankly, to lock myself in on a number really to me isn't an appropriate thing. It really depends on what is the use of capital? And the compass on capital, whether it's business development, whether it's buybacks, whether it's dividends, whether it's investing in our business, but the compass is how do we maximize capital deployment to maximize shareholder value? So that's how we think about it. To the extent we need it to lever up because we think there'd be an opportunity that made sense, we'd lever up. But to lever up just to lever up isn't what we're all about. So that's how I'd answer that.","On price, I think the way I'll answer it is I believe for the full year our operational revenue growth all in was 11%. Then you took out \u2013 you made a couple adjustments to get to 5%. But I look at the 11%, the majority of that 11% is volume. Low single digits, approximately 2% of that, is price.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, with respect to pipeline news flow in 2017, could you just highlight what the top two or three readouts are in your mind that we should be focused on?","And then second, with respect to future business development, you've obviously commented on it in some detail, but it would be helpful to get some more perspective on what your expectations are for potential timing on large transactions. It would seem that it would be most beneficial for Pfizer to have clarity on the likelihood of tax reform and\/or repatriation before pursuing a very substantial transaction. But would love to get your comments on that, Frank. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, I'll ask Mikael to do the pipeline flow, and then myself and Frank will answer your BD question.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you for the question. I think we are in a really good rhythm with the pipeline. Actually over the last six years we have had over 20 key approvals with an average of three to four approvals per year, and the pipeline, the quantity and the quality that we have of the pipeline of more than 90 programs in clinical development, we'll have a similar flow or even more. Actually in 2017 and 2018 we expect about five approvals every year.","Concerning readouts, and I'll focus mainly on pivotal studies that are registration enabling, we will have about 15 pivotal readouts in 2017 and 2018. Particularly in 2017, more near term, I can mention readouts expected for dacomitinib, lorlatinib, avelumab in certain indications, and also two of our biosimilars. And there will be a continuous flow up to 15 pivotal readouts in total, 2017 and 2018.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Frank, would you like to have a stab (47:37) at the BD question?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. And, Dave, you commented specifically you mentioned large transactions. The way I'd answer the question is \u2013 and Ian and I have both said this before \u2013 we always start with we're agnostic to size when it comes to business development. Our compass is, will continue to be, shareholder value.","In terms of the other part of your question about access to overseas cash, or easier access to overseas cash, clearly that would be beneficial. That would be favorable, all other things being equal. But in terms of does that make it easier to do deals? The answer is it depends. For example, what happens to the valuations of all the companies? If it's easier to have access to overseas cash, does that drive valuations and prices up? So the compass has to continue to be shareholder value, return on capital, relative to our cost of capital. That's what we've always done. That's what we'll continue to do. But at a macro level, all other things being equal, does easier access to our global cash help us, is it more favorable? The answer is yes. But there's other factors that we'll have to understand as we work our way through business development.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with a very broad question on -","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John, we can't hear you. You need to speak up, sorry.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sure. Can you hear me now?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Much better, John. Loud and clear.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. So the first question is just a very broad question on how fragmented the pharmaceutical industry is relative to other industries. Can you just give your thoughts on consolidation, and especially in light of the pricing pressures, just your thoughts on the need for the industry to consolidate? There's a lot of manufacturing inefficiencies out there, just a lot of inefficiencies in the industry in general. So that's the first broad question.","Second question, in 2006 you made a decision to sell your consumer business. Is there any way of giving some quantification as to what kind of earnings contribution you currently get from the consumer business? And if you were to consider externally selling it, how would you offset that dilution? Would you add to that $5 billion share repurchase?","Third question, Ibrance. Was there any \u2013 obviously outperformance, great performance on the brand in the quarter. Was there any additional product put into the channel on Ibrance? Was that all sell-through?","And then lastly, Ian, applaud your highlighting the 96 clinical programs you have, but one thing I hear a lot from investors is that you haven't had an R&D meeting in a long time. Would love to see that innovation displayed in front of the investment community. Any thoughts about doing an R&D meeting?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you, John. Four good questions.","So the issue of fragmentation. So if I look at it from a society point of view, society has to decide, do they want continuing \u2013 a flexible (50:45) organization with lots of shots on goal? If they do, they need to continue to support that and support it through a robust market-based system in the United States. To the extent that that would change, and we don't have a robust ability to recover our value, then I do think you'd see the fragmentation disappear and innovation would go down. So it's a sort of really macro decision that the government has to make or society has to make as to how much progress and how fast do they want to see progress and how much resources they're willing to put behind it. And that would dictate, I think, the fragmentation or infragmentation (51:19) of the industry.","Vis-\u00e0-vis the consumer business, we don't give out obviously our profits for sub-businesses, but we see it as an asset that is valuable to us, valuable to our shareholders. And just like all of our portfolio and all of our assets, if there's a better mix, we're always open to it, but it has to be for strategic reasons rather than cash.","On Ibrance, I'll ask Albert to talk a little bit about Ibrance, but before he does, you asked about the R&D portfolio.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","R&D day.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","R&D day. Well, look, let's look at it. We haven't had one for some time. I haven't often found them that productive. We give you a lot of visibility by publishing on Clinical.com (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] (52:15). Mikael's available to analysts whenever they want to talk about the science. More than willing for you to come in and talk to Mikael, John. So I'm not sure that a big R&D day really is worth the disruption and the focus on getting it done vis-\u00e0-vis explaining what we're doing, but we'll take a look at it.","Okay, Ibrance, Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","It was a great performance for Ibrance, John. As we said, exceeded $2 billion this year in the second year of its launch, and it was almost 200% growth. And this excellent financial performance is driven by underlying demand, and there was no abnormal situations in inventories.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. And, Frank, why don't you add some more on the consumer?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so, John, just to run some numbers to help you in terms of answering your question. So for the quarter, consumer revenues, $950 million, plus 4% operationally. For the year, $3.4 billion, up 5% operationally. We don't give specific margins, but one of the things we do say about the consumer business is that the margins are lower than the pharmaceutical business because it's a less risky business. That gives you enough information, I think, to be able to really ballpark what the number is.","And, by the way, in terms of just the theory or the case of when we divest an asset, how do we deal with it from a dilution or accretive perspective? The answer is it depends, but think about Zoetis. We did a big buyback. We did a share exchange. And so even though we divested what was a very good, very profitable company, we wound up making that transaction accretive. So there's lots of ways for us to do that. You mentioned share buybacks, and, yes, that's clearly one of the ways when we divest assets that we can deal with accretion and dilution.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Our next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I want to dig in a little bit on the biosimilar franchise. What can you guys tell us about the Inflectra experience so far in the U.S.? And then what's the Pfizer view of the new interchangeability guidance and what it means to speed to market? And then, at a higher level, when your biosimilar franchise scales to add more assets, do you think about gross to net any differently? In other words, is the long-term value here biased to more margin contribution or more revenue growth? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John, would you like to comment on that?","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so first of all, I think we obviously are very positive about the opportunity that we have with biosimilars. First of all, the commercial opportunity to provide real value to our shareholders, but also the opportunity that biosimilars represent to continue to bring some of the competition that Ian referred to, to the healthcare system and to bring efficiencies and savings. So we think the opportunities in both regards are very significant.","It's obviously very early days of Inflectra in the U.S. We're literally in the first \u2013 this is just the second month of launch, so it's early days. We anticipate that the uptake in the first few months in the U.S. will be slow. That represents our progress in Europe, where we've seen that actually after the first few months as physicians get comfortable with biosimilars, we've seen the rate of uptake really begin to accelerate.","Just to give you a data point to compare in Europe, the uptake of biosimilars overall for infliximab in Europe is something like 28%, 29% in the second year. So we're actually very satisfied with what we've seen about the progress of biosimilars can make when we begin to get information about how a high-quality biosimilar and our data can really actually deliver significant value to the healthcare system.","In regard to your second question about the portfolio, we certainly continue to have, as you've heard from Ian and Frank, a bias to shareholder value. So our compass, whether it's in BD, as Ian and Frank have talked about, or when it comes to the individual contribution of a product portfolio such as biosimilars, will always be around shareholder value. And so we certainly are very positive about the opportunities for revenue growth, but our compass is always going to be shareholder value as we determine how to invest in that portfolio going forward.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Many thanks. I have two questions. First for Ian. As someone who's been in the industry for a long time, I would be interested in how you view the current potential threat from government intervention on drug pricing versus that sporadically over the last 20 or 30 years. Would you say it is now among the most significant threat you've ever seen? Would you say it's similar to past periods or not as severe?","And then a question for Dr. Dolsten on JAVELIN 100. The study is similar to KEYNOTE-024 and CheckMate 026, reads out this summer, the PD-L1 expression threshold is 1%. Is Pfizer amending the protocol to use a higher threshold? Since otherwise it seems that the study is unlikely to be successful. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Steve, on the relative threat, it's a good question. I think the misinformation is far greater than I've ever seen before out in the marketplace. And we're seeing added onto previous price discussions the behavior of companies that work in the generics sector, who are moving to change their prices in a volatile manner, hence creating a negative perception there. But if you actually look at the price increases of the branded pharmaceutical companies as a whole for 2015, it was 2.8%. So if you separate the hysteria, frankly, in the media and often the examples are companies that are in the generic market, then I think it's really a huge amount of misinformation out there that we and the pharma as an organization needs to begin to start dealing with (58:26).","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So great to get the question on our clinical strategies. We always carefully monitor new learning in clinical science to make sure we try and incorporate them into our studies, and this is true also for the JAVELIN first-line lung cancer study, where we are obviously incorporating the best way to define the patients concerned in PD-L1, and you can be certain that our patient population we've optimized for what is the best knowledge how to get the likely maximum response to a PD-L1 inhibitor such as avelumab.","Finally, I just wanted to add, beyond the monotherapy, which we think will be a productive profile for initial monotherapy, we worked on doublets and triplets with 4-1BB and OX40 that will over time, we think, be able to move the needle even further, including indications such as lung cancer.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First for John Young. John, do you think the Essential business can grow without deals and without the benefit of innovative projects coming over the wall, over time? Can you also give us a roadmap for what biosimilar launches Pfizer might have in the next two to three years? And comment on your copaxone ANDA status in light of the legal ruling?","And over to Ian and Frank. Rather than asking you to predict as to what replaces the Affordable Care Act and when, could I ask you to quantify the effect you think the ACA has had on Pfizer? Industry fee, donut hole, increased volume potentially, biotech exclusivity. These are the things that come to mind. But how do you quantify what ACA has done for Pfizer as we think about where that may go in the future? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Please, John.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question, Gregg. So I think we have been fairly consistent in terms of saying that we really believe that we have a strategy and a portfolio that can return the Pfizer Essential Health business to some sustainable growth after the impact of LOEs has begun to lessen. We certainly still have an impact of some LOEs in our portfolio, as you know, but that impact will lessen over the next few years. And I think we believe that just strategically at a high level, the strength that we have in our emerging market business that would be typically in most of the large emerging markets, number one or two in most of those countries. We have the leading sterile injectable business, leading biosimilars business. And within our, what we think of as our global brand portfolio, we actually also have the largest portfolio of anti-infectives in the business. So we believe that those core areas of strength really provide an opportunity for us to really drive this business to sustainable growth.","Just to run some numbers for you. Whilst in the fourth quarter this year, the growth of the business overall was minus 6%, if you adjust for the impact of LOEs, giving you a sense of what is actually happening to the core business without that headwind, the answer is flat. But if you adjust for and equalize for the selling days, which I think Frank highlighted in his opening comments, that core business grew by 6%. So I think it hopefully gives you a sense that we are actually growing those portfolios that we believe will be the positive drivers of growth going forward. We'll continue to look at opportunities to strengthen those portfolios. And certainly our aspirations for setting (1:02:06) this business to sustainable growth remains undimmed.","In terms of biosimilar launches, as you know, we are also \u2013 we're very well-positioned to be the leader that we are today in terms of revenues, but actually a leader over the next five to 10 years given the strength of our portfolio. In the relatively near term, we anticipate that in the 2018, 2019 timeframe we'll be able to file around about five biosimilar products. I think you're aware of the products that we have in our pipeline. We certainly have potential biosimilars for trastuzumab for cancer; for bevacizumab, also for cancer; for adalimumab, which is an anti-TNF product and one of the biggest products in the world; and rituximab; as well as EPO, which we filed in response to the complete response letter that Hospira had previously received. And we filed that response in December of last year.","So when you look at all of those drivers, both combining that with the early stage pipeline that we have, we believe we're really well-positioned to have a rich pipeline of biosimilars in the marketplace over the medium term. Thanks for the question, Gregg.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Gregg, thank you. I'm going to just point out some of the \u2013 I'll get Frank to go through some of the costs of ACA first. I'd like to just make the point that there was no windfall for our industry from the expected 20 million more patients. Because mostly these patients were not treated with a type of \u2013 given the level of insurance they have, they didn't really have access to innovative drugs. So there was very little revenue growth from the exchanges for Pfizer (1:03:54) the expenses of the ACA.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So the donut hole in the fee on pharma sales this year for the full year, Gregg, $722 million. Now, by the way, the thing to add to that is the Medicaid component, although it's very hard to really come up with that number now because many states have moved to managed Medicaid. But if I just ballpark that number and assume it's been roughly the same as it was a couple years ago, that number grosses up to about $1.25 billion. And you divide that by, call it, 80 million per share pre-tax to that $1.25 billion, $0.15, $0.16 a share. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Can we move on to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Morning. Looks like another year of flat spending. Can you talk about the push and pulls specifically on SG&A for this year? But also just more broadly, just philosophically, it looks like R&D SG&A the past couple years has been flattish. Should we be thinking flattish for the next couple years as we model? And basically however the top line drives the bottom line?","And then, second of all, just on Ibrance, you mentioned there was no unusual inventory, but you also on the quarter usually give us some metrics, how many patients were on the product and what kind of penetration rates you've got in first line and second line. That would be helpful. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Why don't you do the Ibrance, Albert? Then we'll get back to the movement of R&D and -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","A side comment (1:05:27).","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Marc, let me give you a brief overview of the performance of Ibrance. And let me start by saying how happy we are with the success. Ibrance has been prescribed in the U.S. by approximately 9,500 physicians. This is up from 8,500 that were in Q3. It's been given to approximately 50,000 patients. Our initial on strategy was to establish Ibrance as the standard of care with early adopting physicians.","Moving forward, we believe the growth will come from late adopters, many of whom have already prescribed Ibrance, but in a limited number of patients. 20% of the approximately 12,000 prescribing physicians in the U.S. have not yet prescribed the product. From those already prescribing it, approximately 30% have only one or two patients on Ibrance. With the publication of PALOMA-2, we think that this is important data for these late-adopting physicians. Let's not forget that the study demonstrated more than two years PFS, making at the first and only treatment of this population to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study.","And then last, to answer your question, our internal market shares are approximately 45% in first line for the quarter, 40% in second line, and 25% approximately in the third line.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. I'm going to make a couple of comments on your question from the sort of strategic point of view of our expenditure in R&D and SG&A, and then I'll ask Frank to give you more analysis. So we spend in SG&A and R&D according to the opportunities we see and how we can create value. So that layer is always there, and expectations of R&D and SG&A are really related to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. Underneath that, though, we have consistent programs to look for efficiencies in how we do R&D, how we deliver our SG&A. And perhaps Frank can comment upon some of those efficiencies. So right now, looking at it, I'm satisfied with the level of support we have next year for SG&A and R&D, and each budget cycle we look at it, look at the opportunities and the growth we can get from those opportunities. Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, maybe I'll give you some of the puts and takes, Marc, to see if that helps. So \u2013 and I'll run some numbers first. So let's do SI&A. So last year, the SI&A actual number for 2016 full year was $14.7 billion. Our guidance for 2017 is $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion, with a midpoint of $14.2 billion. There's a lot going on underneath those numbers, so if you look at the $14.7 billion compared to $14.2 billion, just in terms of the midpoint of the guidance, what's going on there? One is ongoing cost reduction programs that Ian alluded to. Two is we get the benefit of the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems. Right, so that comes out. And then foreign exchange actually helped SI&A to the tune of about $200 million. We called that out.","So think about that as things that are helping the number, but then there's offsets against that. So for example, we get the full year effect of Mediviation next year \u2013 launch costs for that, launch costs for Eucrisa, which is another area. Spend on some of our other areas. But those are the kinds of things that are going on in terms of $13.7 billion, $14.7 billion, what the midpoint is relative to next year. There's items that are driving the number down. There's items that are driving the number up.","If you look at R&D, same kind of, I'll call it, puts and takes. So last year, 2016, $7.8 billion. Guidance for this year, $7.5 billion to $8 billion, so the midpoint's roughly the same as last year, which is part of the basis of your question. But once again, lots going on there. So for example, the large boco charge we had in the fourth quarter comes out. So that would reduce spending all other things equal. On the other hand, we've got the Medivation acquisition, and we're actually increasing our investment in things like Ibrance, immuno-oncology, and see (1:09:27) some of our late-stage pipeline assets. So when you put that all together, we get to that range of $7.5 billion and so just kind of the rhythm of the numbers. (1:09:46)","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Couple of questions, please. It seems as if a new administration is proposing lower drug prices in exchange for accelerating development timelines for drugs. Do you really believe that that's the underlying issue with the economics of pharmaceutical industry? Does that represent a fair trade to you?","And then, second, in terms of the industry group highlighting other players in the healthcare value chain who may be contributing to drug price inflation, perhaps you might like to comment both on the role of the PBMs, as well as on the 340B hospital program.","And then very quickly on biosimilars. In relation to your oncology biosimilars, could you outline what you think the anticipated adoption rate and market impact will be, how fast, and in particular to which customer groups in the U.S. you think you're going to be most accessible in the initial launch period? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So your question on the administration, I would look at it this way. I think to the extent that \u2013 and I would hope this is how the administration's thinking of it \u2013 to the extent that they can remove regulations and make it easier and faster to bring drugs to market, that will make the marketplace a lot more competitive, which will then in turn help to bring down drug prices. I believe that this is the philosophy of the administration, to ensure there's competition in the marketplace, and that would be one way of ensuring that drug prices are modified some way.","Regarding your comment about the difference between our price and the list price, I think we get \u2013 I think there's a study that recently came out indicating the percentage we get of the list price. So we have got into a marketplace, and the way the marketplace has developed, that we have list prices but then rebates negotiated that gives a net price. I believe there are alternative systems where we could have just as an efficient system but where the list prices could be lower and the net prices would stay substantially the same or might drop slightly because of the middleman not making so much money in the middle. But that's very complex, and we need to come up with a competitive marketplace solution to that. But I do believe that's one of the problems in the market today, because people without insurance or through the deductibles are hit with the list price rather than the net price through the insurance companies. So maybe there are ways we can work with the insurance company administration to get rid of this big difference between list price and net price.","And the last question was for John on biosimilars.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","So thanks for the question, Andrew. So obviously there are no currently available oncology product biosimilars, either from our portfolio or any other company's portfolio in either the U.S. or Europe or any other major market around the world. So to some extent it's very early days to conjecture what reach of uptake might be. Yet what I can say is that we are very positive about the pipeline that we have. As I mentioned earlier, we have bevacizumab, a potential biosimilar to Avastin. We have rituximab, a potential biosimilar to Rituxan, and we have a potential biosimilar, trastuzumab, to Herceptin. And we're very positive about the way that those clinical programs are unfolding.","I think in oncology, it's very likely that biosimilars will be used initially for new patients. I think it's probably unlikely that oncologists will choose to change a patient's therapy, but given the particular dynamics where patients by definition start and finish courses of therapy more often we don't see that as being an inhibition in any way to the uptake once physicians actually see the clinical data for a biosimilar and then can make an informed decision along with their patients around how to most appropriately manage their course of therapy.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Securities","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Three very brief questions. Frank, have efficiencies in gross margins actually been totally wrung out to date?","And number two, to John Young again on biosimilars, do you believe in the U.S. that overall demand is dependent upon formulary positioning \u00e0 la pushing a brand back to a higher tier for where your biosimilar may be at a lower tier as opposed to physician pull-through?","And then finally to Mikael Dolsten on first-line lung, yet once again, do you wait until JAVELIN 100 completes before moving forward with the combination studies? Or are you already underway with those? And I noticed or cannot find any trials other than in head and neck, which has radiation which may involve chemotherapy plus avelumab. So I'm curious how you and\/or Pfizer think about that and combinations specifically for lung? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and, Tony, I'll answer it by using cost of sales, which is basically the same thing. So think about it this way: Our cost of sales in 2016 was 22% of revenue for the full year. Our guidance for 2017 is 20% to 21%, so midpoint to that guidance 20.5%. So we're actually down from 22% to a range of 20% to 21% in 2017. Couple things going on there. One is more alliance revenue, so alliance revenue we book is \u2013 we book the revenue based on net gross profit, so there's no COGS. So that obviously helps the percentage, but also ongoing cost reduction programs taking place in our factories and throughout the company. And then there's -the offset to that is we've got 2.4 billion of LOEs next year, some of which obviously have a negative impact on the cost of sales. But when you put that together the short answer is we're going down year over year and no, the short answer is no, we haven't wrung it out completely. There's always opportunities to continue to improve in everything that we do.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question on biosimilars, Tony. So I'm going to, I think, just hit on a couple points I made already, which is clearly one component of ensuring appropriate uptake for biosimilars in the marketplace is physician education, making sure that they're familiar with your clinical data, the strength of your program, and we also believe actually the importance of the company profile in your experience in biosimilars. That said, plainly access is a critical component as well. And we're absolutely clear that ensuring that we can negotiate appropriate patient access and we take the steps necessary to ensure that patients can have access to high-quality biosimilars is equally important.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so great to hear about your interest in how we'll evolve the I-O combinations. So as we have optimized JAVELIN 100 for PD-L1 monotherapy, and I think based on current experiences across the field of PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, one can assume that monotherapy may be particularly robust in the PD-L1 height (1:17:27) fraction of tumors but likely of less magnitude in PD-L lower lung cancers. We have several Phase 1 studies ongoing where we study combination of avelumab, such as JAVELIN Lung 101, which contains avelumab plus ALK inhibitors Xalkori\/lorlatinib for ALK+ lung cancer, and we also have JAVELIN Medley \u2013 and so the tumor basket studies that contain avelumab with 4-1BB, avelumab with OX40, and we're planning this quarter to start a triple, avelumab, 4-1BB, OX40, which likely, to the best of my knowledge, will be the first triple with these agents.","I should say that although you cannot predict outcome of combination drugs, it has been the history of oncology to evolve to that as we learn about single-agent activity. Both 4-1BB and OX40 show some single-agent activity, whether on clinical activity or important immunoparameters (1:18:40).","Finally, I should say that we also are starting studies where we combine avelumab with our own PDE4 inhibitor for the T790 mutation, which is a growing segment. We will review those data as they emerge in the first half of the year, particularly, avelumab, 4-1BB and OX40 data will emerge, and take rapid decisions together with our partner, Merck, (1:19:08) how to leverage those data, and we will certainly not wait to see an outcome of JAVELIN 100, as we think the design of combination studies can also contribute to expand and supplement the position we can have in monotherapy.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. Ian, maybe you can just kind of comment on the fact that I-O investment overall seems wildly inefficient. In that context, can you just discuss the general efficiency of pharma's investments into this area? And in oncology, if you think the industry should really be looking to consolidate more of that spend over time. Or should companies really be taking these independent paths, chasing the same targets?","And then the separate question is just for Frank. On the tax rate, can you just help us understand a little bit more the \u2013 relative to your current repatriation thresholds, what would the tax rate need to be in order to maximize your free flow of capital? Obviously 15%, I think, would get us there, which is the current proposal for a territorial tax system. But would 20% get us there? Would 22% get us there relative to forecasting your current pro forma tax rate, which typically runs between 22% and 25%? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Seamus, regarding your question, I think you can see that clearly with the way investors have treated initially BMS and Merck and those that have been the frontrunners on I-O, that they think it's a very effective investment strategy. The question you're really asking is, is there value to multiple shots on goal and multiple combinations? And there are a lot of combinations that you can try. So I think that the field is in its infancy and that implies some lack of efficiencies as we explore for leads and different ways to take these products forward, which will, over the medium term shake out. Now, whether you want people chasing \u2013 only one person chasing \u2013 only one company chasing one target, well that would be the result of not spending as much on research by not supporting prices and not supporting innovation. Okay. Taxes.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So, Seamus, on taxes, now let me run a few numbers, and then I'll answer the question which is, there's \u2013 really, there's kind of the proposals from the administration, there's the proposals from Paul Ryan and the rest of the Republicans. Think about it this way. You got to think of foreign earnings in terms of accumulated earnings to date and then future earnings. So on future earnings, the administration has a proposal, I believe, of 15% minimum tax, where Paul Ryan has a proposal that's basically a total territorial tax system that would bring it back at zero. Now that comes, by the way, with base erosion called border adjustability. By the way, I like that total territorial at zero. I mean that's kind of really good.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","(1:22:43)","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Puts us by the way, to Ian's point, in terms of a level playing field with our competitors. If you look at accumulated earnings, so everything that's been accumulated already to date, the administration has a proposal of 10%, Paul Ryan has a proposal of I believe it's 8.75% on the cash, 3.5% on the noncash, and then it's payable over eight years. My short answer is the lower the better. We obviously want to have easier access to our overseas cash. And in terms of maximizing shareholder value, the lower that number is for us, the better it is for our shareholders. So my threshold, though, is low.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First, Ian, thank you for prioritizing your investors and being on the call as opposed to the White House. This morning, the president said that foreign countries must pay their fair share for drug development. This may not be a fair question to you, but do you think that is actually achievable? And if so, how could it be achieved?","And then also, forgive me, I'm not sure if I understood your earlier comments regarding the connection between U.S. manufacturing and tax reform. If you could clarify that.","And then on finally on the business, Hospira operational growth was a little bit lower than expected at 2%, given all the ex-U.S. launches. Can you provide some commentary there? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On the \u2013 stopping free riding is the way I'd put it. The economy's free ride on innovation paid for by Americans, clearly it's trade policy. It's how we interact and how we do our trade policies and how we negotiate them, and I think the president has been clear that he thinks that they haven't been negotiated hard enough. And as regards to free riding on American innovation of pharmaceuticals, I totally agree with him. And hopefully we will get something done on that. He certainly has declared his intentions to do so. I'll hand it over, the other question to John.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so thanks for the question. So we continue to be very positive about the contribution that Hospira has made to our business, both in terms of its strategic fit but also its operational performance. Just to run some numbers by you, our sterile injectable business for Hospira on the quarter as we printed it was flat. Our biosimilars business grew by 48%. The infusion systems business, which had some softness in the fourth quarter, declined by 9% and the total of minus 1%. But just to come back to the selling days true-up, that if you adjusted those for selling days and equalized between 2015 and 2016, the numbers become 9% growth for the sterile injectable business, 61% growth for the biosimilars business, infusion systems would be minus 2% compared to the minus 9%, and the total business would be 8% compared to the minus 1% when you adjust for selling days. So overall we remain very positive about the organic performance of that business.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So regarding the connection between tax reform, manufacturing, and bringing jobs back, we are not \u2013 as an industry, we're interested in highly qualified workforces that have been trained, and \u2013 but we're driven by the tax code today to manufacture outside of the United States. If there is no penalty by the border adjustment for manufacturing inside the United States to supply your markets outside of the United States, that will encourage us to put more jobs in the United States.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. And, operator, if we could take our last question, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks. I had a couple of quick product questions. Firstly, for Albert on Bosulif, do you see the results from the BFORE study allowing you to expand into the first-line setting in the face of Gleevec generics?","And then for Mikael or Albert on Ibrance, can you tell us when you expect to see the neoadjuvant breast cancer data from the PALLET study? And also, can you give us a quick update on how enrolment is going in PALLAS?","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Can you repeat the first question, Richard?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Bosulif?","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Sure, yeah. It was a question for Albert on Bosulif -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Bosulif.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","\u2013 the BFORE study, allowing you to expand into first line in the face of Gleevec generics.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, I think we'll ask Mikael to make some comments on that. And the second one was on -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Ibrance.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Ibrance. You can take those two, Mikael. Thanks.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you for noting the very strong performance of Bosulif in the BFORE study that was run with the venture group Avillion supporting us in developing into earlier line. We were really pleased with the data that we \u2013 I think have been released on a first type of high level that showed it outperformed Gleevec and showed superiority. So we think it will certainly give Bosulif an opportunity to be a major drug across all lines in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thank you for noting that.","When it comes to Ibrance, we have had solid enrollment for our early breast cancer trials, which I think reflect, as Albert has alluded to, the very favorable tolerability profile for a drug like Ibrance to be used. And we have both, as you know, PALLAS and PENELOPE. PALLAS is the broader study that covers both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients that will be treated with Ibrance for two years. The smaller PALLET trial, which is a Phase 2, more of a neoadjuvant trial, may read out later this year or possibly 2018. Always difficult to have a firm projection. We anticipate data could come this year.","That's a study that in some way will give additional data from a Wash U university study that was earlier shown at ASCO, which did show on Ki-67 as a proliferative molecule estrogen receptor-positive cancer cells as well as on clinical responses that Ibrance was very active in this equivalent of early breast cancer. And these are the endpoints but in a larger trial, Phase 2 APPELLATE (1:29:38), we look forward to the data and think if we just add more aspects of Ibrance and its activity across many segments of breast cancer, whether advanced, recurrent, or, here, earlier breast cancer.","Charles E.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2016 performance. As usual, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","Slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Third Quarter 2016, and this is located in the For Investors section in the lower right-hand corner of the page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, notably including part 1, item 1A, Risk Factors.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.","Starting with the quarter, we reported another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operationally.","Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth due to the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally; Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow, and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy \u2013 sorry, hormone therapy alone.","We also anticipate publication of our phase 3 PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field force to then detail on the strength of this data, which should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the right adopting physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance. A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise will be secure approval in the EU, where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect a decision from the commission later this year.","Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication earlier this year of the EAGLES study. Prevnar 13, sequentially we saw an increase this quarter in the adult indication as flu season approaches, and overall the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations.","Turning to the Pfizer Essential Health business, it achieved operational revenue growth, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and to a lesser extent from the Essential Health standalone sterile injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve modest sustainable growth. We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars, and emerging markets. Collectively, they may provide an offset to our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio, which by their nature are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given their multisource general decline in developing markets.","As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate continuing to refine the portfolio with business development activities, such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small-molecule anti-infectives business, and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems units to ICU Medical.","All in all, the PIH and PH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by the approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year. This has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest-growth therapeutic areas including biosimilars, sterile injectables with Hospira, medical rheumatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation, as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio are bolstering near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continues to mature and advance.","Turning to our pipeline, we remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline targeted in areas that have potential to have a meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders. Of particular note is our Oncology pipeline. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and mantle cell lymphoma. For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include important data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help physicians better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC \u2013 that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization early in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer.","For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our planned I-O strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Together with our partner Merck KGaA, we're on track to file avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S., and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated for review our market authorization application in the EU. Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and other small genotypes. However, we believe that doublets and triplets \u2013 that is, the combination of avelumab with other bio \u2013 drugs or with chemotherapy \u2013 are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making targeted investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy from targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year.","In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7, an ADC, is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in phase 1b, and combination studies with avelumab will commence in 2017. Our IDO1 inhibitor is also in phase 1, and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T cell program with Cellectis and Servier is on track, with recruitment in the UK ongoing.","In Inflammation & Immunology, through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January of 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We're also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S.","We continue to see strong potential to expand the label of indiscernible] (10:48) Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA, such as UC and psoriatic arthritis. We're excited about our next generation of selective JAK inhibitors currently in development.","In CV\/Met in September we reported positive phase 3 data for ertugliflozin in partnership with Merkel and are on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in two fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia, and ertugliflozin plus metformin, by the end of 2016.","As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interest of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug, as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug. The discontinuation decision was made based on the totality of information available to us across two key areas.","The first is the emerging clinical profile from our six completed phase 3 lipid-lowering studies. Specifically, with longer-term efficacy data now in hand, including from two recently completed 52-week studies for which top-line results were announced today, we have seen an unanticipated attenuation of LDL cholesterol lowering over time. Additionally, we have observed an unanticipated higher-level of immunogenicity and injection site reactions with bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class.","The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape of lipid-lowering agents in the PCSK9 class. In this market, a treatment's ability to impact CV outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of a cholesterol lowerer. And we have also recently seen payers establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential. Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape, led us to the conclusion that bococizumab was no longer likely to provide value to patients, physicians, or shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program.","In Rare Diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rare disease portfolio and enhances our leadership position in gene therapy. And with our partner SPARK, we are seeing data from the first seven patients being treated in our ongoing phase 1\/2 trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a one-time therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B.","In the Vaccines, we continue to advance Staph aureus and Clostridium difficile programs which are both currently in phase 2. We anticipate a C. difficile phase 2 readout before the year-end. And assuming it achieves its primary endpoint, we anticipate a potential phase 3 start in the first half of 2017.","And in Biosimilars we remain confident that we will be well-positioned in the emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we will begin shipment of Inflectra to wholesalers in the U.S. in late November. As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline milestones between now and the end of 2017 across several therapeutic areas.","To summarize, the remainder of this year we anticipate potential EU decisions for Ibrance, avelumab filing in the U.S. in Merkel cell carcinoma, ertugliflozin filing in the U.S., and C. difficile proof-of-concept readout. In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. decision for avelumab in Merkel cell carcinoma, potential lorlatinib submission in non-small-cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label extension for Xeljanz in UC and psoriatic arthritis, and potential crisaborole decision in the U.S. In addition, between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top-line readouts, with seven from Oncology, including the first I-O combination data readouts of avelumab, one from Rare Disease, and four from Biosimilars.","Over the past five years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned to deliver new therapy breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. Similarly, over the past few years, each of our businesses have gained a sharper focus, increased accountability, and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within their unique markets. Today, they have the independence and resources, as standalones and within Pfizer, to effectively compete in their markets while having the benefit of the operational strength and financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer. For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as five therapeutics-focused integrated businesses plus Consumer Health. We think of them as five small biotech companies, each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient groups and having a clear focus on delivering value to patients and return to shareholders.","In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investments in key growth areas that address the unmet needs of patients, and thirdly the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both businesses to be leaders in their markets.","Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on results for the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.","As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior-year periods include only one month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations. In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 include three months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial. Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 reflect three business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial.","Now moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues and our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%.","Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S.; Eliquis globally; and Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix, all primarily in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed U.S. markets due to biosimilar competition, and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter.","Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10%, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and to lesser extent from Pfizer's standalone sterile injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and the associated generic competition primarily for Lyrica and Zyvox in most developed Europe markets. Pfizer's standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations, declined 5% operationally as a result of a 7% operational increase in the standalone sterile injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE products portfolio and the 4% operational decline from the Essential Health standalone legacy established products portfolio.","It's important to note that in emerging markets Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally, due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer's standalone sterile injectables portfolio and standalone legacy established products portfolio.","Third-quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared with $0.34 in the year-ago quarter, due to a charge related to the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity, and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth from certain new, in-line, and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related costs.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16% which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange, and continuing product losses of exclusivity.","I want to point out that third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year over year from 17.4% to 22.7%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. Although we have experienced this for two consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original range.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $115 million or 2% of our total adjusted cost. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela.","As you can see on the chart, we've narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range, and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela. I also want to remind everyone that, as we previously communicated, there are seven fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015.","Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48. It's important to note that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range was negatively impacted solely to reflect this decision. Excluding this boco decision, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02.","Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles such as Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first nine months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank and Ian. And at this point, operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I'd start perhaps for John \u2013 a two-parter for John. First on biosimilar Remicade, how would you set expectations on the launch in light of rebates and aggressive contracting by J&J? And any legal risk that you see that remains for Pfizer? And separately, on the SIP business, which was very strong in the quarter, were there any temporary factors there that helped that? And then for Ian, following your decision to, for now, not split the company up, can you speak to your comments in the release that you will now move forward with focus on strategic priorities to grow and increase operational efficiency to be more competitive? And sort of what that means? Thanks.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Gregg. So let me take the launch of Inflectra, first of all. We obviously are very excited, very positive, about the opportunities that we have, and that's based on the positive uptake that we've seen in the markets where we've already launched Inflectra. In fact, where biosimilars have launched, we've already seen around about a 26% volume share of branded Remicade switch to biosimilars of infliximab, and so we believe that actually the marketplace on a global basis is really beginning to become more comfortable with the introduction of biosimilars. And so in the United States we obviously are very positive about the opportunities that that represents, and we look forward, as we've already announced, to introducing INFLECTRA towards the end of this year.","In relation to sterile injectables, obviously as you know we're very focused on the combination of the legacy Hospira sterile injectable portfolio along with the branded legacy Pfizer portfolio. The strong performance that we've seen in the sterile injectable business this quarter really is a reflection of the combination of the strengths of both of those portfolios together, both the legacy branded Pfizer portfolio, as well as the legacy generic Hospira sterile injectable portfolio. And I think we're seeing at a customer level that the combination of that much broader offerings to customers really provides us with the breadth of portfolio that our customers value and provides us with a strong operational offering to customers right across the world. So we're very positive about that opportunity and how the business is performing. Thanks for the question, Gregg.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. To your second question, my comment there really reflects that through this process we've now established two very strong teams in both businesses. We've established metrics and comparatives, and these teams are focused on producing strategies that indicate or ensure they're competitive within their comparison group and focused on generating the returns that shareholders require. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Ian. Perhaps you could talk a little bit about pricing in the U.S., specifically on Proposition 61? Most recent polling seems to show that if it were held today, it would pass. The industry's fighting it. Can you describe what you think the impact would be on innovation and pricing? What the difference between what \u2013 state agency pay versus the VA pay for Pfizer drugs? And then, separately, we've spoken a little bit about this, but some have pointed to the supply chain, specifically PBMs, as being part of the problem in lack of transparency. Do you agree? And do you think if the U.S. is willing to discuss price controls it should be willing to discuss PBM rebate controls? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So let me take that. This is going to take a little bit longer given the extent of your questions on this. Let's just deal in general with the pricing situation, and then we'll come back to the -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","The PBMs.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","\u2013 the Prop 61. So look, obviously drug pricing affordability is an issue that is concerning to us and has clearly been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidates' positions on these issues, and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing that this debate on pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger; that is the benefits and value added by the pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand the healthcare costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion among some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these rising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail.","So currently in the U.S., just to use a comparator, we spend 17% of our GDP on healthcare, yet we only spend 2% on drugs. About 12% of GDP was spent on inpatient and outpatient services. When we compare that to the OECD countries who spend approximately 9% of GDP on healthcare, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs and only 5.5% of GDP on medical services. Over a half a point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States, you get a vibrant, research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. Further, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004 to 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While faster than the CPI, they are lagging the overall medical costs of around 40% growth.","I think what's exacerbated the cost problem for patients is their insurance plans on average cover a much lower share, 83% actually of prescription drug costs, compared to the cost of medical services, where they cover 96%. So we're seeing insurance companies are making a choice as to subsidizing health services more than drugs. You see this in their actions taken, by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with patients on affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases, because in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry took about a 2.8% on average net price increase. I think the market is reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are two markets. There's a market of branded, patented-protected products, which increased prices in 2015 2.8, then a market of difficult-to-make generics, or generic that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actors take what society believes is unreasonable price increases.","So I think we can have better solutions if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers, and ease the pathway of the generics. Regardless of the election results, I'm not really concerned \u2013 well, no matter the outcome of the presidential and congressional races, we will continue to work with public officials.","That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they're now becoming less helpful in getting cost-effective solutions to patients. In reality, if we could find some way \u2013 and I think it would need a legislative fix \u2013 if we could find some way of ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volumes sold to the constant customers without rebates, I think that would be the best interest of patients.","Now coming to the issue on Prop 61, if we voted today on the facts of the case and the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the California voters. We don't see any particular overall benefit in healthcare costs for California. However, we are in a highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what will happen on this proposition, but once we know the results, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses.","I would like to say that what Prop 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given non-commercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason \u2013 they are a special part of our society, and we've given non-commercial prices to that part of society, to take that and extend it to the rest of government is not a workable economic model. So Prop 61, between its voting and its implementation in six months, I would expect to see a lot of public policy discussions between that time and its implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a couple. On the bococizumab discontinuation, obviously this could have been a large commercial investment, which now you'll save. Ian, can you put this in the context of Pfizer's strategy in primary care? And what influence, if any, would this have on your appetite for bolt-on type of deals? And then, on the pipeline for Xtandi, now that you guys have TERRAIN formally in the label, how much of a tipping point do you think this could be for urologist adoption? I'm just thinking about the bigger M0 population as you move upstream? Thanks, guys.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Look, on the bococizumab, I don't initially have \u2013 it doesn't have that dramatic implications. Its contribution to our EPS was modeled by most analysts as being moderate in the outer years. So, per se, it's not an issue that creates a sudden need to change strategies. It certainly does indicate that we need to continue to make our decisions on portfolio based on what we believe will generate return, and we need to look at the substrate we had in cardiovascular to review \u2013 to see how we strengthen our cardiovascular presence with more substrate. I'll pass it over to -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Xtandi.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","\u2013 Albert to do the Xtandi. Thank you.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you, Geoff, for the question. And for Xtandi going forward, we believe there will be continued momentum in the oncology segment. But importantly, as you asked, we believe there is a large untapped opportunity within the urology segment, which we believe will be capitalized by the TERRAIN label update.","Just some facts: In Q3, 26% of Xtandi units were prescribed by urologists, up from 20% historically. Right now, we have approximately 2,000 urologists prescribing the program. And recent market research suggests that 80% of urologists are highly compelled to prescribe Xtandi after seeing the TERRAIN data. So I think TERRAIN data publication and the inclusion in the label will be an important catalyst for Xtandi.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I have a couple questions. First, Ian, just on your decision to discontinue your PCSK9, it sounds to me like the only thing that has really changed is the emerging profile of your specific drug. The evolving landscape hasn't evolved yet, because we don't yet have clinical outcomes trials, for which we are waiting. I'm just wondering if you saw something with your outcomes trials that you can share with us, and any additional details on LGL lowering and events?","And then my second question is back to the pricing question. Clearly, Pfizer, along with many of your peers, have taken multiple price increases during the year; Pfizer is no exception. How do you see your ability to take price going forward? How should we think about contribution from price going forward? And also, if you could just break out what was price versus volume this quarter? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On the LDL, on the bococizumab, we're making decision based on the profile of our drug, not on the profiles of other drugs. And, on our profile, what we saw was that earlier on we did see we had (39:39) but we had data earlier on at 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and we saw no substantial impact on LDL lowering. In fact we continue to see a robust LDL lowering. It was only recently that we got the data on the majority of our LDL trials out at 52 weeks, and out at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering, and we correlated that with neutralizing antibodies. And then we had the injection-site reaction on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe that it can be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market.","And then on the -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Pricing.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On the pricing issue, we've always priced responsibly. We've priced to the marketplace the value of our product, and on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there's any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Great, next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you; I have three. On Prevnar 13 year to date, the franchise is down modestly, in part due to the Q3 government purchases. To hit the full-year guidance of comparable to slightly down, it implies Q4 will also be slightly down. Is that how to look at it? That does seem better than the cautionary commentary that the company provided, particularly that in August. Secondly, now that Pfizer's had a chance to see Novartis's CDK 4\/6 inhibitor data, how would you compare and contrast the profile to that of palbo? And then lastly, the CTLA-4 from OncoImmune is described in the press release as potentially differentiated. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on its potential differentiation. Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Steve. I'll ask Albert to answer the Prevnar question, and then Mikael will hand the evolving profile of competitive products and our evolving profile, and also the CTLA-4 question. Thank you.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thank you, Ian. Look, the statement is exactly the same as we did it last time. We already expect the total for the year of Prevnar franchise revenues to be slightly down compared to 2015. As we said, we were down 2% operationally; that was driven primarily by the adult indication, which as expected was down approximately 26% in the U.S. Notably, the quarter sequentially grew 37% versus second quarter, because we're entering a high flu season. And in the international markets \u2013 ending the year in aggregate, excuse me \u2013 in the third quarter we were up 21%, but this was driven by the volatility we see in this case, as CDC orders were much higher in this quarter.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, we are very excited and appreciative on the Ibrance profile. It's been taken up extremely well by patients and physicians. It's viewed as an effective, really well-tolerated therapy, and has had a profile for bones and metastatic breast cancer patients that has been great. And we see the profile being very suitable for also early breast cancer and many other indications. Now, we tend to not comment on other products, and as you know, it's difficult to compare across trials, but in contrast to other products, we have not seen issues with elevated liver tests, no issues with cardiovascular or Q2C (44:00), nor issues with GI. Our products has been really well-behaving, and we think its profile works across the breast cancer segment as well as in many other indications.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. The next question please, operator.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","CTLA-4 question, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","On the CTLA-4 -","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Differentiation.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so when it comes to CTLA-4, our view \u2013 referring to -?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","I think it's referring to potential licensing opportunity that we have.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Ah, okay. Well, thank you for that. As you know, the CTLA-4 agents are quite powerful but have been limited by quite some systemic adverse events, and we do look at having the most comprehensive I-O combination portfolio in the industry. And, as you know, we're quite excited by some of our existing assets, like 4-1BB, as a great partner to PD-1\/L1 or OX40, either one. All of these are advancing in our portfolio. We do obviously assess the CTLA-4 class, but the type of drugs we're looking at would be CTLA-4 variants that would have some best-in-class properties that would retain efficacy but attenuate the adverse event profile seen. Those are the ones we're looking at, evaluating, and that would fit with our view of immuno-oncology product to be efficacious but need to demonstrate they're well-tolerated.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First of all, on Enbrel, I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on the market dynamics there for pricing and script switching in markets where you have biosimilars. Second, on Ibrance, I guess the prescription data is beginning to suggest that in the United States at least you may have reached a duration of therapy out there in the market. I wonder if you could maybe give us a bit more color of what duration of therapy looks like in first-, second-, and third-line patients. And then, just in general, sounds like you remain pretty committed on cardiovascular as a therapeutic area. Just how and when will we see you build that out further in terms of developing pipeline assets there? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. I'm going to just take the cardiovascular one first. As we sit here today, we have good assets in cardiovascular. We think it's an important area, and we'll continue to look for ways of strengthening our position there to ensure that we can be players in cardiovascular. Of course, like all of our therapeutic areas, we review these on an annual basis and make decisions on where we want to go and how much we want to invest. And none of this will be an exception this year, when we'll once again look at our long-term strategies in all of our therapy areas.","I'm going to ask Albert to answer the Enbrel and Ibrance question. But I'd just like to point out with Ibrance in the marketplace, we're very pleased with the reaction from patients and physicians for the treatment of Ibrance and its relatively benign side effect profile. Go ahead.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian, and thank you, Jeff, for the question. The third quarter revenues for Enbrel were down 12%, and this decline reflects the negative impact from biosimilars in Europe that will launch later in Q1. We have been preparing for biosimilar competition for quite some time, and we plan to continue to differentiate Enbrel by generating new data, by enhancing the patient experience, and of course by leveraging our expertise in inflammation. For the remainder of the year, we expect to continue modest uptake of etanercept biosimilars, but due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients as physicians look to gain experience with these programs.","On your question on price, so far of the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or Denmark, where Benepali won national tenders, let me say Norwegians publish the outcome of their tender, and the Benepali won the tender with a 47% discount, while Enbrel have provided a 41% discount, but it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative by any means of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe.","Now let me speak about Ibrance. Ibrance had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch has been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of Grade 3 or 4 GI side effects, such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now, as expected given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that. Recent reporting changes at IMS due to some specialty pharma consolidations might be marring the reports and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continued to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016 sequentially, which aligns with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter after quarter.","Now, moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is the following: So far growth of Ibrance has come from establishing the product to early-adopting physicians. We believe growth in the next three years in the U.S. will come from late adopters that have limited prescriptions so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy in building a dedicated sales team and field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our phase 3 PALOMA-2 study data, which we anticipate to occur by year-end, will be important additional data for these late-adopting physicians. Now, outside U.S., additional growth will come from our geographical expansion. As you know, Ibrance is already in the U.S. and now in 20 more countries, and we have received positive opinion from CHMP in Europe and expect registration later this year. And, last but not least, in the midterm, the growth will come from the many studies currently running to move to earlier lines of breast cancer.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Scotti from Evercore ISI.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe initially for Ian, so I wanted to ask a corporate strategy question. Just \u2013 I wanted to get your sense on appetite potentially for other actions, from a corporate strategy perspective in addition to M&A, given that you decided not to split, et cetera. So things like spinouts of business units such as consumer, shock-and-awe buyback, and then of course also any color on the M&A environment right now. Are you still in the market for a transformative deal? And what are your therapeutic categories of interest? And then finally on I-O, I wanted to ask what your thoughts are on the probability of success of your study in the first-line PD-L1 positive setting for avelumab reading out next year. Do you have the ability to change the PD-1 cutoff? And then based on your current thoughts on how the market will play out, do you intend to move I-OI-O combos or chemo combos into phase 3? And when should we expect those registrational trials to start? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. So on the corporate strategy issue around the use of our cash flows, we've always had a combination of use of cash flows between buybacks, dividends, investment in our portfolio, and that has \u2013 also business development. And that combination is what we continue to try to maximize. So I would say today on the business development part of it, our appetite for continued acquisitions or investments in business development remains firm, that if it can improve the return to shareholders, we would act on it. And I don't believe that we're limited in the size of the deal we could do.","That being said, clearly if you do it in therapeutic areas you're already well-established, you tend to get more value, because you get the value of the synergies in that area. So you tend to be looking to do deals in the areas where you're already strong. Secondly, I do think that the whole industry is on pause right now in major business development while we wait to see the consequences abroad \u2013 primarily I would suggest tax policy \u2013 on the results of the elections. Thank you.","I'll pass it over to Albert to do the other questions. Mikael, sorry. I apologize. Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. So I think the way we approach clinical trials is always to be agile and adapt to new information. And clearly we have taken notice about the impact of high PD-L1 for response in first-line lung cancer, and we are reviewing how to best execute the design of our trial. And you can be certain that we will incorporate the most appropriate design to maximize likelihood of success. And certainly we are encouraged that our drug and the class will do well in PD-L1 high lung cancers.","Now, when it comes to opportunity to advance the class further, I really appreciated your question because I think in 2017 and 2018 you will see Pfizer propel as among the leaders when it comes to combination therapies. We aspire to have up to six triple therapies in the clinic by 2018 and up to four of them in the clinic by the end of this year. And that will include triple I-O agents such as 4-1BB, avelumab and OX-40. And it will include doublets and triplets with chemo and I-O agents. It will include also combinations with other emerging drugs in our pipeline, whether targeted drugs as well as combination drugs such as antibody drug conjugate, small molecules like IDO, and I think what you will see is across many solid tumors, some of the larger tumor cases \u2013 lung, ovarian, and gastric, as well as in blood cancers \u2013 a large set of trials that will be doublets and triplets and will address the need to further augment the promising results of immune-oncology, as well as deal with the colder tumors that are lower in PD-L1.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. I would like to add to that the commercial importances that we have all of those agents in-house and will enable a more efficient and focused relationship with the payers.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael and Ian. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First question for you, Ian. It's been bantered about that there could be a repatriation bill. If there was one, what would the dynamics of that repatriation bill need to look like for you to consider repatriating some of the $80 billion that you have trapped offshore that you might potentially like to bring back to the States to put to use? Second question on pricing. I don't think \u2013 you answered Jami's question on price-volume and the contribution there, but just delving on pricing a little further, certainly McKesson and Cardinal have indicated that they expect significantly less price increases next year. Is your innovation product group and your established health group anticipating a similar level of increases to what they took in 2016, or less of increases, as been evidenced by what McKesson and Cardinal have said? And then lastly on Xeljanz, just any update on the European review on Xeljanz and the timing for potentially supplementing that with ulcerative colitis and the psoriasis data? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. So, Albert, could you deal with the Xeljanz question first, please?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, of course. Let me say first of all that Xeljanz completed robust growth, and this growth is primarily due to increasing confidence as a monotherapy agent and inclusion of Xeljanz in the ACR guidelines, introductions of Xeljanz XR, and growing brand awareness among patients.","Now, to your question. We are expanding Xeljanz both geographically and therapeutically. And geographically we are moving it to Europe. As you're aware, in March the EMA accepted our application for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA. The application provides additional information to the original submission. It includes data from the oral development program, which consisted of six completed phase 3 clinical trials, plus two open-label long-term extension studies, one of which is still ongoing. While we cannot speculate what will be European authority's decision, we are very confident on the strength of the data, and discussions are going very, very well.","On the UC and psoriatic arthritis, we are continuing the development of those two indications. They represent high unmet medical need; as a result, high potential, commercial potential. And we plan to file in 2017, as Ian said.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Frank, do you have the numbers on pricing?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. So, as you mentioned before, Ian, we have been, we are, we expect to continue to be responsible players when it comes to pricing. In terms of the absolute numbers, if you look historically, on a total company basis enterprise-wide, our pricing impact in any given year is plus or minus a range of low single digits. And that's what we're seeing again this year on the plus side, a low single-digit increase. And that's what we've seen historically; that's what we're seeing again this year. And obviously for 2017 \u2013 John asked about 2017. When we provide our 2017 guidance in January, we'll also talk about any major assumptions relative to pricing.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and, John, as I said before on pricing, we're going to continue to use the philosophy we've always used, which is to look at the value of our products, look at it in context of the marketplace, handle affordability outside of insurance by our programs that allow people without insurance or poor insurance to get it for free from Pfizer. And so I don't expect, at this moment in time, that there's going to be any dramatic change in Pfizer's policies there.","Now, on repatriation, I would hope that Congress, with the administration, will reform the international tax code as soon as possible next year. I think it is entirely uncompetitive and negative for businesses and jobs in the United States. So I would hope they would reform it in terms of not only repatriation, but going to a territorial system or another type of system that permanently puts us on a level playing field with foreign companies. And I can't really speculate on how they're going to do it or the exact mechanisms, but we would evaluate the law they pass, and we'd make the appropriate decisions when we see what they're proposing. Thank you, John.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Oh, hi. Thanks. Two quick questions if that's okay. Could Frank just run through if there are any specific FX moves that are driving the higher COGS in the third quarter? And then just a question on biosimilars for John. Do you think the branded injectable industry is as complacent now as the branded pill industry was in the first half of the last decade? Thanks.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So I'll answer the FX question first, which is there's really two things driving the impact on, I'll call it gross margin. I was going to use cost of sales, it's easier to do FX. One is FX negatively impacted revenues by $224 million or 2%. It also negatively impacted COGS by $189 million. Now, typically FX, it operates like an ocean tide. Everything rises, everything falls in the same direction, but we had an atypical move this quarter. We actually had it last quarter too, very unusual, where revenues were down, COGS were up. So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7% becomes 20.9%. So FX had a material negative impact overall on cost of sales.","By the way, this kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, we don't expect it to continue in 2017. We do expect it to continue next quarter, and it's really being driven primarily by Japan, and within Japan obviously the yen, based on just what's gone on there relative to the currency fluctuations of the yen and the amount of in-market inventory that we have there. But net-net, 22.7% becomes 20.9% for the quarter.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","So, Richard, thanks for the question. I certainly wouldn't characterize the industry or specific companies as complacent, but I think we would always say obviously the lifeblood of any company is its ability to innovate. But where there are important treatments that are coming towards the end of their period of patent protection, we as you obviously know, are very positive about the opportunities that biosimilars represent to be able to bring treatment options to patients that actually can add real value to the healthcare system. And so we are very focused on what we can do to bring that value to healthcare systems and patients and physicians in the U.S. and around the world.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and I don't accept the comparison to small molecules to sterile injectables. Sterile injectables is an incredibly complex process, needs high capital, needs constant focus on quality. The FDA is very active in ensuring that they meet those qualities, so I really don't think that the risk and the return on capital in sterile injectables can be compared to the small-molecule business.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. The first, coming back to Ibrance, is there any numbers you can put around how large the opportunity is for this next cohort of physicians that you're planning on targeting post the PALOMA-2 publication? I guess just what percent of the market does that represent, or percent of physicians does that represent? And the second was, just staying on Ibrance as well, when we think about the EU opportunity for the drug, how should we think about both the launch and size of that opportunity relative to what we've seen in the U.S.? I guess how would you compare and contrast the uptake we've seen here versus what you hope to see as we roll out in Europe?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. I will try to give you my personal observations. We do have very high penetration among target physicians in the U.S. So many of them, in the range of 80% are prescribing, but the issue is that the vast majority of them are prescribing one to three prescriptions so far. So they are just testing the waters of the program, and this is where the opportunity is coming, and this is why we have developed a specialty force, and this is why I think that the publication of PALOMA-2 data will capitalize this.","In terms of the EU markets, look, I cannot obviously give you a forward-looking statement on our progress, but we aim for leadership with Ibrance there, and we think that we have very robust plans which have built our sales forces. We are expecting the approval now. We have one of the most comprehensive compassionate-use products that Pfizer's ever launched. We have more than 1,000 patients on Ibrance, and we are looking to the future with a lot of optimism.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So I'd just add to that, your question on the EU and the U.S., and the only sort of thing I could say to you is if you look at our experience with Sutent or perhaps the industry's experience, you normally see that the European markets, once you have the investment, can be as robust as the U.S. market in specialty high-value drugs.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks very much for the question. So just a couple here. First off, can you guys talk a little bit about the scale in the consumer business as it sits today and your interest in expanding and building out those assets, as well as the argument for its fit inside the Innovative business rather than the GEP business. The second question is, just excluding product-specific issues, if you were looking at the PCSK9 market and the class with fresh eyes today, given your comments about the market itself, would you still view this as an attractive area for new investment for Pfizer? And then the last question is, as we look at and consider the market opportunity and your considerations in I-O, I would argue that it implies either a unique ability to displace existing players or a larger market opportunity. Can you give us your thoughts on which of the two you see for Pfizer going forward? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on the I-O, they're both opportunities. You're going expand by the combination therapies. Tumors that today we called cold, they don't react, they don't benefit from PD-L1 therapy, and you will also see a replacement ability because we expect to have our efficacy with these combinations and triplets. So I think on the I-O we'll get both of those if we're successful.","On the PCSK9 question, if you ask me would I today begin a new PCSK9 program, the answer is no, we're too far behind.","And on the consumer business, look, it's a valuable business. It's growing well. We're investing. We've made acquisitions. But like all our businesses, we all look at them and we subject them to tests of are they worth more inside or outside of Pfizer? And we'll continue to run those tests. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Just on Ibrance, can you give us the penetration rates for first, second, and third line so we can figure out where we are and how much is more to go? And then, second question, remind us what the next milestone is for the Medivation PARP. And, third, can you give us an update on China and how that's doing in the quarter and year-to-date, what the trends are there? Thanks.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. For Ibrance, the market share, the latest that I saw \u2013 actually I saw them today in my office \u2013 we have approached 50% in first line and 50% in second line of markets there.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Medivation, PARP?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you for asking about the PARP inhibitor. I think it's really a growing drug class, which was fueled by very promising ovarian data that was presented at ESMO, and within that class we are very excited about talazoparib because of its very strong potency and also that it has a potentially unique differentiation with what is called PARP trapping.","When it comes to the near-term opportunities, we have a phase 3 trial called EMBRACA, which is in BRCA-mutated breast cancer that was a readout due next year, possibly middle of the year, and we look forward very much to see that data set, as we think that the talazoparib and the PARP class, for these type of sensitized tumors with DNA-repair deficiency, can perform very well and supplement other therapies.","I wanted to just to punctuate that the existence of this BRCA and other DNA repairs deficiency now goes into a number of cancers and opportunities likely much larger than earlier anticipated. It's not just breast, ovarian, but also increasingly seen in prostate and lung. And these tumors often carry a high mutational burden, which allow us uniquely to combine talazoparib with immuno-oncology products, and of course that can include doublets like avelumab and potentially even triplets. So I think you should really keep an eye on what we may be able to do with our really comprehensive portfolio to move this asset standalone and in combination.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","China. There's more \u2013 the numbers on China. For the quarter, operational revenue growth, 16%, year-to-date operational revenue growth, 10%, and we remain bullish on China. Increasing population, increasing personal wealth, increased government commitment to healthcare spending. Strong GDP, although moderated somewhat. But net-net, doing very well there, and we remain bullish.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","A couple of questions, please. First, going back to the PBMs, which are clearly striving to deliver value for their shareholders. CVS pulled Xtandi and Tasigna, two oral cancer drugs, from their 2017 formulary. Given and following your acquisition of Medivation, plus your existing compounds, the contribution from all cancer drugs in your portfolio is going to be highly significant as we go out five years. Within those categories, there's going to be three CDK 6's, probably five ALKs. Xtandi, as we mentioned, is already gone. I guess what I'm driving at is what you see the risk that PBMs will alight upon oral cancer drugs and therefore the volatilities, given your exposure in that area.","And then, second, on ribociclib, the hepatotoxicity that's been reported with ribociclib. Mikael, you mentioned that yours is behaving very well. There's been case reports of hepatic failure with palbo. What are you seeing more broadly in the real-world practice? Do you think what you're seeing or what Novartis are seeing with ribociclib is due to CDK 6 activity or simply off-target activity of their particular molecule, or are you seeing anything to suggest that may be a mechanism and may in fact impact your molecule as well? Many thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Andrew, on the PBM question, Xtandi was being managed by Medivation, and we probably have more extensive and deeper relationships with the payers than Medivation. So that's one. Two, while I think that PBMs will take a hard look at what we they can achieve, you have to realize that there's a huge emotional content around oncology, and a huge impact on lives saved, value of life, months added. And even in countries like the UK, you've seen them have to react to outrage from the population over lack of access. So I think you'll see a good balance in our society between access and pricing and the efficacy of the drugs.","So with that, I think we've tried the Ibrance question and Medivation, and we go to Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, we're always careful to comment on other company's drugs, but I hear you saying that ribociclib has had reports on cases with liver and also with cardiovascular. And, as you heard from Albert and myself, Ibrance has performed extremely well. It has a very nice tolerability, appreciated by patients and physicians, and we haven't seen these type of issues with our drug. So I'll likely conclude it doesn't seem to be related to CDK 4 and 6, but I'm careful to comment on other companies' drugs.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions. On Xeljanz, can you talk about the U.S. reimbursement outlook heading into 2017? It's a crowded category, lots of moving parts in that marketplace. Second question on PBM, kind of going back to the very first question you got but asked differently, do you think that there's going to be a material change in the relationship between pharma companies and PBMs going forward over, let's say, the next three years? Whether it's a good relationship or not, do you foresee that there's actually going to be material change? And then just a last quick question on CTLA-4 again. And I know it's preclinical, but did you did call out differentiation. You're not in humans yet. I'm wondering what gives you the basis to think that that might actually have a differentiated clinical profile?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Xeljanz. Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. The current growth of Xeljanz \u2013 which is very impressive, 86% \u2013 is driven primarily by the increasing confidence of Xeljanz as monotherapy, inclusion in the ACL guidelines, the recent introduction of Xeljanz XR, and growing brand adherence among patients. All of these reasons, plus our extensive relations with payers, are driving to us having increasing access. And right now we think that the access is going to be much higher in 2017 than it is in 2016.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On PBMs, I mean, we work with PBMs. They have played up to date a role in improving access and reducing cost to patients. I think the issue of the size of the rebates and the net pricing and the general focus on getting pricing transparency could have a marked change, but it would require legislative change. I don't think accident ledgers have changed. I think the market will be stable around the PBMs. It just depends what happens when the new administration and Congress is in and how much they want to get rid of this issue of having high gross prices and low net prices, which I think today we would say is a disservice to patients, especially those that are not insured or poorly insured. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, no, I really appreciate, Tim, your interest in how we try to build an industry-leading combination portfolio. And, as you know already now, we have up to 10 different immuno-oncology product. And as I stated, we will have six triplets by 2018, multiple doublets in 2017, and four triplets. Among the many opportunities, given that we think there are ample potential to expand I-O beyond what we see with single therapies, we do evaluate \u2013 and the CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies that you came back to. And I tried to stay at the high level, because I don't want to in detail reveal what type of approaches we are considering.","But basically we think there are opportunities to potentially see a second generation also in CTLA-2 that will deliver the benefit that you see in the tumor or possibly have a better safety profile, and we do look at CTLA-4's that could have this differentiated profile. As you have noted our agreement with OncoImmune as one example, and there may be several opportunities to tailor a next generation of CTLA-4 antibodies to potentially have such a differentiated profile, so that's why we are eager to further add this to our nice collection of I-O agents. But I have to obviously be careful in not revealing what we think are the unique opportunities that we are assessing. As our portfolio matures, we'll talk more about that.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. David.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to biosimilar Remicade, do you believe that the NOR-SWITCH trial will be relevant at all to U.S. payers or the U.S. medical community? And then second, for Frank, could you just comment on the operational efficiency opportunities that you foresee in the future for Pfizer? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. John.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay, so thanks for the question, David. So obviously we think the increased data on the biosimilars and the utilization in appropriate patient populations is going to be helpful to make sure that patients, that physicians, that payers can gain confidence in how to use them appropriately. NOR-SWITCH is a significant additional add to the data that we have for Inflectra. As you know, it was a randomized double-blind parallel group study with almost 500 patients, and importantly it was funded by the Norwegian government. And the study found no significant difference in disease worsening between patients who underwent a single switch to Inflectra CT-P13 versus those who remained on Remicade. It also found that the incidence of anti-drug antibodies and the frequency of reported adverse events between Remicade and Inflectra CT-P13 were similar. And so we think that the impact of that data is that it certainly will be helpful and informative in helping to make sure that physicians, patients, and indeed payers can make an informed choice about the role that biosimilars and Inflectra specifically can play in that patient population.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","On operational efficiency, Dave, I think \u2013 two comments on this. One, obviously with the two separate businesses we have running within the company, separately we should see separate accountability, really managing their businesses in a very detailed way. We see that as a potential for operational efficiency. And then, just as a company, we're always looking at every dollar, every dollar of capital that we deploy, always with the intent of how do we maximize, how do we optimize the capital that we've spent. So, given that, that's what we meant when we talked about operational efficiency.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. And, operator, if we could please take our last question.","Operator","Your final question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for getting me in. So just two questions following up on topics that came up before. So, one, on your decision to not split, I'm just wondering if you could give any sort of sense around timing for when you may reassess that decision? Is there an ongoing review, or should we not assume anything is going to be looked at again for the next several months or several quarters? And then, second one, on the consumer side, which I know came up a couple times, you mentioned that it's been growing, but looking back at the numbers really it doesn't look like it's grown that much since 2013. So I'm just curious, internally, are there opportunities such as Rx-to-OTC switches or other things that could drive the growth beyond what we've seen over the last two, three years here? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, well, I see growth in consumer. Clearly, it's not a market that grows that much, but I'll ask Albert to talk to that.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","This quarter it grew 2%, but the year-to-date growth is 5%, which is beating the market growth, and we expect to stay there.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So it's a very valuable asset inside our company, and as I said, we look at all of our businesses to continuing tests that they're generating the right return to shareholders. Look, on the split issue, I think we've made a decision. It was a major undertaking to look at it. I don't expect us to revisit that on a quarterly basis, as you suggested. I think it will be reviewed in the context of strategic decisions on a longer timeframe than that.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles Triano","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance, and 2019 financial guidance and business outlook. I'm joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","Slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com\/investors. We'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will speak about our performance for the year, the continued advancement of our pipeline, and the strategy we have put in place to return Pfizer to a period of sustained growth, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE that will negatively impact our growth in both 2019 and 2020. Frank will then provide details regarding the fourth quarter and our 2019 financial guidance.","Pfizer had another solid year in 2018. Revenues for the year were up 2% approximate. We saw continued growth in several of our biggest selling medicines and vaccines in emerging markets and in biosimilars. These increases were partially offset by the $1.7 billion in LOE impacts as well as decreases in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets and in our Sterile Injectables portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.","I will begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another strong year, growing its top-line 6% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several key brands, including: Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally; and Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets.","I would also remind you that Viagra transferred from PIH to PEH at the beginning of 2018. So if you exclude Viagra from the calculation, the growth would have been 9% operationally. For full year 2018, Ibrance revenues were $4.1 billion, which represented an increase of 32% operationally, while approximately 50% of eligible U.S. patients are kept in a CDK inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy.","Many are still receiving endocrine monotherapy or chemotherapy. We continue to educate the oncology community about the benefits of Ibrance therapy. We remain confident in Ibrance's leadership in the class. They're based on the strength of our data, significant first-mover advantage, and most importantly, the continued positive patient experience with more than 100,000 patients prescribed the medicine worldwide since its launch.","Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains outside of the U.S., particularly in developed Europe and Japan. And we had another quarter of solid growth here. Ibrance has achieved reimbursement in the majority of international developed markets, and despite increasing competition has maintained greater than 90% of total CDK class volume in these key markets.","For Xtandi, our alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 18% for the full year. And when combined with our royalty income on ex-U.S. sales totaled nearly $1 billion in 2018. We are continuing to see an increased number of urologists prescribing Xtandi. And our launch of the expanded indication in nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the U.S., following the July approval, made it the first and only FDA approved oral medication for both, nonmetastatic and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.","We continued to see growth in Xtandi throughout this year. And we remain focused on demonstrating the value of moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings. In December, along with our alliance partner, Astellas, we announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint, significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival versus ADT alone.","These data further differentiate Xtandi from the competition, both branded and generic. We are engaging global health authorities in discussions regarding the potential of an expanded indication for Xtandi. And we remain confident that Xtandi will be one of the pillars of our oncology portfolio for years to come.","For this year, Xeljanz had a tremendous performance with revenues increasing 33% operationally to $1.8 billion. Our fourth quarter results continued a pattern of extremely strong performance for Xeljanz with scripts up 35% compared with the prior year quarter. This was driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis prescriptions, as well as increased contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.","We look forward to these new indications becoming even more meaningful contributors in 2019, particularly in ulcerative colitis.","Eliquis had another strong year, with alliance revenue and direct sales growing 35% operationally to $3.4 billion. Lastly, our Consumer Healthcare business grew 3% operationally for the year, with revenues totaling $3.6 billion. In December, we entered into a definitive agreement with GSK, under which we have agreed to create a new consumer healthcare joint venture. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2019, subject of course to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health, while revenues for the year declined, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. Emerging markets revenue for the business grew 11% operationally for the year, to $7.8 billion. Some of the biggest growth drivers in emerging markets were: Lipitor, up 19% operationally; Norvasc, up also 19% operationally; and Sterile Injectables, up 13% operationally.","Our biosimilars business grew 41% operationally in 2018 to approximate [Technical Difficulty]. We received FDA approvals for 2 biosimilars in 2018 and we see the potential for up to 4 additional approvals in 2019. PEH growth in emerging markets in biosimilars was more than offset by lower revenues for our Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets and product supply shortages in the Sterile Injectables business.","In the U.S. Sterile Injectables business, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top-line. We expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019, and continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.","As you are aware, as of the start of our 2019 fiscal year, Pfizer is now organized into three businesses: Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, a science-based innovative medicines business, led by Angela Hwang; Upjohn, an off-patent branded and generic medicines business, headquartered in China and led by Michael Goettler that is bringing 20 of our most iconic brands to more than 100 markets around the world; and our Consumer Healthcare business, led by Chris Slager, which is preparing to become part of the joint venture I mentioned earlier.","Now let me turn my attention to our R&D pipeline. This year we saw a wave of new approvals from our pipeline including four targeted cancer agents over the last four months of 2018. In total, we received seven key approvals in 2018, panning both new molecular entities and line extensions, which will allow us to serve a broader patient population. In terms of the recent news, let me touch on some of the key milestones we have achieved since our third quarter call.","In rare disease, FDA accepted our NDA filings for tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR-cardiomyopathy with a PDUFA date in July. As a reminder, we estimate less than 1% of ATTR-cardiomyopathy patients have been diagnosed. And currently, there are no approved treatments for this disease, making it an incredibly underserved market.","In Oncology, we have several promising developments. We received FDA approvals for Lorbrena, a third-generation ALK inhibitor for lung cancer, and for Daurismo for acute myeloid leukemia. In the Oncology biosimilar space, we received a positive CHMP opinion for Zirabev, a potential biosimilar to Avastin. We have initiated clinical studies for a second cancer vaccine applicable in major solid tumor types, and we advanced a second CDK inhibitor for Ibrance-resistant cancer into clinical studies.","In Vaccines, we've started a Phase 3 trial for our next generation 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults 18 and older. In Inflammation & Immunology, our JAK3 inhibitor for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata started a pivotal Phase 2b\/3 trial.","In Internal Medicine, Pfizer and our partner Eli Lilly announced this morning positive top line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab 2.5 milligram or 5 milligram in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain.","Looking ahead, we see the potential in 2019 for several inflection points that will further advance our pipeline. These include potential U.S. approvals for a combination of Bavencio and Inlyta for first line renal cell carcinoma as well as for up to four biosimilars, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab and adalimumab, which when taken together represent a potential blockbuster opportunity for Pfizer.","We also expect Phase 3 readouts for rivipansel in sickle cell disease and for our JAK1 in atopic dermatitis as well as further Phase 3 readouts for tanezumab, which has the potential to address the serious unmet needs of the more than 27 million Americans living with osteoarthritis and more than 33 million suffering chronic low back pain.","Thanks to these achievements and expected milestones, we believe we are extremely well-positioned, but what we expect to become an era of sustained top line growth with leverage to the bottom line growth rate, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE.","We view this as a significant opportunity, because three very positive trends are intersecting at the same time. First, macro trends such as an aging population and a rising middle class in emerging markets increasing the number of people seeking access to both innovative and established medicines. Second, the continued advancement of what we believe is the best pipeline in our history with good breadth and strong innovation. And finally, after Lyrica, we expect to enjoy the benefits of a dramatic abatement in LOEs until the second half of the next decade.","Our job now is to stay the course, take the steps necessary to pivot to growth. Our strategy for doing so can be summed up in three words: innovating for growth. This means, we must advance both scientific innovation that significantly improves current standards of care and commercial innovation that addresses patient access and affordability issues. Deliver these innovations, we have taken steps to ensure, we have the right organizational structure in place and that our resources are focused in the right areas.","We improve operational effectiveness and create capacity for value creating work. We have reorganized our operations to simplify them. We are initiating an enterprise-wide digital effort to speed up drug development, enhance patient and physician experiences and access and leverage technology in robotics to simplify and automate our processes.","And we are significantly reallocating capital across the enterprise by investing more aggressively in profitable growth drivers and reducing resources in areas of lower strategic importance. This includes significant planned reductions in indirect SI&A spending, much of which will be reallocated to R&D.","And within R&D, the entire increase in spending would be project related with overhead costs actually anticipated to come down. In addition, of course, to all of this, we have the financial flexibility to continue to undertake additional shareholder-friendly capital allocation initiatives. We see a growing dividend as an important part of our investment thesis.","We also have the ability to deploy capital as appropriate in other areas, whether that would be share repurchases or business development initiatives. At the current time, we are focusing on smaller tuck-in type acquisitions and licensing opportunities for mid-stage compounds. Of course, our business isn't without its challenges. Most significantly, we need to ensure that our innovation and risk-taking is rewarded in the marketplace, while doing all we can to ensure affordable access for patients.","At this end, we continue to work with governments, policymakers, payers, and other players in the health care ecosystem to advocate for pro-innovation policies that benefit patients, our company, and our industry as a whole. All the steps we are taking are designed to enable us to achieve our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives.","In summary, we see our improved growth profile and more clearly into focus, and we believe we remain well-positioned to deliver new medicines for patients with further company for accelerated growth in the future and create enhanced shareholder value.","I will now turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2019. Frank?","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. As always the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving onto the financials. Fourth quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $14 billion, which reflects operational growth of $657 million or 5% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, $383 million or 3%.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 10% operational revenue growth in fourth quarter 2018 driven primarily by Ibrance, International Markets, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and Prevnar 13 in the emerging markets, all of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and the resulting shift in reporting of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada to the Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018. And decreased revenues for Enbrel in most developed European markets mainly due to continued biosimilar competition.","Revenues for our Essential Health business in the fourth quarter decreased 3% operationally primarily due to 13% operational decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets driven mainly by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition, a 14% operational decline in the Sterile Injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to increased competition across the portfolio and continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.","And a 10% operational decline in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio in developed markets mainly as a result of expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe and Pristiq. All of which were partially offset by the addition of Viagra revenues from the U.S. and Canada that were previously recorded in the IH business, a 10% operational growth in emerging markets, primarily reflecting growth across the LEP and SIP portfolios in China and operational growth of 31% from Biosimilars in developed marks primarily from Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded $0.07 loss per share compared to earnings per share of $2.02 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the non-recurrence of a $10.7 billion benefit recorded in fourth quarter 2017 to reflect the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.","Higher asset impairment charges primarily associated with generic sterile injectable products acquired in connection with Pfizer's 2015 acquisition of Hospira and higher restructuring implementation cost, partially offset by the non-recurrence of net losses on early retirement of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as higher revenues in fourth quarter of 2018 compared to last year.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.64 versus $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues and lower SI&A expenses. I want to point out, the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 152 million shares versus the year ago quarter due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $383 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $408 million. As a result, foreign exchange had a negligible impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter. You can see on this chart, we've met or exceeded all components of our 2018 financial guidance.","Turning now to our 2019 guidance, I first like to note that our guidance reflects the full year contribution of revenue and expenses from Consumer Healthcare.","Our revenue guidance of $52 billion to $54 billion reflects an anticipated $2.6 billion headwind from products that have recently lost or are expected to lose marketing exclusivity shortly, including LOE for Lyrica in the U.S. in June 2019, as well as an anticipated $900 million negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to actual FX rates from 2018, partially offset by continued strong growth expected from key product franchises including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Xtandi as well as contributions from newly launched products and indications.","Moving on to other elements of our 2019 financial guidance, compared with 2018 actual results, the midpoints of these ranges imply higher adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues resulting primarily from the anticipated LOE of Lyrica in U.S., lower adjusted SI&A expenses, reflecting a 3% to 4% increase in direct spend for product marketing promotion, being offset by a reduction in indirect spend and higher R&D expenses to support our late-stage and emerging early-stage pipelines.","In addition, we anticipate significantly lower adjusted other income this year compared to 2018. As I highlighted on our third quarter earnings call, we expected the core components of other income, net interest income and expense, income from royalties and the ViiV joint venture as well as our pension credit to net to approximately flat or zero.","We have since refined our forecast and are now estimating approximately $100 million of income for 2019. This is approximately $1.2 billion less than 2018 adjusted other income, which included $586 million of net gains on equity investments as well as $464 million of income from collaborations, out-licensing arrangements and the sale of compound rights.","In 2019 and forward, we will exclude gains or losses on equity investments from adjusted results because of their inherent volatility and because we do not believe they reflect the results of our core business. As we report our quarterly results in 2019, the 2018 adjusted results will be presented excluding these gains. While income from collaborations, out-licensing arrangements, and the sale of compound rights will remain in adjusted results, our guidance does not assume any potential future milestone income until it is actually recorded.","We expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 16%, which we believe is sustainable for the foreseeable future. We expect 2019 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.92. As I just mentioned, this range now excludes gains and losses on equity investments, which favorably impacted 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by $0.08. This range also reflects an anticipated $0.06 negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and expected share repurchases of approximately $9 billion in 2019.","Now I want to highlight how our 2019 guidance compares to 2018 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. The midpoint of our 2019 revenue guidance, excluding the anticipated $900 million negative impact from foreign exchange implies flat to a slightly improved operational performance compared to 2018, despite facing an anticipated $2.6 billion of LOE headwinds this year, which is $900 million more than 2018.","On adjusted diluted EPS, the midpoint of our 2019 guidance, excluding the anticipated $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange also implies comparable operational performance compared to 2018 after removing the $0.08 gain on equity investments.","I want to highlight that despite the significant challenges of the Lyrica LOE this year, we expect our 2019 operational performance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS excluding foreign exchange to be comparable with 2018.","Moving onto key takeaways, we delivered strong Q4 2018 financial results with 5% operational revenue growth and 3% adjusted diluted EPS growth compared to year-ago quarter. Our 2019 financial guidance ranges imply comparable operational performance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and 2018 net gains on equity investments despite the anticipated loss of market exclusivity in the U.S. for Lyrica on June 30, 2019.","We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $20.2 billion to shareholders in 2018 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles Triano","Thank you, Frank, and thank you, everybody. Operator, can we please poll for questions now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you very much, and congratulations on a strong 2018 and a solid 2019 outlook. Couple of questions. First, to clarify, has Bavencio plus Inlyta been filed in first-line renal cell? And if yes, was this based on the PFS data? Or was OS met since ESMO? And if only PFS, then how will the regulators view this, given the Keytruda plus Inlyta achieve both PFS and OS? So that's the first question.","Second question is, can you craft an expectation for us for the Tafamidis rollout? Will this be more like a traditional cardiovascular rollout, which can be sluggish, or more like a novel orphan drug filling an unmet need which can be much more rapid? Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Steve. I think maybe John can answer the Bavencio\/Inlyta question.","John Young","Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. So, we obviously only confirm filing when it's formally - a filing is formally been received by the FDA. So all I can say at this point in time is that we're in the filing phase for that study and that indication.","Albert Bourla","Yeah. Thank you, John. And, Angela, maybe you can speak a little bit about the Tafamidis rollout plans.","Angela Hwang","Sure. So we're really excited about the potential launch of Tafamidis for ATTR-cardiomyopathy. We do see this as a rare disease. But it is a severely under-diagnosed rare disease, particularly because there is no treatment today and diagnosis involves the use of invasive heart biopsies. We know that from autopsy data that there are about probably 100,000 potential patients in the U.S., the prevalence of this disease.","But we also know that only about 1% of these patients are diagnosed today in the U.S. So really from a launch perspective, diagnosis is going to be a key focus of our launch plans. And in this regard, diagnosis and market development is a key area for Pfizer. It's a key area of expertise for Pfizer.","Let's just take example, the diagnosis of the ALK mutation for Xalkori in non-small cell lung cancer. At the launch of Xalkori, the diagnosis right here was about 1%. But we know that today it has reached diagnosis rates of 80% to 90%. So we have a strong record of success in developing new markets across not just the ALK example, but many therapeutic areas.","But the one thing we've also learned from this is that it does take time. So our launch is going to be focused on a number of factors, first, in creating suspicion for this disease by both cardiologists as well as patients through education around the symptoms of cardiomyopathy.","In parallel, we also want to increase the utilization of non-invasive scintigraphy versus heart biopsy as a means of diagnosis. We know that there are about 15,000 scintigraphy machines in the U.S. today. And these machines are already being used routinely to diagnose other cardiac diseases. So we know that this is a routine procedure and it is already reimbursed.","So when we look in totality, what we see for Tafamidis is the following. We have excellent data. We have compelling patient benefits. We have deep expertise and commercial footprint in cardiology. We also have a track record of success in creating new markets. And we plan to bring all of this to bear in diagnosing and treating the cardiomyopathy patient.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela. And needless to say that for both Bavencio and Inlyta, and Tafamidis, we are really very excited about the future based on the strength of the data of both studies.","Charles Triano","Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. First, just wanted to - since this has been such a topical thing, your commentary on large M&A, maybe for the broader audience, can you reiterate your thoughts? Would be very curious what your preferences are on large versus mid, and how you define smaller acquisitions in terms of dollars.","Second, just quickly on R&D, on Tafamidis, my question I guess is there wasn't a free acid - or couldn't you have developed a free acid form for 20 milligram also? And I ask because presumably that could have helped with the European pricing structures given your existing 20 milligram approval there.","And finally, Frank, just your thoughts on absolute SG&A and R&D dollar changes in the next 5-year timeframe, just mostly trying to understand your thoughts on operating margin evolution post-Lyrica.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much, Umer. I will recap my thoughts on M&A, and then Mikael can deal with the R&D question about Tafamidis. Look, as we have said consistently, and we started saying that from the second quarter last year and the third quarter last year, and now we are repeating in the fourth quarter earnings call.","Business development is not a strategy. It is a way to execute your strategy. And our strategy has been very clear. Our strategy is to reach top-line growth through the introduction of breakthrough medicines, and we sounded, as I said in my comments, into innovating for growth.","And we believe that right now we are very well positioned to achieve this strategy, because of the combination of, one, virtually LOE-free period after the Lyrica LOE until 2025, the mid of the decade, and also, the introduction of a great pipeline, what we think is the greatest pipeline ever.","So with that in mind, when we have enough time to play, what we need to do is, is to make sure that we maximize the chances of achieving the potential for those new launches are expecting to bring. And this means that execution is extremely important. Right now, execution can make the difference.","And large M&A, it's not that we'll not add right now matching our growth profile, but it could take - derail us from execution, because a large M&A requires thousands of people to work together to just integrate the two companies. That been said, first of all, we never say never, so we are examining all opportunities.","And also, we do plan to deploy capital to enhance our growth profile. It's just that this time, the capital that we plan to deploy has a very different, slightly different direction and focus than before. Before, we were trying to do revenues now or soon. This was more or less the focus of our M&A dogma. And this is exactly what we needed at that time. We were dealing with lack of revenue growth and we needed to bring either pieces that could enhance the strategy to break the company at that time or we could bring revenue streams that will enhance the growth profile that was actually very bad at the time.","Right now, the dogma is changing, and it is how can we bring assets to enhance even further our pipeline to make our growth sustained. And because we have a very strong R&D machine that right now I fully trust their ability to choose assets and also develop them. This is why our strategy is to deploy capital towards this direction.","As I said though, we never say never, and of course, we will never lose our flexibility to deploy capital if we see the opportunities in the best way to achieve our premise. And with that, I will ask Mikael to comment.","Mikael Dolsten","So thank you for your question. We have under breakthrough designation moved Tafamidis registration and the 20 milligram formulation for once-a-day administration was to unused in the clinical studies. And it has priority review and Albert pointed out potential FDA action date in July.","We have also filed a 61-milligram formulation that we think is a very convenient alternative that is under standard review as expected and would potentially be approved in the fall. This would offer patients the very best choices for a therapy that has just really strong dataset and the consistency in cardiomyopathy.","And also I would ask Frank to comment on the question about SI&A and R&D expenses.","Frank D'Amelio","Yeah. So if you think about SI&A, just - we've printed about $14.2 billion in 2018. We guided to $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, so the midpoint is $14 billion, couple of hundred million lower than what we showed in 2018 on actuals. And we actually swung a few hundred million from indirect SI&A to direct our SI&A. So our SI&A, as we're working our way through Lyrica patent cliff. So think about that will take place in 2019, 2020, we remain tough on SI&A.","On R&D, as you look at our R&D, we guided $7.8 billion to $8.3 billion. We spent about $8 billion last year. We'll watch the R&D number, but given how our late stage pipeline, we expect that to grow, we think R&D will continue to grow. Once we get past the Lyrica LOE, beginning at 2021 with 2020 as a base, we expect that top line to grow into mid-single-digit. And we will make sure, we leverage that relative to the bottom line, get operating leverage margin and margin expansion, so that revenues are growing at a rate that's more than the expenses.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much. And I see, Mikael, you want to make a comment?","Mikael Dolsten","I just wanted to make sure since you had this keen formulation interest, Umer, that the 61 milligram free acid formulation is equivalent to the 80 milligram top dose that we used in the clinical trial. So that would be a single tablet as an alternative and potential available latest for pending review. There is no difference in dose. It is just the dosage form.","Albert Bourla","Perfect.","Umer Raffat","Thank you.","Charles Triano","Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. So I just two here. The first was on tanezumab. Can you just talk about the profile that you see emerging from these first two studies, I guess, specifically on RPOA type 2 and this case of osteonecrosis. I just want to understand, you've had some dialogue that you're starting these studies, it's on acceptable levels of these signals. Can you just confirm that what you're seeing so far is below what you think is an acceptable threshold in terms of safety?","And then my second question was about Xtandi and key drivers going forward. And here, I guess, you see the traction you'd hope to see the label expansion and you expect any impact as you think about generic for Zytiga, Eliquis on 2019? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chris. Let's have John start with the tanezumab - answer the tanezumab question and then maybe Mikael can jump in. And then Angela, can you please take the Xtandi question.","John Young","Okay. Thanks for the question, Chris. So let me just sort of context just by saying from a review of the two studies that readout to date, we continue to believe that tanezumab has the potential to offer a new non-opioid treatment for sustained efficacy for moderate-to-severe OA, osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain patients. We're not receiving adequate relief or can tolerate other analgesics and also for cancer pain patients, and those are the patient populations in our pivotal studies.","We also see that tanezumab has the potential to address serious high unmet need for those patients. We estimate that there are around 27 million Americans living with osteoarthritis, 33 million patients living with chronic lower back pain. Many of those patients fail to achieve adequate pain relief despite treatment with various types of pain medications.","Additionally, we also know that the misuse of an addiction to opioids leads to more than 150 deaths every day in the United States. It's estimated that 21% to 29% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them and 8% to 12% develop an opioid use disorder. So we remain encouraged by the emerging and clinical profile for tanezumab although we recognized that many questions still need to be answered.","Last year, we saw a data from one Phase 3 OA study, which was study 1056. That population represented about 10% of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program, which overall includes six Phase 3 studies and around 7,000 patients in osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain and cancer pain. So today's study, we announced earlier on today, we shared top line results from our second Phase 3 OA study, which is 1057. And that population represents another 12% of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program.","So in summary, I would say we continue to see datasets readout. We have more than three quarters of the total number of patients in our Phase 3 program still to readout although the profile unit's emerging and that's to say there are many questions that we still need to answer about the profile of the product. Overall, we remain very positive. Mikael, maybe you can add specific answer to Chris' question.","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you, John. That was a terrific overview of why we are excited about this new emerging potential pain drug class for patient in great need for new opportunities to treat difficult disease. With 1057 study, it was as we have projected and believe to expect RPOA in low-single-digit percent. In 1057, it was just above 2% versus 1056 above 1%. This is the range that we have assumed we'll come out in these trials. And, of course, now thousand patients, we have RPOA at 1.7%.","Within the RPOA, I just wanted to punctuate that the majority of them are of type one, the milder case, with only joint narrowing - joint space narrowing and infrequent symptomatology and only one-third of them about - are tied with more significant radiological changes.","Finally, we had one case of osteonecrosis, which is in line with our expectation that is going to be a rare event. We have now more than thousands patients in osteoarthritis treated with tanezumab, which gives us quite good opportunity to see an emerging drug profile with robust efficacy and as expected adverse event profile that for these patient type seems to me provide really favorable benefit to risk given the alternative treatments are few and would offer a way for us to treat difficult pain, avoiding abuse dependencies such as with opioid.","And let me just conclude and say please remember that the type of patients in 1057 and 56 have been through at least three different classes of analgesics and on average had OA for more than six years, and have reported already with significant impact on their ability to function in everyday life. So for them, it's certainly is an important opportunity to treat their disease.","And let me conclude with remind you that total joint replacement was similar across placebo in tanezumab treated, again, an important finding for us.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much, Mikael. And Angela, key drivers of growth for Xtandi, please?","Angela Hwang","So let me begin by talking a little bit about how well Xtandi did in 2018 and how pleased we are with its performance, but also very optimistic about its future. As you heard Albert say, it is - Xtandi is one of the pillars of our Oncology business. So full year 2018, we grew 18%. Q4 versus Q4 2017, we grew 12%. And then if you include royalty revenues, Xtandi actually achieved over $1 billion in 2018.","But when we step back and take a look at its growth strategy, I would describe it as follows: first, it's our base business in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. This was our first indication. And our growth strategy here has been focused on driving uptake among urologists. And we're really pleased with the progress that we've seen here. Today, more than 30% of our new scripts are written by urologists and we're continuing to see market share growth in this segment.","The second segment and growth segment is the non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer segment, and this is the PROSPER data. And we've seen very positive trends here as well since the launch of PROSPER in July of 2018. Just in 6 months, our market share is quadruple that of Erleada, or if you look at it a different way it is equivalent to the combination of chemo use and Erleada combined.","You may not see it on total sales yet, but that's because the new patients are coming into therapy - new patients are coming every day. So you may not see the full impact of this pool of patients which is still accumulating, so it will take time to realize.","Finally, and the last opportunity, and the one that we're really excited about, is in the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patient population, because this is where the duration of therapy will be the longest. In here, there are two patient segments. The first is based off of our ARCHES data. It's the metastatic hormone-sensitive patient. And there are about 38,000 new patients coming in a year.","As you know, the results of ARCHES were announced in December. And it will be pressed at ASCO in February. We look forward to our discussions with the FDA to potentially support an expanded indication for Xtandi here.","The second segment of growth is going to be in the non-metastatic hormone-sensitive patient. In here, there are about 30,000 new patients a year. This is being studied in the EMBARK trial, which will read out next year. So in totality, we believe that we have excellent data and we also have the potential for new indications. And this will enable Pfizer to make significant impact on patients' lives, but importantly, to change the standard of care for prostate cancer.","You also asked the question on the impact of generic Zytiga. And here, we expect the Zytiga generics to have a minimal impact on our business. Typically, generic impact is greatest with the originator brand. In this instance, Xtandi also has indications that are different from Zytiga. And in addition to that, our dosing frequency is different. We also are - we also don't have the requirement for steroid co-administration and we also have differences in monitoring requirements.","So I think that all of these will stand well in terms of making switching less likely and for the impact on Xtandi to be minimal as we expect.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela. And as I said before for the Bavencio, Inlyta and Tafamidis products, equally excited by Tanezumab and the Xtandi, particularly with the new indications that are coming.","Charles Triano","Thank you, all. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Great. Thank you very much. First on Xeljanz, you obviously have strong momentum there. You have a formidable competitor coming, expected this year. They have a lot of rebates leverage. You have for JAKs coming, TNF biosimilars, TYK2, obviously, a lot of activity in this market, so I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the commercial dynamics in major immunology markets.","And then a follow-up in emerging markets, obviously very strong performance for your legacy products like in cardiovascular disease, Lipitor and so on. I'm just wondering how sustainable is that in your view. Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Yes, on Xeljanz, I will ask Angela to comment. But just to make an initial comment, but Xeljanz already has this year $1.8 billion. So Xeljanz already have crossed the threshold. But it is quite important to be able to be stopped by exclusionary practices that maybe leaders can have in contracting. But I will ask Angela to comment on the growth prospects of Xeljanz in 2019 and beyond.","Angela Hwang","Sure. So first of all, just beginning with 2018, as Albert said, I mean, tremendous growth that we've seen in Xeljanz, 37% growth Q4 over last year Q4, and particularly in the U.S., really strong double-digit growth, about 26%. What we're seeing here in Xeljanz, and I'll start with the U.S. is really the mobilization of all of the indications for Xeljanz. We see strong uptake for Xeljanz in rheumatoid arthritis and really a great experience, and I think in comfort by rheumatologists in prescribing Xeljanz.","So just as an example, about 53% of U.S. patients now are using Xeljanz without Methotrexate as monotherapy, which is just great progress in terms of, I think, demonstrating the confidence that rheumatologists have with Xeljanz.","But what we also saw towards the end of last year was the launches of PsA and UC. And another example here of the growth that we've experienced in terms of the Q4 volume growth, a third of that volume growth came from these two new indications. And just as another example of why we're excited about these new indications, in UC specifically our early data shows that we've also recently surpassed Simponi in terms of new patient market share.","So I think in the U.S., we continue to see a tremendous growth, possible across all of these indications. And as you know, we have other indications that are part of our lifecycle management that we will be continuing to work on.","Globally, we have launched RA, UC, as well as PsA. But what we are in the middle of is gaining reimbursement for these new indications. We're encouraged by recent signs from payers of the acceptance of Xeljanz in these new indications such as the nice approval that we got in 2018 for both UC and the PsA indications.","The net-net when we sort of bring together all of these indications, RA, which is our base business, but now tagging on UC and PsA, we see between both of these two new indications a market that's approximately $10 billion large. And I think over time with reimbursement, but also the increased comfort level and experience that rheumatologists, gastroenterologists will have with prescribing Xeljanz, we expect to see continued and strong growth from this franchise.","I think you asked a question about competitors as well. And certainly this is a class that is hugely competitive. But I think that Pfizer's long experience and I think track record of success in JAK science as well as our deep entrenched commercial footprint in rheumatology and now in gastroenterology will stand us well as we deal with this increased competition.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Thank you, Angela. And I will ask Frank to give us some numbers and comment on emerging markets. Just an initial comment from my side, but emerging markets is and will continue to be a key strength for us and the key pillar of growth, and particularly in the context of the new organization.","Let's not forget that a very big part of the emerging markets business has become part of the Upjohn group. And this was exactly engineered, so that we would be able to maximize the growth and particularly in areas like Asia and particularly China, but they have the biggest potential. But, Frank, why don't you give us some numbers to color the picture?","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So, Alex, emerging markets for the quarter, $3.3 billion in sales for the year, $12.65 billion in sales, each up 13% on an operational basis, strong performance; China for the quarter and the year, more than 20% growth. So you asked what do we expect growing forward. We believe we could continue to grow emerging markets in the low-double-digits on going forward basis.","Albert Bourla","Thank you.","Charles Triano","Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So a couple if I could. So, one, just around 2019 guidance, can you just elaborate a little bit more what you're assuming in terms of net price increases in the U.S. into the guidance? And maybe just with all the discussions on a DC, are there any significant changes that you're assuming may take place in the 2019 timeframe?","And then, just the second one is more on the oncology side. Any update around when we might see some of the adjuvant breast cancer data from Ibrance? I know that's a key part of the next, sort of part of the growth story for that franchise. So maybe you can share anything there.","And then, similarly with Bavencio, we did some work around the immuno-oncology adjuvant opportunity. And then it doesn't look like there's a lot of work being done with Bavencio there. Maybe you can comment on any adjuvant opportunity for that product. Thanks.","Albert Bourla","Right, on 2019 guidance and the pricing I will ask again Frank to run us on the numbers.","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So, Vamil, in terms price, in the U.S. for 2019, we assume net price will be flat and worldwide we're assuming price that's in the negative low-single-digits, so minus low-single-digits and U.S. flat.","Albert Bourla","And I just want to make a comment here that it's very clear, that pricing is not going to be a growth driver for us now and I think in the future. It's very clear. So this is all included in our guidance, and it is also included in our projections for mid-single-digit growth, post the Lyrica LOE for the 5 years. And that will come from breakthrough medicines and based on volume rather than in price increases.","And with that, the Oncology question about Ibrance. Let me pass it to Angela, please.","Angela Hwang","Sure. So we're really excited about the adjuvant opportunity. And as you said, it is the third part of our growth strategy, so very important part of our growth story for Ibrance, but also for Oncology in general. The two studies, PENELOPE-B and PALLAS, all the studies that we are looking forward to. Both of them are going well and have recruited faster than expected. And these studies are important, because they give us the potential to double the number of patients that are eligible for Ibrance. But we have to remember that these studies are event-driven and based on our projections should read out sometime next year. So I think more to come on that as we progress through the clinical trials.","Then I think you had a second question on\u2026","Albert Bourla","Bavencio, I think John maybe you can take it, and then you can add Angela.","Angela Hwang","Okay.","John Young","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Vamil. So we are obviously continuing our effort with the execution of the avelumab development program. It includes 30 ongoing studies, seven of which are potentially registration enabling, involving more than 9,000 patients across 15 tumor types. I think it's always important when we talk about IO to say that we have always recognized believe that the real value of IO is expected to be in effective combinations.","And we believe that solid preclinical science, we are in a good position to be competitive in a number of tumor types, it really underpins our development strategy. One example of that, I think, Albert's already commented on is the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, combined by Bavencio with Inlyta in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma patients. And the combination provides a superior progression survival compared to Sutent.","There are two additional immunotherapy Phase 3 studies ongoing, including axitinib with pembrolizumab in first line renal cell carcinoma, which study is a sponsored by MSD and also enzalutamide, and atezolizumab and CRPC, which is sponsored by Genentech and Roche. But I think, in terms of the wider development program, which is kind of where you're driving, we're currently testing up to 10 Pfizer combinations with checkpoint inhibitors including five targeted Pfizer therapies. We also have a number of studies combining avelumab and talazoparib across the range of indications.","So that really speaks to just the way that we see Bavencio as being potentially valuable therapy in some important areas of high unmet need for patients, where we believe combinations could really advance standard of care.","Albert Bourla","Thank you.","Charles Triano","Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Timothy Anderson","Thank you. I have a few questions. I don't want to put your cart before the horse on this, but 2020 consensus has earnings growth being nearly flat. There are a variety of pushes and pulls. You're launching new products. You have some strong growing inline brands, but you still have Lyrica LOE spilling over into 2020. I'm wondering if you can comment on how you kind of view where consensus sits on the earnings line. Is 2020 likely to be a flattish year as well?","Second question is on this other income deductions line. I'm just wondering why the change in heart and how you account for the impact of unrealized and realized gains and losses. Why different in 2019 versus 2018? Was that at the advice of your accountants or the IRS or someone else?","And then last question on the JAK1 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, and you have a Phase 3 reading out in 2019. Can we assume you'll need two Phase 3s for approval in that indication and would the second one readout if it does require to? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Why - Frank, why don't you deal with the question about the consensus and the OID. And then Mikael can discuss the JAK1 Phase 3 study.","Frank D'Amelio","So first, Tim, on the OID question, that was my decision in terms of taking the gain or loss on equity securities, equity investments out of adjustment income. New accounting was put in place in the beginning of 2018 in terms of realizing or booking gains and unrealized gains into results. The amount of - the size of the gains in 2018 surprised us quite frankly, introduced a lot of volatility into our numbers. So I decided at the beginning of 1\/1\/2019, we will take that out.","By the way, please note, I actually think that if we left it in, that the probability of that being a good guy is much higher than if it were a bad guy to our 2019 results. But I thought the best thing to do was to take it out, because there's introducing a level of volatility that isn't part of our core business. So we removed it for that reason. But we tried to show that on the guidance that we provided to you all in our release at the bottom of Page #2.","Then in terms of the 2020 numbers, I won't comment on consensus, obviously, in terms of our rhythm of the numbers. For job one is we got to deliver on what we've just said in 2019. 2020 we will still have the challenge of the Lyrica LOE. We'll get the full year effect of that in 2020, so we'll have to work our way through that relative to the business. Obviously, we'll do everything we can to work our way through that relative to earnings","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Frank. Mikael, what about JAK1, how many Phase 3 studies we need?","Mikael Dolsten","So I would say like this, we think it's very large opportunity for the JAK1 in atopic dermatitis. And we're very excited about the profile, as you remember, from our Phase 2 studies that this drug class seems to have real rapid activity both in clearing skin eczema and in pruritus itching. We have actually two trials reading out in 2019, one in May and one in September range. Give or take with sometime as these trials can conclude.","And we actually have significant program here to potential establish this as a very significant product, with also trials reading out in 2020 including a comparator trial to [dupixend] [ph] and I think particular area is to look at the rapid onset of JAK versus biologicals. There is a mechanism of action started to provide additional insight and also 52 weeks longer term study. So it's a very comprehensive data package. But please look out for our 2019 data readout that will tell us the initial outcome of this exciting new drug classes.","Albert Bourla","The strength of your profile as it will emerge. Thank you, Mikael.","Charles Triano","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First question, I had was on tanezumab. Do you think the RPOA and the other safety imbalances are a result of the drug or the patient population? And then second question I had was if you could provide any sort of efficacy data with respect to the two arms? Or if you can't, how does it compare to what we saw on the 16-week data?","And then last question I had was just on your leverage as you move past these LOEs, what kind of leverage can we assume to the bottom line and how much better will it be than what we see now? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Mikael, can you please deal with the tanezumab question, please?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. I mean, certainly we know from historical trials that patient with advanced OA are more likely to develop RPOA than patients with chronic lower back pain that in general have healthier joints. That's number one. Number two about tanezumab relationship to this, I think we will get a better understanding as we see this year, the comparator trial with NSAIDs for OA and with opioids in chronic lower back pain. That will allow us to understand the incidence of RPOA on different treatment.","But please let me just underline, each drug class has its profile. And of course opioid, as you know, which is the major comparator for us in chronic lower back pain are associated with a range of very difficult side effects including fatal outcome for tens of thousands of Americans every year, very different from low-single-digit orthopedic injury that we have discussed.","And let me even remind you that NSAIDs, which in general has been not a very effective on advanced OA or of course associated with gastro intestinal risks of bleeding and also been associated with cardiovascular risk.","So overall, we think that tanezumab represents a new emerging drug class with a very interesting efficacy and we will learn more about exact tolerability safety profile later this year, but we remain a very positive about this offering for patient pending of course finalization of studies and potential regulatory process.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, thank you, Mikael. And as regards to the leverage to the bottom line, let me ask the master of levers, Frank D'Amelio, to comment.","Frank D'Amelio","So Louise, here's how I think about this and to kind of connect back to Tim's question. We need to work our way through 2019. We need to work our way through 2020, work our way through the Lyrica LOE and the major impact of the Lyrica LOE in those two periods. We get to 2021, LOEs decline materially. Our pipelines kicking in, our online products are kicking in, our emerging markets are continuing to grow. That's where we see this inflection point in terms of the rhythm of the business, the rhythm of the numbers. We think we can grow that top line mid-single-digits, so approximately 5%.","We think, clearly, we can grow the top line, when we grow the top line mid-single-digits, we can clearly grow the bottom line more than mid-single-digits. Hopefully our actions over the years have demonstrated our ability to do that. So that's how I think about this in terms of rhythm of the business.","Albert Bourla","Well said, Frank.","Charles Triano","Thanks, everybody. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. Just to follow up on 2020. So obviously the patent expiration of Lyrica annualizes in June of 2020. So do you think that Pfizer can return to revenue growth in the second half of 2020 after that annualizes, Frank? Or are there other factors that would preclude a return to growth in that second half period?","And then with respect to Ibrance, I was just hoping for some perspective on what we should expect for U.S. sales in 2019 relative to 2018. Obviously sales have been flattening out according to the IMS data, but should we be expecting U.S. sales to be flat in 2019 versus 2018 or could they be down slightly due to competition gaining share? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. And obviously, we do not provide guidance for the year after and also we do not comment - provide guidance on individual products, particularly on an individual region of an individual product. But I will ask Frank to give some color on the 2020 and what happens after the second quarter, and then of course Angela to give at least the dynamics of the market.","Frank D'Amelio","So Dave, I'll do my best to try to answer this, but to Albert's point, trying to provide 2020 guidance and breaking it down into quarters and halves is extremely difficult. What I would say is this; there will still be material LOE impacts from Lyrica in 2020. So we still view 2020 as a challenging year. I think the real pivot point, the real inflection point become 2021 using 2020 as the base year. That's where I think we can really show some major league progress on the top line and then dropping that to the bottom.","Albert Bourla","I'm going into quarter after quarter, of course, just to something that we don't want to speculate now. And Angela?","Angela Hwang","So I think as we think about Ibrance in the U.S., certainly we have been very pleased with the performance of Ibrance to date. I mean, just really strong growth quarter-over-quarter or even full year over full year. But the way we look at it in the three phases of growth is how we think about its growth prospects. So Phase 1 is this U.S. launch in metastatic breast cancer, which includes our growth of the CDK class as well as our own leadership of that class.","And in this regard, being that we had such rapid uptick initially, we have now reached a 50% class share, which we are very pleased with, though we know that this is the point that we will need to continue to expand on in order to generate further growth. But certainly, the fact that we've been able to treat 95,000 patients in the U.S. with metastatic breast cancer is very positive for us.","And then the other phase of our growth is our international launches, which really began in 2018. And here we've exceeded our expectations as well. We have treated more than 85,000 patients' ex-U.S. through the launches in Japan, in the EU, in China and Brazil towards the end of last year. So I think in 2019, that's going to be another focus area of growth for us.","And then Phase 3, we talked about already a little bit earlier which is our adjuvant population, which is coming up. But maybe just sort of coming back to the U.S. and specifically where the growth is coming from, we do see the class growth at 50% as one that - as one where, additional opportunities can be found. And I think that what we are now focused on is breaking the entrenchment with the single agent endocrine therapy, which will then allow us to grow the CDK class.","But we also clear about what it is that we need to do here. So just as an example, we know that 25% of our key accounts have more than 40% share in the single agent endocrine therapy. So we're really focused on targeting our HCP education very carefully in this area. We also know that educating a newly diagnosed HR positive, HER2 negative patients about the significant clinical benefits of adding Ibrance in first line therapy is an important aspect of our work.","And here we know that the data show that in the first line setting, when you add Ibrance to endocrine therapy, you achieved a longer progression free survival of about 12 months. So we think that this is really important information for patients to have.","So when you look at the totality of our data, our access, our strong leadership position, but also the strategy that we have, we believe that we can really make a difference from a patient impact perspective, and we see great potential for growth for Ibrance.","Albert Bourla","Thank you.","Charles Triano","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Gerberry","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess just - I'm not sure that you'll be able to answer this, but just on tanezumab. Was there any sort of dose response with respect to the RPOA rates? I believe in the prior study at ACR, there was a bit of a dose-related response. So I was just curious to what extent you can comment on that. And then also just with the RPOA, did - I know, there was an additional dose that was provided in this trial versus prior trials, so just sort of curious if the inclusion of an additional dose if events were skewed early or late in the treatment period?","And then one housekeeping item, do you expect to be in the market for Rituxan, at time of market formation, which is I think the Street's thinking around mid to second half of 2019. Thanks.","Albert Bourla","Michael, you want to take the tanezumab question?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. Thank you for the interest in the product. And as we've said previously we were very pleased with readout of 1057 and 1056 more than thousand patients with robust efficacy we reported on the 5 milligram across all three primer end point and two of them on 2.5 milligram. We have not seen on these two doses any difference in the tolerability or safety profile and feel that we understand the profile very well. And we're also pleased to report that total joint replacement was similar versus placebo.","So I think that speaks to the strengths of the dataset we have. And we look forward to share data in more details at the upcoming conference and report out additional studies this year.","Albert Bourla","Yes, very nice, interesting tanezumab overview. Angela, about the biosimilar Rituxan?","Angela Hwang","So our plans are on track. And we are planning to launch Rituxan in 2019. And we look forward to receiving the approvals and then planning for our launch.","Charles Triano","Great. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Sorry to ask another one on the 2019-2020 growth profile. But, Albert, is there willingness to be more active on commercial stage M&A, just the change of growth profile until 2021, even divesting lower growth franchises? I'm trying to see how proactive Pfizer will be versus just waiting until after the Lyrica LOE.","And then another one on biosimilars, there's obviously lots of launches coming up, including Rituxan. How will the strategy evolve from a pricing and access perspective? And what are the main lessons you guys have learned so far from Inflectra just of late that can help accelerate the launches? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Angela will answer in a moment the biosimilars question about our - that you asked, pricing and what is our strategy there. But, look, on 2019 and 2020, as I said, we will be proactive. But proactive doesn't mean that our focus it is how to change the profile of 2019. Proactive means how we're going to enhance the growth profile of Pfizer in the pivotal moment of this company after the June-July of 2020 or in 2021 we'll see it as a full year.","So in the commercial space, again, we are looking for opportunities with our - to deploy capital that will help. But the direction right now, it is to enhance our growth profile and not to dilute it. And the direction right now, it is not to disturb operationally the business in this very critical phase that we are trying to get the pipeline through the finish line, prepare the markets commercially, and then launch the products. And this is the focus really. Angela, what about biosimilars?","Angela Hwang","So we are looking forward to the launch of 3 additional oncology biosimilars in our portfolio in 2019. And I think that what we've learned about the biosimilar market is that it is a - we believe in it from a potential perspective and from a growth perspective. What we're also seeing are differences in the EU and in the U.S.","So in the EU, we see a very rapid uptake and actually great acceptance of biosimilars. And if I just use Infliximab molecule as an example, the Infliximab biosimilars are about 65% of the total molecule. And we've seen rapid uptake and great acceptance by customers, by payers. We see a market that I think is evolving and developing in the U.S.","And I think that our experience with Infliximab in the U.S. really is not a great analogy for what might be to come with our new oncology biosimilars, just because they're just very different dynamics in the I&I space compared to the oncology space. The big difference in the I&I space is in the U.S. is the exclusionary contracting from J&J, which is really prevented and been a great impediment to our ability to grow the I&I biosimilar.","Rebates rather than net price has really driven I think formulary access. And that has been a great barrier to our ability to grow. However, we see different dynamics in the oncology space. And that is because oncology drugs are shorter in duration of therapy, so that allows new patients to turn over faster.","And it will make it easier for the physicians to initiate new patient on oncology biosimilars. And we believe that this will enable customers to benefit from the cost savings that they can derive from biosimilars much more quickly than what you might see in the I&I space where the duration of therapy is very long. It's a long chronic disease.","So we are excited about the upcoming launches of our oncology biosimilars and we expect our entire biosimilar portfolio to be a strong contributor to growth to Pfizer in 2019.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela.","Geoff Meacham","Great. Thanks for the insights.","Charles Triano","And we'll take our last question, please, operator.","Operator","Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Hi, thanks very much for the question. So my question really was on tanezumab. I know there's been a lot of questions around the safety side. But the low dose didn't separate from placebo on one of the co-primary endpoints. And just wanted to understand a little bit better how you guys are feeling about the differences in this particular patient population to really give you strong conviction that the assumed benefit of efficacy of this novel mechanism are going to be sustained.","Albert Bourla","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you. First, let me point out that the 5-milligram dose in 1056 and 1057 performed very well, consistent, robust on all three primary endpoint in both of the studies. The 2.5 milligram performed with statistical significance in 1056 on all three primary endpoints. And on the two most important, it was positive pain and physical function.","It was positive on overall assessment of OA at several time point, but narrowly missed at 24-week. Often what happens in this type of trials in pain is that you may have variability in placebo response at various time points that is likely to influence. But please note that numerically we are still pleased with the response to 2.5 milligram at all-time point.","And we think we have 2 doses that offer so far robust, consistent efficacy in a very advanced patient population and we feel that we consistently have reported the tolerability and safety profile. So we look forward to conclude the trials with another osteoarthritis later this spring and a chronic lower back pain. And so far, we are very pleased with tanezumab.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Mikael, and just thank you, everyone, for your great questions. I was very pleased to see that the majority of the focus right now is on our pipeline. And I think you're right. This is where it should be. And we are looking forward for an equally great 2019 as we had in 2018. Chuck?","Charles Triano","Great. Thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning. This will end the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com\/investors.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2017 Annual Report on form 10-K. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's form 8-K, dated today, May 1, 2018.","Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks I will discuss the progress and opportunities we are seeing across the business, as well as the continued strengthening of our R&D pipeline, which we increasingly believe has the potential to drive significant future growth for Pfizer.","In the first quarter, total company revenues declined 2% operationally. This was due primarily to the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, biosimilar competition for Enbrel in Europe, and product supply shortages related to our legacy Hospira products in the U.S. and our production facilities in Puerto Rico. These declines were partially offset by continued strong growth in emerging markets biosimilars globally and many of our anchor brands.","I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 3% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines. The year-over-year growth rate of the Innovative business was negatively impacted by approximately 1 percentage point due to the reclassification of U.S. Viagra sales to the Essential Health business, following its loss of exclusivity at the end of 2017.","In addition, both Ibrance and Xeljanz revenues in the U.S. were impacted by customer buying patterns this quarter. But we expect to remain on track for our full-year outlook for both products.","In the first quarter, global Ibrance revenues were up 35% operationally to $933 million, with non-U.S. revenues almost tripling. Ibrance continues to hold a leadership position in first-line hormone receptive positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Since its launch, approximately 12,000 physicians have been prescribed Ibrance in the U.S. and more than 120,000 patients have been prescribed the medicine worldwide.","The overall CDK class continues to increase penetration within the eligible patient population. And we now see approximately 70% of eligible patients receiving CDK therapy. Within the CDK category, Ibrance again increased its share from 52% last quarter to 56% this quarter.","Xtandi's U.S. alliance revenues were up 21% in the quarter to $159 million. In mid-March, the U.S. FDA granted priority review for the sNDA for Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with a PDUFA date in July 2018.","In the EU, the EMA has validated the Type II variation submission for the same indication and began the new review process on March 5.","Xeljanz revenues increased 29% operationally in the quarter to $326 million. We recently received two important regulatory milestones for Xeljanz. The FDA Advisory Committee recently gave us a favorable outcome for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. And this indication has a PDUFA date in June 2018.","And just last week the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for Xeljanz 5 milligrams twice daily in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. We believe the potential for Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis, for which we've already received an FDA approval in December, and ulcerative colitis, if approved, could be significant.","Global Eliquis revenues were up 30% operationally in the quarter to $765 million. Eliquis is the number one new-to-brand novel oral anti-coagulant prescribed by cardiologists in 21 markets. In the U.S., it has a 52.1% of the total prescription share for novel oral anti-coagulants, 10 percentage points ahead of our primary competitor, Xarelto.","Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our Consumer Healthcare business, which has delivered another solid quarter. We remain disciplined regarding our capital allocation. And at this time, we have not received an acceptable offer for the sale of this business.","We will continue to manage this very strong business as we explore other alternatives, which could include everything from a full or partial separation of the business to ultimately deciding to retain the business. We continue to expect to make a decision during 2018.","I would like to take a moment to thank all of the Consumer Health colleagues who have worked so hard in the last quarter to produce a strong 4% growth rate.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the quarter declined, due in large part to expected product LOEs and ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio.","Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 12% operationally for the quarter to nearly $2 billion. China led the way, growing 26% operationally.","Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 53% operationally in the quarter to $173 million. We expect to broaden our biosimilars portfolio in the U.S. by potentially bringing five biosimilars to the market in the next two years.","Our sterile injectable shortages are primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio. We expect our sterile injectable sales will be roughly flat year on year, and this is incorporated into our financial guidance. We continue with our comprehensive remediation plan to upgrade and modernize these facilities. And we expect additional capacity to be available in 2019.","We continue to strengthen and advance our pipeline, which today is as strong as it's ever been. Let me touch on some of the more promising recent developments.","In Oncology, we have a broad range of targeted compounds that represent potential near-term opportunities. The Phase 3 EMBRACA trial showed that our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, significantly extended progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with BRCA positive metastatic breast cancer. We are discussing the results with worldwide health authorities and anticipate filing this quarter.","Lorlatinib was recently granted priority review by the U.S. FDA as a potential treatment for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a PDUFA date in August of this year.","Dacomitinib received the same designation in April for EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with a PDUFA date in September of this year with the potential to broaden our reach to areas of lung cancer where there is great unmet need.","In I-O, we continue to progress our development program for Bavencio with our partner Merck KGaA. Both in monotherapy in combinations with chemo and targeted Pfizer agents, including Inlyta, in first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma and talazoparib in multiple tumor types.","In Inflammation and Immunology, we have built what we believe is a true leadership position with our JAK franchise. We recently started Phase 3 trials of our once-daily JAK-1 in atopic dermatitis. We currently have 10 ongoing selective immunokinase programs.","In Vaccines, the Phase 3 study for our potential C.diff vaccine, where we have the potential to be first in class, has been enrolling well. Leveraging the success of Prevnar, we are in Phase 2 with our next generation pneumococcal vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes. We expect to see the proof of concept data later in the year and expect to begin Phase 3 in 2019.","We also are currently in Phase 2 with our staphylococcus aureus vaccine. And we are in discussions with the FDA regarding expanding the study to become a Phase 3 pivotal study.","In Rare Diseases, we recently announced a positive Phase 3 study readout for tafamidis for the treatment of TTR cardiomyopathy. And we expect a Phase 3 study readout for rivipansel in sickle cell later in the year.","In Gene Therapy, we recently dosed our first patient using our investigational mini dose dystrophin gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And early data for this trial are expected in the first half of 2019.","And in Internal Medicine, we expect a Phase 3 readout for tanezumab in osteoarthritis later in the year. If positive, this could be the first in a new class of non-opioid treatments for this disease.","Through 2022 we see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters, subject to some expected attrition. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to have a life-changing impact on a growing number of patients, while creating enhanced value for all our stakeholders.","In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well-positioned to deliver new medicines to patients and increase value for our investors going forward. Most of our anchor brands are primed for continuous growth. Our pipeline is as deep and focused as it's ever been. Our ownership culture remains a key differentiator for us. And our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation will ensure we have the resources to invest in future growth opportunities.","Looking ahead, we expect that a dramatic reduction of LOE impacts following the upcoming Lyrica LOE in the U.S. will unencumber the potential revenue growth of our key drivers, including the expected realization of our pipeline, and allow us to achieve an inflection point in our topline growth profile. Coupled with continued strong expense management, we expect this will enable us to continue to drive EPS growth at a rate that exceeds revenue growth.","Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for 2018.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials.","First quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $12.9 billion, which include the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $430 million, partially offset by an operational decline of $302 million.","Our Innovative Health businesses recorded 3% operational revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, driven primarily by Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, which was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition. It's important to note that Viagra revenues generated in the U.S. and Canada, which were previously recorded in the Innovative Health business, are now reported in our Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018.","Revenues for our Essential Health business in the first quarter decreased 9% operationally, primarily due to a 15% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.; a 15% operational decrease from Peri-LOE products, primarily due to the expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe and Pristiq in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S.; 12% operational growth in emerging markets; and 53% operational growth in biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in developed Europe as well as certain channels in the U.S.","I want to point out that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 12% operationally.","First quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.59, compared with $0.51 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCGA (sic) [TCJA] (16:23), in late 2017; and higher other income, due to increased income from collaborations, out licensing arrangements, and sale of product rights; and unrealized net gains on equity securities, reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard the first quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by lower revenues, primarily in our Essential Health business.","First quarter reported diluted EPS was also favorably impacted by fewer shares outstanding. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.77, versus $0.69 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned factors.","I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 35 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2017 and completed in May of 2017, to a lesser extent by shares that were repurchased during first quarter 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share based employee compensation programs.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted first quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $430 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $349 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter.","As you can see, we reaffirmed all components of our full-year 2018 financial guidance.","Moving on to key takeaways. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2018, with a 12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We reaffirmed all components of our 2018 financial guidance. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Ian, this is for you as well as Frank. You've talked about an inflection point in growth post the Lyrica LOE, I think starting after 2019. While I'm not asking you for specific guidance, can you give us a sense for the magnitude of that change? Are you talking about sales going from sort of flattish where they have been for quite some time to sort of mid-single digit growth? And earnings, which have been sort of mid-single digit growth too, where can that go?","And, Frank, assuming you don't do a large transaction, can you still drive bottom line leverage? Ian mentioned that you can. But your margins are already 40%. Can they get to 45% without a large deal?","And then just lastly to you, Ian. Every CEO before you has done a major transaction to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. Just curious, because your messaging has shifted a lot on a quarter-by-quarter basis. What will your legacy be before you retire? I mean at one time you had said you aspired to get back to the innovative core. At other times you've talked about wanting to do a large transaction. So just was wondering if you could kind of share with us what you expect your legacy to be? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for that. Let me first of all address the starting growth question. And then I'll come back to the more mundane facts of legacy.","We continue to believe that the combination of our late-stage pipeline, as you mentioned, the significant tapering of LOEs post the impact of Lyrica, plus the growth drivers of our pipeline, will give us a substantial inflection point, I believe moving our growth rates in revenue to mid-to-high single digits, and obviously our revenue being at least equal to that.","If you look at our Innovative Health growth drivers today, we have Ibrance, Xtandi, Xeljanz, Eliquis. And we're participating so those products can continue to conform well, They have significant patent lives, and they have a significant extension of data readouts coming on those products.","Our Essential Health business will expect to be growing at that period, having passed through the major impacts of the LOEs. We have our emerging market business, we have our biosimilars business, and plus we have our sterile injectables business, which we think will put past us any of the issues of manufacturing from the Hospira plants.","So all in all, I am really looking forward to the growth rates that we will produce. And if you look over the four years, we have projected the potential for approximately 20 to 30 approvals, of which 15 have the potential to be blockbusters. I think we put out a list of those products. I mean I don't want to extend the answer too far, but it is an exciting list.","We have in Vaccines, Clostridium difficile; we have Staph aureus; we have pneumococcal next gen in Rare Diseases; we have products in Duchenne's; we have rivipansel; we have tafamidis and tanezumab in pain. I probably think tafamidis was the most risky of those alternatives. And we are extremely pleased with the data from tafamidis.","Inflammation, we have JAK-1, atopic dermatitis, JAK-3, TYK2\/JAK-1, Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. I think we have about 10 potential therapies in our JAK kinase franchise. So I mean really exciting stuff.","And Oncology, we continue to look at targeted cancer agents, Ibrance, intermediate high-risk breast cancer; Xtandi in non-metastatic; we've got PROSPER, EMBARK, and ARCHER. So I think that is what will drive a really robust top line growth.","Now turning to this issue of legacy. I don't really think a lot about that. I think deals are done based on value to shareholders.","As you say, we've looked at different strategies over the years. Our decision making changes when the facts change. Right now, I think \u2013 I would like to think that the legacy that when I do retire that I will leave to patients and to Pfizer is that of a extremely robust pipeline that's beginning to deliver and a really strong culture of ownership and doing the right thing for patients.","With that, I'll hand it over to Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and then, Jami, on operating leverage, let me just run some numbers for this year, and then I'll answer the question.","So if you look at the midpoint of our revenue guidance for this year, if you look at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, compare that to last year, revenue is up 4%, adjusted EPS is up 11%. So clearly, the ability to continue to demonstrate operating leverage in terms of revenue, the top line to the bottom line.","Going forward, I would leave our margins relatively where they are. If you look at our gross margin, look at operating margin, they're very strong, top quartile of the industry. I think for modeling purposes, we'd leave them where they are.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Can we move to the next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. If I could just go back to the pipeline and your level of excitement, you guys have a long list of products. And it's almost a laundry list. Some of those invariably will be smaller commercial opportunities, like PARP, maybe JAK imatinib, maybe a new ALK inhibitor.","I'm hoping you can narrow the discussion down to maybe two or three of those products that you think will be the most commercially significant drivers of future growth, as you look forward over the next, call it, five years.","And second question, kind of bringing up this old topic of splitting up the company. You've talked about robustness in the business and how both divisions, both Innovative and Essential, are in increasingly better shape. I know some companies have further digested the tax reform rules that came out before, and they've had a different view of what that means for them going forward. So my question to you on this is, is there any possibility of reconsidering splitting up the company over the next few years? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Tim, thank you for the question. I don't think it's a laundry list. I think all of those products we mentioned, either individually or grouped like the targeted Oncology therapies, have potentials to be blockbusters.","It's difficult to pick out one specific product. But I would say when you look at the totality, I would focus on our vaccine franchise, especially C.difficile. I would look at the huge potential of tafamidis, I would look at tanezumab in pain.","And then frankly, I think the Inflammation\/Immunology franchise, taken as a whole, is probably the best in the industry. And we could get into all of the different indications and products there. But if you look at the depth and strength of our science in that area, I'm really excited about our ability to drive meaningful growth from that franchise.","Vis-a-vis the tax law and the split potential, I'll ask Frank to make a few comments on that.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so on the tax law, obviously we've had more time to digest and analyze the new tax laws, tax reform. We're even more comfortable with the guidance we provided for the year, which is approximately 17% on the tax rate.","On the split, what we've said previously on optionality is that we were taking it off the table for the foreseeable future. So from our perspective, no change. We never say never to anything. But right now, for the foreseeable future, we're all about executing on the business.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank and Ian for that. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just have a few. Ian, with the recent win for tafamidis and the technology deals in the space, just wanted to see if Rare Disease is elevated at all in your strategic priority list. It's a good category. But Pfizer would have to add scale to have it really move the needle.","And then just on the product side, just wondering if you guys have an update on the progress of Xtandi moving upstream to the M0 population. I know that was a big part of the original value proposition with the Medivation deal and just wanted to check on the progress thus far. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, thank you. I think we have critical mass in Rare Diseases. We've committed capital to that. We've committed capital to production.","We have not only two possibilities in Duchenne's, we have sickle cell, we have tafamidis, we have tanezumab, we have gene therapy. I'm confident that we have the critical mass. And if assets become available that could be added to that as a bolt on that had significant value, we would act on that. But once again we've always been I think very disciplined in our allocation. And we haven't seen those opportunities as yet.","I would ask Albert to talk about Xtandi and its movement into the early population.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Absolutely. And also just to add in the Rare Disease, that it is a multibillion dollar business right now. We have four assets that they are in Phase 3. We are expecting readouts as we speak.","Cardiomyopathy, it is the one that Ian spoke, but we have also rivipansel. And we have the gene therapy platform that we have already in clinic. Three different modality, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, all in Rare Disease.","Now let me speak about Xtandi and your question about earlier treatments. And I do believe, we do believe that moving Xtandi into earlier treatment settings represents a potential significant opportunity.","In the short term, we are focused on the non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer indication, which is based on the positive results and filing acceptance that we got of the PROSPER study. As you know, we had priority review for that. We have a PDUFA date in July. And hopefully we will see this medicine grow to patients in the near term.","Now in the medium term, we believe growth will potentially come from expanding the Xtandi indication into hormone sensitive prostate cancer. We have the EMBARK trial, but it is in non-metastatic hormone sensitive, and we have the ARCHES trial, which is in metastatic hormone sensitive.","So both studies are progressing very nicely. They are definitely on their timeline. And we are very optimistic about their success.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. First, Ian, on Consumer, if timing is not right and, for whatever set of circumstances, you can't get a fair price for Consumer in the near term, how interested are you in doing something external to Pfizer, like a spinner JV, as opposed to retaining and likely needing to invest in it?","And then perhaps, Albert, you can talk about the competitive threat to the Prevnar franchise that you see from Merck. When could you get your next gen Prevnar to market versus Merck's? And what's next on the legal front? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. On the Consumer business it's a good asset. We said we were looking at strategic alternatives to see if there was a better owner. As I commented, we don't at this moment see value in the sale.","We'll focus on running the business. We had a very good quarter. I'm very pleased with the way our Consumer colleagues have reacted and are working hard. We'll look during the year at potential spins or joint ventures.","But you know, frankly, the business is a good business. And if we can't get value, we'll retain it, we'll invest in it. And it continues to be important to us in that sense. Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. From what we know, Merck has a pediatric program for a 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine in Phase 2. And the adult program is awaiting start of Phase 3. This is what they have said so far, Merck officials.","But let me talk to you about our program. We have entered the clinic with the next generation, 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine. And this is expected to include seven additional serotypes in addition to those covered by Prevnar 13. All seven significantly improve the coverage in the current dosage space.","Our result from Phase I trial demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and it was well tolerable. But more importantly demonstrated that the induced functional immune responses that could kill all 20 serotypes. So these results supported advancement into Phase 2 that was initiated last year. And right now it is fully enrolled. So if everything goes as planned, we could start our Phase 3 trials in 2019.","All in all, assuming regulatory success for both vaccines and not accounting for patent protection issues that we mentioned, we would anticipate launching in a competitive timeframe to Merck, a much broader spectrum of coverage quality.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I had two on R&D and one for Ian.","Maybe starting out on R&D. On Bavencio, so it's my understanding that the half life is materially less than the competitor PD-1. So it's about three days for Bavencio; it's about 14 to 21 days for competitors. However, the dosing frequency of Bavencio is comparable to Opdivo. So my question is, just want to understand the thought process behind that dosing frequency, given the half-life difference? As well as whether you think that's played any role on efficacy in some of the trials we've seen lately?","Secondly, on tafamidis, congrats on the data. And my question is, how do you see the competitive landscape versus Alnylam's patisiran, especially in light of the recent post-hoc analysis that Alnylam showed on cardiac outcomes? And about a 45% reduction is what they were seeing in the post-hoc basis.","And then finally, Ian, there's been some investor commentary lately on whether your recent comments on not looking for transformative M&A is mainly aimed at controlling the price of the potential target, so that it meets the valuation thresholds when you do actually potentially revisit it in three to six months. How do you react to that? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Let me deal with that last question first. We continually look at all deals, as I said. We look for value for shareholders. I don't think we're that smart enough to be gaining anything to that extent.","Frankly, we don't \u2013 I don't see that we need a transformative deal, nor do I see one at appropriate values right now in the marketplace. We'll continue to use our capital wisely. I believe at this moment in time, although things can always change, marketplaces can change, I believe the best investment we have now is in our own pipeline.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Mikael to answer the half-life question, and then probably take the tafamidis question as well, as it's still in research phase.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for that. Yeah, we did together with our partner Merck KGgA, substantial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. At the current dose, 10 mg\/kg intravenously every two weeks, well should cover the PD-L1 target for blocking that receptor.","You may have noted that we also have an aspect that the antibody has ADCC [antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity], which could be a unique property. And we have one study that tried to address whether it can be a positive differentiated property with an even more intense dosing regimen.","Concerning tafamidis, we are, as Ian alluded to, extremely enthusiastic to share the positive results that was in a cardiomyopathy population. And as you know, the endpoint was all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization.","That study includes wild-type TTR and mutant TTR. For cardiomyopathy, it is to a major extent the wild-type and to minor extent patients having the mutant. So this is quite different from the other biotech companies using injectable that primarily were focused on polyneuropathy.","Some of those polyneuropathy patients that have the mutant form may also have later in life cardiac symptoms. To the best of my knowledge, those were measured with more functional data, and there were no hard endpoints related to cardiovascular hospitalization or even more, of course, mortality data related to cardiac patients.","And finally, to the best of my knowledge, there are no pivotal studies on wild-type patients outside of tafamidis, which is again, the major patients in United States and the Western world suffering from this difficult fatal disease.","So we believe we are, to the best of our knowledge, years ahead of anyone else to have such interesting data set. And we also believe it's a disease that is not well-diagnosed and has substantial potential.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. We move to our next questioner, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just quick question on Ibrance. As the share of growth shifts in the near to medium term to the ex-U.S. markets, just wondering if you can kind of talk us through the progression in those markets of sales uptick, given that you now have reimbursement in EU established and Japan is coming online. So can you talk us through the progression there? And do you think that ex-U.S. markets can ultimately one day be as big as the U.S.?","And then just secondly, just on Eucrisa. Understand there's still maybe a fair amount of free product in the channel, so difficult to really gauge the product at this point. But could you provide a little bit of direction or commentary just around when we could start to see a bigger uptick in revenue generating scripts? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Jason. I'll ask Albert to answer both of those good questions.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Jason. And I'm sure you've noticed we are very, very pleased with the progression of Ibrance in the international markets.","We have very strong growth. It was in excess of 170% of growth of sales, so almost tripled. Volume has been higher than that. As of December, Ibrance made up 98% of the total plus packs sold in the EU5.","And also we did progress a lot with reimbursement. Right now, Ibrance is reimbursed in all of EU5, finally, and in Japan, as you mentioned. And in total we have 25 markets that Ibrance is reimbursed right now outside of the U.S. So we expect to have a significant progress and growth acceleration in that part of the world.","And coming back to your question on the U.S. I think first of all, let me make some comments on the U.S., and then I will compare it with the European markets, the ex-U.S. size of the markets.","But in the U.S. we have seen everything that we predicted. CDK class share in the first line new starts continues to steadily grow, as we had predicted. It is now 69% from 58% at the end of last quarter. And Ibrance continues to hold the leadership position in first line, again as we had also predicted. It grew up the market share this quarter to 56% from 52%.","In fact, the scripts grew much faster than the sales in the U.S. We've had 26% growth of scripts, we had 19% growth of sales. And mainly the gap is attributable to fluctuation of buying patterns. I think it's going to be back to normal situation in the months ahead.","And also I want to remember that the growth opportunities in the U.S. have not been exhausted by any means. Right now, in the U.S., while the CDK market of first line new patients is 69% of the CDK, if you see across all lines of treatment, it is only 53%. So we believe that there is significant opportunity to grow the class. And of course Ibrance has now more than 90% of the class share right now.","The size of it too. I think that when it comes to utilization, penetration, and volume of patients, yes, the European markets will do as well if not better than the U.S. market. Of course there is very different price point that needs to be factored when we try to assess the total market.","Now a few comments on Eucrisa. The prescriptions were 90,000 this quarter and \u2013 94,000. And that was a growth compared to previous quarter of 6%.","However, it was slower growth than we had in the fourth quarter, but we had all times peak of the growth. We had 55% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. And this slow down in growth is attributable to the year beginning effort, in which churn in the insurance market suppresses branded prescription demand, as patient adjust to changes in their insurance plans. This has been reported by other companies as well. And to give you a magnitude, we grew 6%, while the total atopic dermatitis was flat.","Right now, we are focusing our efforts in Eucrisa in two areas. One, to make sure that to broaden trial and adoption rates. A lot of dermatologists are entrenched to use steroids right now. And also to improve access. And we have plans in place to do both.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, Ian and Frank, on capital allocation, given your collective observations on some of your competitors premium biotech acquisition, together with your comments, Ian, about the pipeline strength and its under appreciation perhaps, should we expect further additional buybacks on top of what you've already committed to this year?","Second, on U.S. biosimilars, and this feeds into your mature products business, do you expect a significant increase in the adoption of biosimilars in the U.S., driven by insurers taking on board biosimilars first, given the pressure from the FDA, HHS, as well as the vertical integration taking place?","And finally, for Mikael, should we expect an interim for the PALLAS adjuvant trial for Ibrance in 2019? Many thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on the biosimilars, Andrew, we continue to make progress in the U.S. with our own commercial efforts. But I believe that it will take an effort by the administration to move that market, given the substantial advantage the entrenched companies have over the rebating system. So I'm looking forward to activity from the administration on that.","But that being said, we continue to look for a good growth in that area. And it will certainly accelerate post any action from the administration. PALLAS, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, we expect the PALLAS trial for intermediate and high-risk early breast cancer in adjuvant treatment to run until the primary completion date, which is in 2020 to have sufficient number events.","We remain very encouraged about the translation for metastatic to early breast cancer and have very much confidence in the strengths of IBRANCE based on other new adjuvant studies of the same type of tumor that has been positive.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So I would agree with you, Andrew. 100% of the pipeline is undervalued. I would ask Frank to make a quick comment on capital allocation.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so on capital allocation, Andrew, our priorities haven't changed. They remain dividends, share buybacks, investing in the business, and M&A where it makes sense.","Specific to buybacks, to answer your question, in the first quarter we did $6.1 billion in share buybacks at an average price of $36.23. And just in terms of a little history, if you go back to 2010 we've repurchased $61.7 billion worth of our shares, 2.2 billion shares retired at an average price of $27.35. So it's been a very good trade.","In terms of going forward, which is really what you asked me, we announced that $4 billion accelerated share repurchase on March 12 of this year. It'll take several months for that to complete. Once that completes, we'll assess where we are. And then we'll make a decision on whether or not to do anything further on buybacks.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks very much. I just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on the opportunity for Ibrance in early stage breast cancer. First, could you please discuss the NSABP's Ibrance PALLET trial? I understand that it's small. It's a neoadjuvant, and it's 14 weeks. But I was hoping that you could frame your expectations for that trial?","And then, Mikael, I know that you commented on Ibrance in the adjuvant setting in response to the prior question. So if you could just comment about both of those trials, both PALLAS and PENELOPE-B, and your level of confidence in success in late 2020? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, all yours. No, sorry, we need Mikael to answer it.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. First of all, on the PALLAS study, which we think \u2013 it's run by a collaborative organization, academic, but we think it will readout relatively soon and be reported in the fall.","I have high confidence that we will see a very robust signal based on previous similar studies in the adjuvant, such as the study run by Washington University's of Dr. [Cynthia] Ma and [Dr. Matthew] Ellis that showed a very profound complete cell cycle arrest and also quite impressive responses, complete responses, in a neoadjuvant setting. And it's a very similar patient population to the PALLAS study that you referred to.","And to study the primary endpoint, they used the very same Ki-67 proliferation marker. So I have a strong confidence in a good outcome of pilot based on previous science.","And we think therefore that we should have a very optimistic view on PENELOPE [-B] and PALLAS event-driven, adjuvant trials to hopefully, for the benefit of patients, expand Ibrance into a population of early breast cancer that may be twice as big as the metastatic population. So we look forward to see those studies conclude.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a couple questions, one on the innovative side with Xeljanz. The product was a little bit less than what we had expected. I'm just wondering if there's been any impact seen on that product, given some of the concerns around thromboembolic disorders with baracitim (49:55), as that went through its review process. And maybe if you can also just frame what you see as the opportunity for UC ahead of that action date next month.","And then on the biosimilar side, just a question on biosimilar Remicade. I just noticed it did have a little bit of a decline sequentially from last quarter in developed Europe, and I assume it was due to competition. But just wondering if you can give a little more clarity on what exactly is driving that. And if it is competition, is it driven by Biogen\/Samsung? Or is it driven more by the fact that Celltrion has other distributors selling the product as well? Thanks so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Albert, if you could take both those questions?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Xeljanz revenues were up this quarter 30% in the U.S. Particularly like you referred, the growth was 19%. However, the scripts grew 33%. So there is a sizable gap between the scripts and the sales. And most of that is attributable, as with Eucrisa, in buying patterns that, as I said, also other companies reported.","But the fact that this quarter already we see that this is normalized in the months after the quarter. So there is no slowdown on scripts as a regard of any concern. And as we have repeatedly said, that we do not think that there is any correlation in Xeljanz with this type of side effects.","Going to the UC, it is, as you know, under registration. The opportunity, it is large. In the G7, the market, it is approximately $5 billion, affects approximately 1.8 million of people.","We are very encouraged by the efficacy and safety results of Xeljanz in the OPAL Study for psoriatic arthritis and OCTAVE study for UC. We had a very positive advisory committee. We have very positive interactions with regulators. And frankly, we expect that the product will be approved in the near future.","Now, ulcers. I cannot comment on Remicade. But our self, we grew 53% globally and 39% versus last year. And we are very happy with how things are evolving in the international markets, frankly.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thank you, Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Our history is in the U.S., where there's disproportionately smaller penetration than whatever is happening in the rest of the world, because of some contracting practices.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on your results. First one for both Ian and Mikael. If you look at your portfolio of assets and your pipeline, you certainly have the makings of a decent sized orphan disease platform. Certainly your hemophilia franchise through your Factor VIII and IX business, along with your gene therapy programs with Spark [Therapeutics], along with tafamidis and other assets, seems as though that might be going forward, a very important strategic area. So, Ian, just your thoughts around that and the build-out of that pipeline also, Mikael.","Second question for Frank. On other income, was $250 million in the quarter, but you're guiding to only $400 million. That seems to be a little low. What are some of the pushes and pulls there?","And then lastly, FDA has been pretty vocal on advancing new policies to try and stimulate more biosimilar development, with about a dozen policies that incrementally could move the ball in the direction to try and create more biosimilar competition. What are some of the policies and procedures that you think could move the needle in favor of biosimilars going forward?","And then just any commentary on your Herceptin Complete Response Letter? And when you think you might resolve that? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Mikael, why don't you talk a little bit about our orphan disease portfolio? I believe we're investing in it. I don't think there's any restrictions in our capital investment. If we see opportunities outside, we'll take them. But internally we have a lot of substrate to work with. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Yeah. Basically, we are focused on hemophilia neuromuscular disease and with some interest also in metabolic rare disease.","Hemophilia, as you know, we have a long history and successful presence in the marketplace treating hemophilia A and B. We are very excited about our hemophilia B program that concluded successfully based on gene therapy, is successfully proved for concept and is progressing in partnership with Spark towards pivotal studies.","We have a hemophilia A, partnered with Sangamo [Therapeutics], where we make progress in dose escalation. And we also have a Pfizer monoclonal antibody against TFPI for weekly subcutaneous convenient delivery for all types of hemophilia, where we've seen some early encouraging sign. Also we think it's a really interesting portfolio.","On the neuromuscular disease side, Ian alluded to that we started gene therapy for Duchenne's. And we also have a pivotal readout with a monoclonal antibody against myostatin in Duchenne's, which we look upon as a high-risk high-reward opportunity.","And of course within cardiomyopathy with tafamidis, we look very much forward to share the data and to swiftly advance the regulatory dialogues.","And finally, end of the year in sickle cell disease, another component of our hematology opportunity in Rare Disease, we have also likely year of the \u2013 end-of-the-year readout for rivipansel. And we are look forward with encouragement based on that mechanism has played out well in the Phase 2.","As Ian alluded to, we think we are well-resourced with all modalities in immunotherapy and end-to-end capability, as well as non-in-therapy modalities. And we will continue to do internal as well as licensing flash bolt-on to accelerate.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Other income deductions, Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so, John, other income for the quarter was actually about a $320 million good guy, income for the quarter. So then that relative to the 400 million for the year, really three major drivers there.","One is we had some one-time milestone payments to the tune of about $115 million. We had $110 million in unrealized gains on equity securities. And we don't try to project those. And those could turn one way or the other going forward. And then the third big ticket item is net interest expense. Interest income for the quarter, about $75 million. Interest expense, about $315 million. You net that out, about $240 million per quarter in net interest expense going forward for the remainder of the year.","When we put that together, we think it's prudent to leave the other income at approximately $400 million.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, biosimilars, including Herceptin","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Let me start with the first one was around the policy of biosimilars. Look, we are very encouraged by the words of FDA and other people in Trump's administration. We just wait now to translate these words into tangible actions that can reverse the situation.","Keep in mind that the biosimilars penetration \u2013 let's take infliximab. In Europe, it's 56%. In the U.S., our share is 6%, so there is something wrong with that.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","But not in closed systems.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Actually, thank you for raising that. You see in closed systems, we have 66% in this quarter. Half of our sales are coming in closed systems. Closed systems meaning when the provider is the same person with the person \u2013 who the payer. And when it comes to value, we always win. And this is what we want to see that prevails.","Now back to your question about trastuzumab. We did receive, unexpectedly actually, a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. Basically FDA was asking additional technical information clarifications. We didn't think that something like that would come to a Complete Response Letter.","I want to clarify that those questions were not related either to safety nor to clinical data submitted. And they had nothing to do with \u2013 pertaining to our manufacturing abilities.","But nevertheless, at this times we do not anticipate that the FDA action will have any impact on our plans to launch of trastuzumab. We think that we will be able to respond to this queries and get it approved before our protected launch date.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thanks, Albert. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first on the Essential Health business. Could we just get a little bit more color on the legacy Hospira shortages? I believe you said you expect the injectable business to be flat year over year, but the Q1 results were still showing some erosion. Could we just talk a little bit about how you see these issues resolving? How quickly you think you can recapture share once you're back at normalized capacity?","And the second question was on tafamidis. Can you just comment on the size of the cardiomyopathy patient population you're going to be pursuing? And do you believe the ATTR-ACT data suggests potential for this product in polyneuropathy? And if so, do you have to run additional studies there? Or can you refile in that setting? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, why don't you handle those questions, and ask Mikael to comment as you see fit?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Thank you 9very much, Ian. Look in PEH, a general comment, as you know, we \u2013 the business declined 9%. But I think you see the legacy Pfizer, the decline was only 2%, despite the loss of exclusivities. Most of the decline came from the Hospira legacy, 38%, partly because of the divestment of the device businesses, but also because of supplies that we fail with our sterile injectables.","We do believe that the revenues from this portfolio roughly will be flat this year compared to last year. I think we had the decline this quarter, likely we will see a decline next quarter as well. And then we'll see growth in the third and fourth quarter. So overall, we'll be roughly flat.","We anticipate this situation. And we have incorporated into the guidance that Frank provided, the beginning of the year. And we continue our very comprehensive remediation plans to upgrade and modernize these facilities in Hospira. We are in constant contact with the FDA. And we have increased substantially our investments into this manufacturing site. So we believe that as I said we will be flat. And then next year, we will start providing much more capacity available that we do not have now.","As regards to tafamidis, let me make a comment on the market opportunity, and then I will ask Mikael to help into the more scientific question. The TTR cardiomyopathy is a rare progressive disease. And it is a fatal disease. People that are diagnosed with this disease, they have a life expectancy of three to seven years unfortunately. It is almost like unfortunately a death sentence.","The prevalence of the disease is currently unknown, but it is expected that less than 1% of the people are diagnosed in the U.S. And already, this number is several thousand. So we believe that by working towards improving awareness and diagnostic rates of this disease, we will be able to provide meaningful assistance to those people that they have virtually no options. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. That was terrific background of the disease. So I can only build on what Albert said.","Its data suggests the disease is vastly underdiagnosed. And we've seen some recent external figures estimating that just in U.S., it may be more than 100,000 patients related to TTR cardiomyopathy. This is likely driven by the wild type, the senile systemic amyloidosis caused by the wild type, as its increase is dramatically \u2013 has contributed to cardiomyopathy with growing age in an aging population.","And now with increasing availability of diagnostic tools and of course availability of drugs potentially pending regulatory dialogues, a drug like tafamidis, there would be large incentives to do more early diagnosis that will allow patients to be treated for longer time before they progress and have this dire prognosis that Albert alluded to.","There's also the mutant form that can be diagnosed very easily earlier in life. But we do think there are opportunities to also diagnose wild type in a more efficient manner. So that's why we're excited about this, having this large data set on wild type TTR cardiomyopathy. And we look forward to the dialogues with regulators and potentially how to contribute to early diagnosis, awareness of the disease to help patients.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And the population of our study, Mikael, included both types, right? Wild types and...","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","It does. Of course initially, the patient group accessible will be mainly with academic medical centers, which is a fraction of the number I shared. But as awareness grows, the disease will be likely diagnosed at many cardiology clinics.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thank you, both, Albert and Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Ibrance Q1 EU sales were flat with that in Q3 of 2017. Given the negative sales in Q4, I would have expected a nice recovery. So can you speak to that specifically? And is price the explanation for this disparity?","Second, what were Ibrance and Xeljanz stocking numbers in Q1?","And then lastly, on tafamidis, sorry to ask again, but just to clarify prior answers. Based on the data you have and the data you'll present this year, can you get a broad label for patients with predominantly neurological manifestation and a broad label covering a range of disease severities? It sounds like the answer is yes on both, but please just confirm. Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael, could you give a brief comment on the potential avenues for diagnosis and labeling?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, we certainly believe on the comprehensive data that we have an opportunity to discuss a broad label for cardiomyopathy. Concerning neuropathy, we do have earlier trials, smaller in nature. But it was sufficient for registration in Europe. And we do have registered to date, though, many patients in Europe that they're doing very well on tafamidis.","And we will look at opportunity in dialogues with the various divisions at the FDA for an opportunity that would cover multiple patient population, as you alluded to.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On the Ibrance question, when you are in a phase of looking for listings in Europe, it's very difficult to get a read on the total value of the products, as very often you sell under emergency protocols at a price that is not necessarily relevant to the final price you get or to the U.S. price, for that matter.","So we see very robust uptake with physicians of Ibrance. And we see an impact of course on the revenue, as we adjust to the reimbursement levels of Ibrance that will give us sustained and a growing opportunity for a substantial patient number increase in Europe. So I think this is part of what we do when we negotiate for access. And we feel we have a very strong strategy around access and future growth in Europe.","Albert, do you want to add anything to the questions?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","For Europe, I'd say you said it very well. And we think that the prices that we got represent good value. And they are in line with what usually products are priced in Europe.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And the inventory levels of the movement in \u2013 can we \u2013 it's very difficult for us to measure that, because it's very \u2013 a lot of it's specialty. And we don't have a very strong control, whereas with the distributors in general, we know very well what inventory levels are.","So by deduction, we know that the scripts were up. We know where the revenue was. We know that we don't believe it's a net pricing effect. So by difference, it has to be inventory movements.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And just to add that our calculations reveal that most of the gap, it is because of inventory movement.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yes.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. First on Xeljanz. Roughly, what proportion of Xeljanz in the U.S. is coming from TNF-na\u00efve patients as opposed to TNF experienced?","And a follow-up on biosimilars. It appears that the Europeans are becoming more aggressive in their adoption of biosimilars. Wondering if I could get your thoughts there. And could you comment on the implications of that both as a headwind for Xeljanz and a tailwind for your biosimilars pipeline? Specifically, would you be able to provide some expected launch timeframes for some of the key biosimilar products in Europe? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, would you like to address this?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. On the Xeljanz question, we estimate that more than 50% of our patients comes from na\u00efve patients. And...","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And the other question, I think, the Xeljanz opportunities in Europe are just beginning. It's in the actual usage of the product. It's not that the majority is na\u00efve to TNFs, because the growth of the marketplace itself is slow. So it has to be people who've converted over from TNF to using Xeljanz.","The important thing with Xeljanz is that it's a lot of usage in monotherapy, which we think allows us to distinguish ourselves from the TNFs as they go off patent. So I see a very aggressive growth rate for Xeljanz in Europe and a very aggressive growth rate for our biosimilars as well.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners","Thanks very much. Two brief questions. Mikael, given the outcome of the JAVELIN lung study, what's the position that you feel Pfizer will be in relative to lung as a histology for Bavencio or any other combination and\/or combinations moving forward?","And then second to that, does that actually change or does the outcome actually change your strategy or the focus from one of identifying patients, who may respond to a particular monotherapy, I-O monotherapy, or simply combinations for everybody? Is that strategy, is there a difference that may occur perhaps as a result of JAVELIN lung? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael. And then perhaps Albert may want to add anything on the strategy or commercial strategy.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, we've always been focusing on combinations as the way to go over the longer term. And over the next 18 months, we have six pivotal readouts across five tumor types, of which five of them are combinations and only one is monotherapy to first line lung, including first and second line ovarian, with chemo, renal, in light as a targeted therapy, gastric with Bavencio as maintenance off the chemo. Bladder with Bavencio as maintenance off the chemo.","And the first line lung was designed very differently from the second line. It contains hierarchical readout for high PD-L1 and intermediate PD-L1. And a combined endpoint for PFS and overall survival.","So I think we will be able to mitigate any impact or crossover from control group to either marketed PD agent that we recorded in the second line earlier. So we feel pretty good about this cohort of readouts in the next 18 months. And of course many earlier clinical studies that are not pivotal but will generate the good combination data.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Mikael. And, operator, if we can take one last question, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, just a continuation on the I-O. I was curious your thoughts, Mikael, about TMB as a biomarker? And how much development work you think should be put into that?","And then just on Prevnar, just in the U.S. I know U.S., you can give us a little color on what's going on and how you think about the growth there. Thanks.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Concerning TMB, we think it's interesting to explore additional biomarkers beyond PD-L1. To the best of my knowledge, I think PD-L1 is the biomarker right now that has solid data concerning both PFS and overall survival, while TMB is, at this stage, mainly reported PFS data and far less OS data.","So I think we need more time to understand how TMB will fit into it. But obviously we think it's the way to go to have numerous ways to analyze high responders. But our strategy as I said previously will be to utilize those information pieces with drug combinations.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, on the Prevnar. First of all to say that the overall sales were slightly declined 3%. And as you mentioned, U.S. was the main driver of the decline with 12%. But I want also to emphasize the significant growth in emerging markets. We had 45% growth. And this is due to multiple factors. But the most important is we just launched in China, where we expect that we will have very good uptake.","Now the specific information you asked for, the U.S. In the U.S. we've had a 12% decline. And this is a combination of both adult and pediatric. Pediatric actually declined 14%, but that was purely CDC purchasing patterns. This is common. CDC, when you have big governmental purchases, they can happen one month or the other, and that can affect your growth. So we think that the pediatric U.S. will grow eventually for the year.","And the U.S. adult declined 7%. Actually, I think it is rather positive, the fact that now we are slowing down the declines as we are coming more to steady state of the adult penetrations.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Albert, and thank you, everybody, for your attention this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2012 performance. Today I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Establish Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development, who is joining us remotely due to the storm situation; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel, President and General Manager of Pfizer Nutrition; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer quarterly corporate performance, third quarter 2012 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right-hand corner of this page. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8K.","Discussion during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8K dated today, November 1, 2011. In addition, we will offer some brief comments regarding our preparation and target timeline for the potential IPO of the minority stake in our Animal Health business, Zoetis, and as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand we\u2019re not going to be able to respond to questions on that subject in light of the quiet period imposed by securities laws.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ian Read.","Ian Read","Thank you, Chuck. During my remarks this morning I will briefly discuss the quarter and touch on some noteworthy events that happened in the last weeks. Overall our performance remains in line with our full year guidance. As we\u2019ve discussed over the course of the year, our financial performance in the near-term will continue to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity, notably Lipitor in all major developed countries. Year-to-date we have absorbed approximately $5.5 billion in LOEs. I would note the most significant impact on revenues from LOEs will be in 2012 and this impact will decline significantly in subsequent years.","To mitigate the impact to our earnings per share we are producing growth from key lines, patented products including Lyrica and Celebrex globally and Viagra in the U.S. We are seeing growth in emerging markets most notably in China, Mexico and Russia. On a year-to-date basis our emerging market business has delivered solid performance with 10% growth on an operational basis.","We have been effectively managing our cost structure and using the strength of the balance sheet. For example, while revenue for the quarter declined 12% on an operational basis, our adjusted cost of sales FIA expenses and R&D expenses in total decreased operationally by 8%. And if you exclude the $250 million payment of AstraZeneca for the exclusive worldwide rights to the over the counter Nexium they would\u2019ve declined 11% operationally bringing costs down in line with the revenue decline we saw this quarter.","We continue to execute our share repurchase program. During the quarter we repurchased $1.8 billion of common stock and our year-to-date repurchases are almost $6 billion. The board has authorized an additional $10 billion in share repurchase to be utilized over time upon completion of the sale of nutritionals to Nestl\u00e9 which we now anticipate in the next few months. Our potential IPO for animal health remains on track and depending on market conditions, we continue to expect the IPO to happen during the first half of 2013. As for our regular practice, I expect the board to set the dividend rate for 2013 at its meeting in December.","Turning now to some recent noteworthy events. I remain confident that the quality of the assets and the progress I see in our pipeline. We have a robust set of potential high-value assets across our key therapeutic areas. They include some in early and mid stages for diabetes pain and cardiovascular diseases. Vaccines for mening B at adolescence and Staph aureus. Late stage in coli compounds and recent advances for key pipeline assets.","Concerning tofacitinib, we are looking forward to hearing from the FDA about our NDA on or before the upcoming PDUFA date this month. Tofa was discovered by Pfizer scientists in our labs in Groton, Connecticut. If approved it will be the first new oral disease modifying therapy for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in more than 10 years. It has the potential to change the way healthcare providers treat RA. It would also be the first RA treatment and new class of drugs known as Ganis Hynais or JAK inhibitors.","And if approved it will be a first in class product that we believe will offer a compelling clinical profile and an effective new treatment option for patients. Regarding Eliquis, the FDA has resumed its review of the Eliquis NDA and set a new action date of March 17, 2013. We and our alliance partners, Bristol-Myers Squibb remain confident in the therapy profile of Eliquis and that we can receive FDA approval by the new PDUFA date.","Turning to oncology, Xalkori just received conditional marketing authorization in the E.U. for previously-treated out-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our conditional marketing authorization in the E.U. is similar to accelerated approval for the United States. They have granted to medical products with positive benefit-risk assessment that addresses unmet medical needs and whose availability would result in a significant public health benefit.","Pfizer will submit data to the NEA from the recently-completed study which met its primary endpoint and previously-treated out positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. For a review of this data, the European commission will consider converting the conditional marketing authorization to a full marketing authorization.","And coming at our consumer business, we are encouraged by positive news that multivitamins resulting from the physician\u2019s health study 2 conducted by investigators at Brigham and Woman\u2019s Hospital, a teaching hospital at Harvard University. We are pleased that the study investigators chose Centrum Silver based on its quality and consistency, among other factors. For the duration of the 11-years study that tested the role of multivitamins in relation to long-term health benefits. I would note that Centrum is the sixth largest OTC brand in the world and Centrum Silver is the world\u2019s number one selling multivitamin for adults 50 and over.","We have recently launched new products, Inlyta in Europe, Busleth in the U.S. and we will soon launch Xalkori in Europe. I remain confident that we have a strong pipeline focused in the therapeutic areas where we have strengths and which can deliver our next wave of innovative products. I am pleased with how we are executing on decisions we have made to create meaningful incremental shareholder value for the potential animal health IPO and Nutrition sale.","We are seeing good results from the actions we are taking to manage costs across the business. We continue to make shareholder-friendly capital allocation decisions and finally, we are making decisions that we believe have the potential to drive future earnings per share growth.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to again remind you that the Nutrition business is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. As you know, discontinued operations are excluded from adjusted financial results. Consequently, throughout 2012 the results of the Nutrition business have been excluded from adjusted results.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Third-quarter 2012 revenues of approximately $14 billion decreased 16% year-over-year reflecting a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 12% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies notably, Lipitor, in all major markets.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 decreased 12% primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues which was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 8% in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting in cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower adjusted tax rate of 28.3% and fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchases.","Reported diluted EPS of $0.43 decreased 10%. In addition to the factors previously mentioned, reported diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a U.S. tax settlement and negatively impacted primarily from the non-recurrence of the gain on the sale of Capsugel in the year ago quarter.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by 4% or $699 million and favorably impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $440 million or 5%. This negative impact was primarily driven by the euro and to a lesser extent, the Brazilian real, versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02.","In the third quarter of 2012, emerging markets biopharmaceutical revenues were approximately $2.4 billion, which reflects operational growth of 6% and a negative impact of foreign exchange of 8%. I want to point out that the volatility in our emerging markets quarterly revenues was driven primarily by Prevnar purchasing patents specifically the timing of government purchases of Prevnar 13 in Turkey compared to the year ago quarter.","Volume growth of 8% in emerging markets was partially offset by price reductions of 2% resulting in the 6% operational growth. Of the third quarter emerging markets biopharmaceutical revenues approximately 41% was generated by established products, 33% by specialty and oncology products and 26% by primary care products.","Third quarter biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets were approximately $1.1 billion which reflects operational growth of 9% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%. Of the third quarter BRIC-MT biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 42% was generated by established products, 30% by specialty and oncology products and 28% by primary care products.","During the third quarter, biopharmaceutical volume growth of 10% in the BRIC-MT markets most notably in China, Mexico and Russia, was partially offset by price reductions of 1% resulting in operational growth of 9%. Year-to-date, operational growth in the BRIC-MT markets was 13% versus a year ago quarter reflecting volume growth of 16% partially offset by price reductions of 3%.","Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges for our full-year guidance components. We are narrowing the reported revenue range to $58 billion to $59 billion from $58 billion to $60 billion. We are decreasing and narrowing the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenues to 18.7% to 19.2%. We are decreasing and narrowing our adjusted SI&A expense range to $16.3 billion to $16.8 billion. We are narrowing our R&D guidance range to $7 billion to $7.25 billion. I want to point out that our R&D guidance includes the $250 million payment to AstraZeneca for the exclusive global over the counter rights to Nexium which were recorded in the third quarter.","We now expect other deductions to be approximately $900 million and continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. We are increasing and narrowing the range of our reported diluted EPS to $1.30 to $1.38 and we are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to $2.14 to $2.17. Finally, we now expect operating cash flow to be approximately $18.5 billion which reflects the charge related to the RapidUse settlement recorded in the third quarter.","Our third quarter results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products mainly Lipitor in all major markets. That said we are continuing to mitigate the impact of Lipitor LOE with expense discipline and share repurchases. We received U.S. regulatory approval for bosutinib and in European Union we received approval for inlatum and conditional marketing authorization for Xalkori. We filed a registration statement in mid August for a potential initial public offering of up to a 20% ownership stake in the animal health business to be named Zoetis. In addition, we filed an amendment to the S1 on October 10th which included updated financial statements through the second quarter 2012.","We remain on track to complete a potential IPO in the first half of 2013 and as we continue to work toward a separation of the business we remain open to all alternatives to maximize the after tax returns for shareholders.","We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation with approximately $5.9 billion or 255 million shares repurchased through October 31st. Approximately $4.1 billion of authorization remains under the current repurchase program.","The board of directors also just recently authorized a new program upon the sale of the nutrition business to repurchase up to 10 billion of our shares over time. We now expect to complete the sale of nutrition business to Nestl\u00e9 in the next few months.","Finally, we expect to return more than $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2012.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thanks for the review, Frank. At this point, operator, if we could please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Ian and Frank, a question for you both. If you could give us some granularity and color on what the revenue outlook for this company might look like 2013 and beyond? Obviously, 2012 we were in the teeth of patent expirations with the Lipitor LOE but how should we think about directionally revenue outlook going forward? And just also to follow-up on tofa, Ian, you said you expected the FDA to a act on or before the PDUFA date, can you share with us your expectations for what kind of label you might receive? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, Jami. Well, revenue outlook \u2013 I\u2019ll make a few comments and then let Frank add anything he wants to and I\u2019ll ask Geno to answer on the tofa question. The peak year of patent expiration for us as far as we can see is 2012 \u2013 approximately 8 billion. Subsequent to that 2013, 2014 and 2015 will continue to be faced with LOEs and alliance revenue losses. They will be substantially lower than that \u2013 probably a peak of 4 billion in one of the years but between 3.5 and four in the subsequent three years. Still subject to alterations and fluctuations as patents expire.","So countering that of course we will have in line growth from our patent products with emerging market growth. We\u2019ll have the launch we expect of tofacitinib and Eliquis and we expect to also have the launch of adult vaccine. So those are the two currents I would say that would be affecting our revenue over those years. So, Frank, do you want to add anything to that?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","I would simply add that in addition to everything Ian said we will also continue to manage our cost structure and we will continue to do share repurchases and all those things will lead to steady, consistent earnings growth over time.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Geno, on tofa?","Geno Germano","Yeah, just a couple comments on tofa. We\u2019re nearing I think the end of the review process. We do expect that we\u2019ll have an action by the PDUFA date this month. And with regard to the expectations I think you know we have a very robust data set behind tofa with five large pivotal trials showing a good advocacy and safety in both the pre-TNF and post-TNF setting. We think that the results that we\u2019ve seen across this broad range of trials and broad range of patient types showed very consistent response and we\u2019re expecting to have a competitive label.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Geno. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Ian, you had mentioned this earlier about all strategic options being on the table for Pfizer. So last year in July of 2011, you disavowed splitting up the drug side of the business when you give your strategic update. That language in 2012 has changed subtly and I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide any more specifics on potentially splitting up the drug side? So what can that look like look? What could the structure be and importantly, when would we hear more? And then on tofacitinib, if I can just ask one question. Do you expect you will give up to five mg and 10 mg doses approved on the first go around?","Ian Read","Okay. Well, I\u2019ll take the overall company question and then I\u2019ll ask Geno to reply on tofa. So, I think I\u2019ve tried to be clear on this, as I see putting consumer to one side which fits with the either of the other two remaining businesses, I see us as having two businesses going forward once we finish. If we do complete the separation of nutritional and animal health. I see us having a growth business or innovated business which is fueled by the pipeline that I discussed earlier in my comments today and then I see a value business which is depending on post-LOE or pari-LOE products, very broad geographic capabilities, large capabilities in reimbursement and managing the global business.","So those two businesses I think are core businesses for us. We will, we already have in the develop market, separated those businesses out so we do have an innovative business and an established products business which equates roughly to those two segments. And in emerging markets, we continue to manage them as country organizations. Now, once we get through the changes of animal health and nutritional, we will continue to look at how to best structure those two businesses so they can maximize the value to Pfizer. Geno, do you want to comment?","Geno Germano","Yeah, sure, Tim. Regarding the five and 10, as you know, in all five of the pivotal trials that we conducted we tested both the 5 mg and the 10 mg doses. Again, the results were very consistent across the board, across the patient types in the trials that were done. We believe that the benefit risk is favorable for both the five mg and the 10 mg and at this point in our discussions with the FDA we\u2019re not going to comment any further on what we expect the final outcome to be.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Geno.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I could just first build on Tim\u2019s question. Will you report out separately at any point in the next year or so the established products P&L versus the branded products P&L? So, not breaking the company up but just giving us more disclosure in the Ks and the Qs around those business operations? And then I had a question if I may for Dolsten, for Mikael Dolsten, sorry. I was wondering if he could update us just on timelines, make sure everything is on track for the Prevnar capita trial and also bring us up to speed on the mening B and Staph vaccine programs. Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay. I\u2019m going to ask Frank to answer the question on the reporting structure and then Mikael, if you could take those other questions on the capita trial.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So on reporting, we provide revenue detailed today by individual business units. So in charts that I walked through, there\u2019s clearly revenue detailed by business unit. In terms of beyond revenue detail, I think the way to think about this is, the established products business has lower gross margins than the traditional pharmaceutical businesses but has comparable operating margins because it requires less expenses which is something that we\u2019ve talked about previously. And going forward, we\u2019ll do what we always do, which is see where there are opportunities to improve the transparency of the company and to the extent that we see those opportunities to be more transparent we will incorporate those into our external reporting.","Ian Read","Thank you, Frank. Mikael, if you\u2019re on. Thank you.","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you for your interest in our vaccine pipeline. The Prevnar capita trial is an event and pending the seasonality and severity of the immune, often treated by cold and flu seasons. We have in our projections that capita may have sufficient events due in 2013 to allow us to aggregate data during the latter part of that year. Mening B has gone through very productive dialogues with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe and we anticipate starting and plan to start before the end of this year. Staff Aureus contains two studies that are in Phase 2 with a readout during next year.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks, and good morning. Two housekeeping questions and one R&D question, please. What were the sales for Xalkori and Inlyta? And second, if you look at Sutent, could we argue that it might be slowing if you simply look at it sequentially? Has it totally maxed its potential? And then for Dr. Dolsten, an earlier stage product in PCSK9, Pfizer seems to be a little bit behind at least two competitors given that Phase 2B just started from a dosing perspective and will not complete until next year, suggesting the Phase 3 trial would not necessarily start up until sometime later next year or even later than that. And the question really is how would you envision this emerging is a year behind, not that big of a deal, and more importantly do you think that there is a unique characteristic for your molecule that may be different from others? Thank you very much.","Ian Read","Thank you, Tony. Frank, could you address the sales of Xalkori and Inlyta? Perhaps Geno wants to comment on Sutent and then I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on PCSK9 and ask Mikael comment further.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Sure, so on Xalkori, revenues for the third quarter almost 40 million, for Inlyta revenues for the third quarter were almost 30 million, so approximately 40 million and approximately 30 million for those two drugs respectively.","Geno Germano","Yeah, and for Sutent, Sutent it is doing very well; it remains the number one choice in first-line metastatic RCC and frankly, it\u2019s showing a lot of durability. So we\u2019re looking forward to continuing our leadership position in RCC now with Sutent, Inlyta and Toracel, it\u2019s a real strong franchise for us.","Ian Read","Thank you. On Xalkori, the testing has gone up from 11% I think at the beginning of year now to 55% which is very encouraging because that required a change in physician practice and if that occurs, it makes us more optimistic about the potential for Xalkori going forward and of course, we now have the launch coming in Europe. On PCSK9, yeah, I believe that we may be potentially a little behind some of our competitors. It really is an issue of, as you say, the differentiation and if we don\u2019t have a first in class do we believe we potentially have a best in class asset? And clearly, the development of this asset has several strategic options. Mikael, do you want to add anything on the science of that?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, let me add a few words. We are very excited about this drug class. We think there may be differences between antibodies in the performance in the immunities and in the dosing regimen and it\u2019s important to have the optimal dose regimen to allow sustained relevant cholesterol levels in a convenient manner to be accomplished.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Next question, please, operator?","Operator","The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Two pipeline questions; the first is specific. I\u2019m hoping to better understand the meningococcal B development program. As I see it on clinicaltrials.gov, you\u2019re running a Phase 3 safety study involving 7,500 patients and since it has the word safety in the title, I\u2019m assuming that the drug or the vaccine cannot be filed after that trial, that there will need to be additional Phase 3 trial work, but I may be wrong. So just wondering if that trial successfully concludes, can you file or do you need to do a additional Phase 3 work? Then the second question is, for Mikael Dolsten. Mikael, can you just highlight the key Phase 2 product readouts that we should be watching in the next 12 to 18 months? Besides the PCSK9 which you\u2019ve already discussed. Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, David. Mikael, could you handle the mening B question and then also address the pipeline?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, so in the mening B program it\u2019s correct \u2013 we have a safety study ongoing. But we\u2019re planning this year to start and also early next year several other studies that include large efficacy studies and different batch lot consistency studies and potentially can comment on vaccine studies. So it will be a broad program that will be aimed to show effectiveness to raise relevant immune responses and applicability for young and adolescent patients to use the vaccine.","When it comes to the pipeline, what should be the next wave to watch? So let me briefly mention some ten key opportunities for 4Q to carry us. In oncology, I would mention dacomitinib for non-smoker lung cancer, Inotuzumab for basic malignancies and PD9 and 1 \u2013 our exciting CDK inhibitor for advanced breast cancer. We are planning to present Phase 2 data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.","In vaccines we already spoke about mening B vaccine and the Staff Aureus vaccine which we\u2019ll have a few C readout during next year. Tofacitinib is of course the flagship in our immunology therapeutic area with a portfolio of opportunities beyond RA. We are in a Phase 3 for psoriasis and also is collective with studying additional indication in Phase 2 including Crohn and we\u2019re supplementing our inflammatory bowel disease activity with PUC studies for med cam and aisle 6 antibodies which we have readouts in the next 12 to 18 months. The aisle 6 antibody will have utility and there is a PUC study ongoing in lupus.","And finally, in the cardiovascular metabolic area in addition to PCSK9 we also have an exciting pancreatic acting glucokinase drug. So as you can see I have selected some key opportunities of a very rich and diverse pipeline of some 90 projects. Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael. I would add to that, that the \u2013 clearly we started the safety program mening B because those trials take longer than the efficacy programs and clearly as we started our Phase 3 trials we now have an agreed-upon development program with the FDA that we believe will lead to approval.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott \u2013 JP Morgan","Just couple here. First, emerging market growth \u2013 it looks like it\u2019s about 10% year-to-date \u2013 year-over-year growth. Obviously a nice step up over the 2011 results. But just interested in your thoughts on the longer-term growth opportunity in these markets? Do you think you can sustain low double-digit growth in the emerging markets over time or has enough changed in the macro environment where that\u2019s no longer a reasonable target?","Second question was on the commercial opportunity Eliquis. Just any thoughts on your expectations for the label you might receive there and how you\u2019re thinking about that market and how it\u2019s evolved so far with your competitors? And then finally can you give an update on this data is of Remoxy in beta? Just how we should be thinking about those? Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask Olivier to comment on emerging market growth potential and then John Young will do Eliquis and Remoxy.","Olivier Brandicourt","Chris, yeah, we think we can continue to perform in line with our goals of high single digit growth over the period. The macro trends continue to be favorable with increased amount of spending on healthcare and the pharmaceutical market which is growing at 12%to 15% in the next few years. So again, we think we can maintain the high single digit and again if you look at the 6% we achieved during the quarter it\u2019s very much influenced by the Prevnar and Amberal institutional sales to government. And if you take out that cadence you look at the base business during Q1 2012 we grew by 9%. The second quarter of 2012 and this quarter is still 11% percent. So all of that indicates that we have a pretty strong foundation and we can then continue to build on it.","Ian Read","Yeah, I would add also we\u2019re very pleased about the presence in the BRIC-MT markets with accelerated growth there and the strength of our organizations, we\u2019re the number one multinational in China, and we have impressive positions in the other BRIC-MT markets. So with that, John would you like to take the other questions?","John Young","Okay. Thanks for your questions, Chris. So let me take Eliquis first. And say obviously as you are aware as we announced previously on 26 September, the FDA acknowledged our receipt of the Eliquis NDA resubmission for our nonvalvular atrial fibrillation indication. The discussions between Pfizer and BMS and the FDA are ongoing. We continue to work closely with them. And as you know, the target date for the FDA to complete their review is 17 March of 2013, which is when the PDUFA date occurs.","In terms of your question about do we see the potential? Clearly, we believe that Eliquis is differentiated from warfarin because it\u2019s demonstrated superior efficacy, bleeding on cores mortality compared to warfarin in a single dose. So we believe that we should have a compelling profile with cardiologists as well as primary care physicians, and we are working very closely with our partners BMS to finalize this strategy and plans and make sure that we are very well prepared for launch.","So if I turn now to Remoxy and Embetta, first of all, we meant with the FDA in May of this year to discuss our proposal for reintroduction of Embetta to the market. The required stability programs are under way, and we anticipate a submission of a prior approval supplement in the first half of 2013.","If I turn to Remoxy, as you probably know from previous calls, Remoxy has been a challenging asset that our teams have been working on very diligently since the acquisition of King. As a result of that work, the \u2013 and extensive insights that we\u2019ve gained around the formulation, we\u2019ve initiated complementary by availability studies to assess the pharmakinetic or PK profile of modified Remoxy formulation compositions. And we expect those studies to read out early in 2013. We think that the results of those studies will provide us a much greater clarity on whether or not we\u2019ll be able to adequately address the questions raised in the complete response letter that we received from the FDA.","So we\u2019re targeting a late March meeting with the FDA to discuss those outputs and agree on a net go or no-go decision. I think one last comment just to make is that I think it\u2019s important to remember that our commitment to this area is very strong, and as such we continue to invest in our compound ALO-02, which is an extended release oxycodone, which uses an altraxon platform technology and it\u2019s currently in Phase III.","Ian Read","Thank you, John.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, John. Operator, our the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen & Co.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","Frank, would you dissect the strength in gross profit margin? How much was currency? How much were efficiencies? And how much was mix? And also how much of the narrowing of the range in sales and EPS guidance for the year is due to adverse currency fluctuations? And then one for Dr. Dolsten, what is your postmortem on the Bapineuzumab? Was that it flood molecule? Did you study the wrong patients? Or is the mechanism in your view unlikely to be effective? Thank you.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So let me hit the two questions you asked me, Steve. So first on efficiencies, foreign exchange relative to the quarter, let me run the numbers, which is if you look at our total adjusted cost for the quarter, they were down \u2013 and this includes cost of goods sold, SI&A and R&D, they were down $1.3 billion. So from $9.5 billion last year to $8.2 billion this year, foreign exchange helped that by $440 million. So if you take the $1.3 billion, subtract $440 million, you get roughly $850 million. That was down 8% operationally. If you also add back or adjust for the Nexium payment that we made, that 8% becomes 11%, which Ian had mentioned in his opening remarks.","In terms of foreign exchange to the bottom line, foreign exchange hurt the quarter by $0.02. And by the way in terms of rhythm of the numbers, if you look last year in Q3, it actually hurt \u2013 it actually helped Q3 by 4% \u2013 $0.04. It was a $0.04 good guy last quarter, $0.02 bad guy this quarter. In terms of the revenue guidance, the updated guidance is within the guidance we provided for the year. We had set 58 to 60, we tightened it this quarter, left the lower end of the range and then lowered the top end of the range from 60 to 59. That decrease, if you look the midpoint to midpoint, is really primarily driven by foreign exchange.","You can\u2019t just look at the euro, which is typically what we do, and that\u2019s a big piece of our revenues, about 18% of our revenues are euro dominated. But the yen and the Brazilian real have really been moving against us quite frankly since the beginning of the year. The real more recently. And then when we tighten the range, it has a more pronounced effect, which is why we lowered the range from 58 to 60 to 58 to 69. So the short answer is, foreign exchange is the driver relative to our revenue guidance.","Ian Read","Thank you, Frank. And within the euro being roughly 18% of our sales, the yen represents 10% and the real represents 4%, so basically, while traditionally people just look at the euro, you\u2019ve got a look at that mix to model the impact of exchange on Pfizer. I\u2019m going to ask Olivier to answer the question on bapi and then I\u2019ll Mikael Dolsten to add anything if he thinks he wants to do that after Olivier\u2019s comments.","Mikael Dolsten","All right. Steve, so we are currently closing out the bapi program as you know. We have not seen any evidence of clinical activity in any of the relevant sub-population we study. We reported results earlier in October and as we speak, at the clinical trial AD meeting this week in Monte Carlo. And the only study which is remaining with bapi is a sub-Q formulation study which is called the Summit AD. It\u2019s actually fully enrolled at this point and we are expecting to see the results during the first quarter of 2013. I\u2019d like to mention that it is only a biomarker study, it is not an efficacy or safety study at this point.","So the alliance is going to look at all the biomarker analysis we have not only coming from what we have already. But an additional two product SCC01 and also BOO3 and that information will actually inform our future work regarding potential for promo AD with any of those candidates which we have in our pipeline. So we continue to believe in the btime pathway and are committed to research in AD and to that point I would like to ask Mikael eventually to mention a few.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","I would assume anything you say would be speculation, but go ahead.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","I think Olivier summarized it in an excellent manner and we do continue as many in the field believe that effective intervention with Amyloid formation at the early stage of the disease is a valued way forward to explore. We have a broad AD pipeline with both disease-modifying and systematic approaches. Let me mention our Sam 765 HT6 antagonist that has completed phase 1 and is considered for further studies. We have other ways to interfere with Amyloid formation such as base and gamma secretive inhibitors in late pre-clinical and as Olivier mentioned, we are assessing different antibody approaches to modulate the base Amyloid and this reflects our continued interest to research in inflammatory disease.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann","I have a question. Wondering can we get a little bit more color on how we should be thinking about the growth drivers of Prevnar 13 particularly in the pediatric indications going forward? What percentage of NIP\u2019s are now kind of filled given the fact that we are seeing this slowdown in the U.S.? And separately, as we think about some of the 2013 phase 2 catalysts, Mikael, maybe you could give us a little bit of your thoughts on the catalysts that you are most focused on? I think historically, there has been talk about IO. I guess that\u2019s the Inotuzumab product for the antibody drug conjugate as well as dacomitinib on the oncology side. Those are two that jump out at me. Thanks a lot.","Ian Read","Okay, Geno. Would you like to comment on the play between pediatric and adult and then Mikael will comment on the 13.","Geno Germano","I think with Prevnar pediatric, we\u2019re seeing now is primarily the effect of the success that we had with the catch-up opportunity where we added over $1 billion of value to the company by taking full advantage of the catch up opportunity when we introduced the 13 and now we\u2019re reaching a point where it\u2019s the base birth cohort that is driving the pediatric business. We have very strong NIP performance across most of the developed world.","We are still growing in Japan and I think future growth for the pediatric business will come from growth in emerging markets and in markets where we haven\u2019t introduced the thirteenth Valent yet which would included Japan and China. And in the U.S. you get a little bit from price each year but it\u2019s fundamentally a strong base of business that we think we can grow to some extent but probably not dramatically in the developed markets. The growth opportunity truly comes from the adult business.","As you know, without the formal recommendations in place yet the adult business is slow to develop. In the U.S. we\u2019ve recently gotten an ASIC recommendation for immuno-compromised patients and CDC has indicated that they will make Prevnar a recommended vaccine as part of the hospital quality measures. These are things that will help bring attention to the use of the conjugate vaccine in the adult population. But we think the real lift and the real big opportunity for growth in the franchise comes when we have a broader set of recommendations from the major recommending bodies around the world which will occur post-capita.","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, so left on the line are a couple interesting conferences end of this year already with data starting with the ACR Rheumatology Conference where we will have several abstract on tofacitinib including the oral start study on structure end point in pre-metatrecsate treated patients. American Heart Association \u2013 we will have P59 and also sub analysis from Eliquis studies.","I briefly mentions San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. We will report the Phase 2 data from CDK in advanced breast cancer. As you mentioned dacomitinib \u2013 we will have two Phase 3 studies that are expected to be presented at the conference in 2013. We will also show a final analysis at relevant medical conference in 2013 on inlighta and we will continue to generate important data on tofacitinib in psoriasis and as John Young mentioned ALO2, our oxycodone abuse deterrent compound.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","And next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, can you just comment on your review regarding M&A opportunities out there? Does this authorization of a new share repurchase program imply any view from you \u2013 any change in view on the attractiveness of bolt on opportunities and acquisitions that may or may not be out there?","Secondly, the cost savings does appear to be running somewhat ahead of \u2013 at least our expectations. I\u2019m wondering if it is from your point of view just faster delivery than you may have originally anticipated or do you think you can go beyond what you have previously guided in terms of cost-saving and efficiencies within the business. And then just lastly, I wonder if you could make some sort of comment about the tax rate beyond this year. Appears you may be seeing some structural mix changes in your tax rate. If you could talk a little bit about that in terms of a Q3 or (inaudible) tax rate? Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay. Thank you for the questions, Jeff. On the bolt on opportunities we don\u2019t seeing that the increased authorization for buybacks in any way diminishes our ability to do bolt on M&A transactions if we find cases that can be share buyback. And I\u2019d ask Frank a little bit about the cost savings and tax rate.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Yeah, so on the tax rate \u2013 we reiterated our guidance for the year approximately 29%. I think going forward with all the uncertainty around tax reform we should assume 29% and the one thing I\u2019ll say is relative to tax reform we support any tax reform that will enhance the global competitive of U.S. companies that are operating internationally. But I think going forward given the uncertainty around this we\u2019ll continue to assume approximately 29%.","In terms of the cost savings, I think the way I\u2019ll answer this is almost in terms of what inning we\u2019re in relative to a baseball game. So if you think about a nine inning game we\u2019re clearly not in the early innings. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the late innings. I think we\u2019re toward the end of the middle innings. So there\u2019s still opportunity but clearly the absolute size of the opportunity isn\u2019t what the size of the opportunity was a few years ago given the billions of dollars we\u2019ve already taken out of our cost structure.","Ian Read","Yeah, I would say the changes going forward \u2013 if it ever was easy some of the targets \u2013 the more obvious targets have already been taken care of and now it\u2019s going to be cost reductions or increased efficiencies going to be coming from exactly that. Looking at business models and structure, and as Frank said, the targets that were there available, have been hit and taken care of. So, with that, I think we\u2019ll move on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arphe from BMO.","Alex Arphe \u2013 BMO","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, Enbrel and other TNF seemed to be little weaker in Europe this quarter. We\u2019ve heard about cost containment measures focused on TNF. To what extent do you see this as an opportunity for tofa as a potentially cheaper option that has similar efficacy? And as a follow-up, the Animal Health business was a little bit lighter operationally compared to what we\u2019ve seen with some of your peers. Is there anything that was unique to this quarter that we should be aware of? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you. Geno, if you could do Enbrel and then Frank if you\u2019d like to answer Animal Health.","Geno Germano","Sure. I think that the TNF inhibitors and frankly the whole pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced some challenge with cost-containment measures in Europe. Our TNF business has been impacted more in the southern European countries than in the North but there is some effect there. The volume growth remains fairly strong so I think the place for TNF inhibitors is relatively secure. In terms of tofa, we will announce our pricing strategy once we have approval and we\u2019re ready to introduce the product.","Ian Read","Thank you.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","On Animal Health, let me run the numbers then I\u2019ll give a little color-commentary. To your point Alex, the quarter year-to-date growth was 4% but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis the operating growth was 6%. S we\u2019ll will get some volatility quarter-to-quarter but on nine-month, year-to-date basis 6%. If you drill down a little bit we see increased demand across the global livestock portfolio, increased demand across the companion-animal portfolio and increased demand in certain key geographies and I think the watch items are clearly the drought in the U.S., Midwest and Southwest and just what\u2019s going on in Europe in particular southern Europe relative to the economy but net, net, year-to-date basis 6% operating growth which we view as nice for that business.","Alex Arphe \u2013 BMO","Thank you, Frank.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Damian Canover from Morningstar.","Damian Canover \u2013 Morningstar","Great. Thanks for taking the question, most of my questions have been asked but just wanted to follow up on the management of the cost structure and continuing the baseball analogy, it depends I guess when you start the analogy but you look at towards the end of middle innings it might suggest anywhere in the neighborhood of one to two billion in annual cost savings still to be pulled out from Pfizer. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe characterize where that number fits in the scheme.","And also when you look at managing the cost structure are you largely balancing costs that could be saved from products losing exclusivity versus costs that will be needed to launch new products? And then just lastly, I was wondering if you could comment on the variable costs porting Celebrex. Thank you.","Ian Read","When we look at our costs, you obviously look at a company that has grown by acquisitions which has allowed us to take out costs as we do the acquisitions. If you look at our global position and we carefully analyze what is our share of voice and what is our share of mind against competitors and we analyze that in the context of an industry that is in itself restructuring and faced with headwinds on pricing and access so that the spend you need up in the marketplace depends to a large extent on the competitive set you\u2019re against.","So we tend to look at the spending of our competitors and what we need to do to remain competitive as a benchmark. I want to be clear here that we are looking t costs always with a view to remaining competitive in the marketplace. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?","Geno Germano","Maybe I\u2019ll give a little sub-ledger detail relative to what I said relative to where we are and then some of the opportunities going forward. First, if you think about manufacturing, we said, I\u2019ve said previously we still have, give or take about 10 manufacturing facilities that we plan to exit over the next several years in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland, 10 manufacturing facilities. That obviously represents a significant opportunity.","We continue to streamline our corporate center and enabling function services. We continue to believe there\u2019s additional opportunities there and we are looking at all of our functions, everything we do in terms of where are there opportunities to be more efficient, more productive we\u2019ve been doing that, we\u2019ll continue to do that. But those are some of the opportunity areas relative to what we can do on a going-forward basis and why I said where we are relative to the continuum.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","We don\u2019t really release variable or fixed cost around individual products for competitive reasons. Thank you.","Chuck Triano","Operator, if we could take one more question, please?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mark Goodman from UBS.","Ian Read","Hello, Mark.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Hi. Ian, in the past you\u2019ve talked about cost cutting in Europe and how you are really focused on taking more cost out of Europe and changing the business model a little bit. I was wondering if you were prepared to talk about that little bit. And then the second question is on gross margin. Once we eliminate these 10 plants and once we get through a couple more years of patent expiries, what is the sustainable gross margin? All we still around 80%?","Ian Read","Okay. The opportunities in Europe of course center around, as the European Union moves towards a more centralized retrograde environment, what do you need to do on a country by country basis to maintain a commercially competitive organization and what you need to do to maintain your marketing and medical and the infrastructure?","And It\u2019s easy to compare Europe with the U.S., which is a lot simpler, because it\u2019s federal and it\u2019s one regulation but as Europe moves towards that and we tend to look at the treatment of Europe while not identical but more similar to a structure you would have in the U.S. but I would ask John Young if he wants to add anything to that as he\u2019s been managing, previously managing Europe for some considerable time.","Geno Germano","The only add I would give is that obviously as we do in all of our regions in all of our businesses around the world, one of the things that we will continue to do is to make sure that we deploy our resources in line with the opportunity to generate revenue growth and value for shareholders. That is something that we\u2019ve been doing very actively, as you know over the last three to four years. And in line with the continued evolution, the pipeline will continue to deploy resources appropriately in Europe to maximize shareholder value as the portfolio continues to evolve.","Ian Read","Thank you. Frank, do you want to try to answer the gross margin question?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Sure. So I think clearly there\u2019ll be downward pressure on our gross margin on a going forward basis when you think about how the mix of our revenues is changing but I think the thing to focus on is our operating margins. We can continue to generate cost reduction and productivity improvements to keep the operating margin relatively constant on a going forward basis.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank, and thank you, everybody, for being flexible with the date change, and thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Pfizer\u2019s Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Essential Health; John Young, Group President, Pfizer Innovative Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com\/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2017 annual report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the original date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.","During our call, we will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Form 8-K dated today, October 30, 2018.","Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","Ian, Albert, and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making within each of our businesses and the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline. I will then ask Albert to discuss some of the steps we are taking to prepare the company to accelerate top line growth in the future.","In the third quarter, total company revenues were up 2% operationally, driven by a continued strength of key brands, biosimilars, and emerging markets. These growth drivers were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a decline in U.S. Legacy Established Products, driven by industry-wide pricing challenges, as well as product supply shortages and associated inventory reduction related to our legacy Hospira products.","I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 5% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines.","We remain very pleased with the performance of Ibrance, which has solidified its leadership position in the CDK 4\/6 inhibitor class in the U.S., holding at just under a 90% share in terms of new prescription volume. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains the international markets, particularly across Europe and Japan. And we had another quarter of solid growth there.","For Xtandi, alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 5% over the second quarter and a 20% year-over-year growth. We are seeing an increased number of urologists prescribing it.","There are positive early indicators with our PROSPER launch in the U.S. following the July approval, which made Xtandi the first and only FDA approved oral medication for both nonmetastatic and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.","And the European Commission has very recently approved Xtandi for the treatment of adult men with high risk nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, based on the PROSPER study data.","Eliquis continues to perform well. Pfizer's revenues for Eliquis were up 36% operationally to nearly $900 million. And it continues to maintain a strong leadership position in the NOAC class. Eliquis also overtook wore Warfarin to become the number one in OAC total brand, total prescription share in the U.S.","Xeljanz also continues to perform well with revenue up 26% operationally. This was bolstered by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis revenues and some early contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.","Xeljanz scripts were up 31% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The main reason for the disconnect this quarter between volume growth and revenue growth in the U.S. market is that higher prescription demand was partially offset by a one-time year-to-date true-up in the quarter for access payments with one customer.","Sales of Prevnar 13 were up 12% in the U.S., largely due to the timing of government purchases. Sales were up 14% operationally in the emerging markets, driven by growth in the pediatric business, strong Gavi performance, and the 2017 launch in China.","Finally, our Consumer Healthcare business posted strong growth internationally, while U.S. revenues were down slightly due to the LOE impact of Nexium 24HR, we continue to review options and expect a decision regarding strategic alternatives for this business will be made by the end of the calendar year.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. We once again saw strong operational growth in emerging markets and in biosimilars. Overall, Essential Health revenues for the quarter declined, however, due in large part to the ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, continuing product LOEs, namely Lyrica in developed Europe, and a decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets.","Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 11% operationally for the quarter, primarily reflecting growth across the Legacy Established Products and sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio in China.","Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 46% operationally in developed markets during the quarter, driven primarily by continued growth for Inflectra in certain U.S. channels as well as in developed Europe.","We continue to bring new biosimilars to the market and began shipping Nivestim, a biosimilar to Neupogen. to wholesalers in the U.S. at the end of September.","In our U.S. sterile injectables business, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top line. We expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019. And we continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.","We continue to strengthen and advance our R&D pipeline. Let me touch on some of our more promising recent developments.","In Rare Diseases, our tafamidis Phase 3 ATTR-ACT study results were very positive. The data showed that tafamidis significantly reduced a combination of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR-CM. Given the nature of this disease, the exact prevalence is currently unknown, though we estimate less than 1% of the patients have been diagnosed.","There currently are no approved treatments for ATTR-CM, making it a tremendously underserved market. Tafamidis holds the fast track and breakthrough therapy designations. And we plan a rolling submission for ATTR-CM with a formal NDA being submitted during the current quarter.","In Internal Medicine, along with our partners Eli Lilly, recently presented positive results for our tanezumab Study 1056 at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. This was the first readout of the tanezumab global clinical development program. Additional Phase 3 readouts, which will more fully characterize tanezumab's clinical profile, are expected in the first half of 2019.","In Oncology, the FDA recently approved two of our innovative medicines. In September, we received approval for Vizimpro, or dacomitinib, for first line treatment of patients with EGFR mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Earlier this month, we received approval for Talzenna, or talazoparib, for the treatment of the most common types of a rare-to-treat breast cancer.","Two other Oncology candidates, lorlatinib and glasdegib, are under priority review with the FDA. We expect to receive decisions for both before the end of the year.","We also recently presented at ESMO Phase 3 data for Bavencio plus Inlyta for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. We're excited about this potential opportunity. And we've been discussing these interim results with regulators to determine an appropriate path forward.","We are also encouraged by other recent data reinforcing Inlyta as the TKI of choice in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for this condition.","In Inflammation and Immunology, two of our JAK inhibitors have received breakthrough designations this year, our JAK1 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and our JAK3 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata, an immune disease that currently has no approved treatments. The JAK1 candidate is now being studied across four Phase 3 trials that are actively recruiting. The JAK3 candidate has been advanced to Phase 2b\/3 trial, which will start in the upcoming months for alopecia areata.","In Vaccines, we announced in September that our 20-valiant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S.A. FDA. We expect to start Phase 3 trials in a few months.","Our Phase 3 Clover study in C. Difficile continues to enroll ahead of schedule and is now 88% enrolled with more than 14,000 subjects. We believe we remain positioned to have a potential first-in-class vaccine for this infection.","We are advancing a Phase 2 tetravalent vaccine candidate for Staphylococcus aureus with fast track designation. And we are in discussions with the FDA to potentially expand the study to become a Phase 3 pivotal study.","Overall, we continue to see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals through 2022, of which up to half have the potential to be blockbusters.","We're also working to ensure these medicines will be launched in an environment where they can help the maximum number of people who need them. We continue to work with the President on his blueprint for strengthening the health care system, providing more access, and relieving the burden on patients at the point of sale.","For example, we recently responded to the administration's request for information on reviving the competitive acquisition program in Medicare Part B. We are supportive of developing a market-based alternative to the current buy and bill system, one that includes voluntary participation by physicians and robust competition facilitated by many vendors, not just one or two PDMs (13:07).","In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well positioned to deliver new medicines for patients, prepare the company for accelerated growth in the future, and create enhanced shareholder value. In fact, we have continued to repurchase our shares over the past few months, as we believe our shares remain undervalued.","Earlier this month, we announced that Albert Bourla will succeed me as CEO on January 1. Albert's extensive knowledge of our business, firm grasp of the issues, and deep caring for patients will help Pfizer continue to build on the outstanding foundations we have put in place. And I am confident that he is putting in place a structure and leadership team that will maximize the company's growth opportunities.","Now I will turn it over to Albert, who will share some thoughts about what he will be focusing on when he assumes the role of CEO. Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. After prolonged periods of revenue decline and then stability, due to significant and unprecedented loss of exclusivity impacts, Pfizer is preparing for what we expect to be an era of sustained growth, following the impact of the Lyrica LOE that will negatively impact our growth in the next two years.","We now have a wide range of opportunities to continue to grow our core brands and a strong, deep R&D pipeline that has become a competitive advantage. Taken together, this provides us with important breadth both in terms of in-market and future opportunities. We are working quickly to make the natural adjustments that are needed when a company pivots to grow. And we have already begun this evolution.","As you know, back in the summer we announced that we will be organizing the company into three businesses. We believe each will be well positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities, driven by the evolving and unique dynamics of their individual markets.","Our science-based Innovative Medicines business will be our primary and most substantial business. We believe our growth prospects in this segment are strong. And Pfizer is well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years.","In order to maximize this unique opportunity, we need to make the right capital allocation decisions to drive both scientific and commercial innovation. As our pipeline matures, with the progression of current and the initiation of new pivotal trials, we will need to increase our R&D investments. And as our pipeline potentially delivers new commercialization opportunities, we will need to increase our investments in new market creation activities.","To partially offset these incremental cost increases, we will generate cost reduction opportunities, particularly in indirect SI&A. We are taking steps to simplify the organization, increase spans of control, and reduce organizational layers. By doing so, we expect not only to generate partially offsetting savings, but, more importantly, to reduce bureaucracy and expedite decision making.","We believe that our Established Medicines business, which will include the majority of our off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, has the potential to generate sustainable modest revenue growth. Urbanization in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, is creating additional access opportunities for these medicines for hundreds of millions of people.","As the leading pharmaceutical company in Asia, and particularly in China, we believe we are well positioned to be a leader in this significant and rapidly growing market. We currently are focused on standing up this organization, enhancing its autonomy, and positioning to operate as a true stand-alone division within Pfizer.","Finally, with an increasing focus on healthy living, patients are seeking wellness and prevention solutions that are easier to access over the counter. With a strong portfolio of global brands that span health and wellness, our Consumer Healthcare business is well positioned to continue its growth. As Ian said, we continue exploring options for this business, and we expect to make a decision by year-end.","Earlier this month, we announced changes to the executive leadership team. These adjustments were designed to create a more effective structure that further strengthens our ability to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients.","As a result of a smooth and very thoughtful succession process, when we transition leadership on January 1, we will have in place a clear strategy, a new organization, and a strong executive team.","Today, we believe that we have the best pipeline in our history. To ensure we capitalize this incredible opportunity, we must remain highly focused on successful execution. In this context, I would reiterate that we continue not to see the need for any large-scale M&A activity at this time.","Under Ian's leadership, we have set the right course. As a result, we have an opportunity over the next 5 to 10 years to have a profound impact on patients and global health, with the benefits of this impact extending to shareholders and other stakeholders.","I look forward to working with my mentor Ian in his new capacity as Executive Chairman, with the board, and with my leadership team to lead Pfizer in this new era and, of course, to working more closely with all of you in my new role.","Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarterly financials and our financial outlook for 2018.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials.","Third quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $13.3 billion, which reflects operational growth of $243 million or 2%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, $113 million or 1%.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by Eliquis and Xeljanz globally, Ibrance in international markets, and Prevnar 13 and Xtandi in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and decreased revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, mainly due to continued biosimilar competition.","Revenues for our Essential Health business in the third quarter decreased 4% operationally, primarily due to a 14% operational decline in Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets, driven by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition, and a 9% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S., all of which were partially offset mainly by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada, 11% operational growth in emerging markets, primarily reflecting growth in the Legacy Established Products and sterile injectables portfolios in China, and a 46% operational growth in biosimilars in developed markets, mainly driven by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. and in developed Europe.","Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.69, compared with $0.47 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, higher other income, and higher revenues.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.78 versus $0.67 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues, higher other income, and foreign exchange. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 54 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $113 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $236 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted third quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter.","As you can see, we narrowed our 2018 revenue guidance range to $53 billion to $53.7 billion, reducing the midpoint by $650 million, which was largely related to lower-than-anticipated Essential Health revenues, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira sterile injectable product shortages in the U.S. and recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.","In addition, we now expect adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 20.8% to 21.3%, adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $14 billion to $14.5 billion, adjusted other income to be approximately $1.3 billion, and the adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.02 per share, the midpoint of which hasn't changed, implying 13% growth year over year.","This guidance assumes anticipated share repurchases of approximately $12 billion in 2018, of which $9 billion has been completed to date. As of today, we have $7.4 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.","Our 2018 guidance for R&D expenses and effective tax rate on adjusted income did not change. We continue to expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion, and the effective tax rate to be approximately 16%.","Turning to other income, I'd like to provide some additional commentary. First, the increase in guidance was mainly due to two factors, increased income from collaborations, licensing agreements, and milestone payments; and to a lesser extent, further realized gains on equity securities through the end of the third quarter 2018. It's important to note that other income will continue to be highly variable this year because of the new mark-to-market accounting changes for potential gains and losses on our equity ownership of ICU Medical and Allergene (25:11).","I also want to remind you that our current guidance for other income does not include a forecast for any further potential changes in value for our unrealized gains and losses on equity investments for the remainder of the year.","Looking forward to 2019, I want to give you the core components of other income deductions that we could reasonably estimate at this time to provide an anticipated baseline prior to the inclusion of newer one-time factors, such as market-to-market gains or losses.","Interest expense of approximately $1.5 billion, interest income of approximately $300 million, pension credit and other items of approximately $500 million, and royalty income from products such as Xtandi, neratinib and Prezista, as well as dividend income from our ViiV partnership, which are running at a combined annual rate of approximately $700 million.","At this point, the puts and takes of these core components net to a roughly flat starting point for 2019 versus our original expectations of $400 million for 2018. As has been our practice, we will provide our 2019 annual guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter financial results.","Moving on to key takeaways. We delivered solid financial results in the third quarter of 2018 with 2% operational revenue growth and a 16% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We updated and narrowed certain components of our 2018 financial guidance. The midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS range has not changed. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones.","We returned $15 billion to shareholders as of October 30, 2018, through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to return approximately $20 billion directly to shareholders this year. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Operator, at this point can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Oh, great. Thank you very much. Folks, you've now repeatedly mentioned steady growth prospects after 2020. I think you have characterized it as mid-single digits growth on the revenue side. What are the key growth drivers of that from your perspective? And I'm specifically interested in the ones that you think are not well appreciated by the Street, given your stock's current strong performance.","And then on tafamidis, our research suggests that we're starting to see more centers using this new nonbiopsy test for diagnosing patients. Given that reimbursement doesn't seem to be a barrier, I'm just wondering what are your expectations about potential improvement in the diagnosis rate? Do you see it as gradually improvement or \u2013 improving, or could we actually see a step-wise increase, given that doctors have a very good reason to actually identify these patients now? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Alex. I'll ask Albert to answer the question on the growth drivers post-2020. And then perhaps John will answer the question on tafamidis.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Alex. And as you know, beginning of the new financial year we have reorganized our company into three distinct business units, and each one of them has distinct growth drivers. So let me give you some idea of them.","In our primary and fundamental Innovative Medicines business, it is very clear that the driving forces are an aging population and our introduction of significant innovation. We have, as you know, 15 potential blockbusters in five years.","And they are \u2013 the ones that excite me the most, if I can pick just a few examples, we do have in Xtandi already launched the PROSPER and are expecting to present result for ARCHES, and which is another metastatic setting. We are very excited in immuno-oncology with our combinations with Inlyta and Bavencio. We are excited that we have launched, or we are expected to launch, four new molecular entities by the end of the year in oncology. Although they are smaller in size collectively, they inform (29:43) a blockbuster.","In our vaccines, we are very excited to continue working on Staph. aureus and our Clostridium difficile vaccines, as well as our next generation pneumococcal vaccines.","In inflammation, we have launched new indications for Xeljanz, particularly I think exciting, it is the UC indication that we have just launched. And we have pivotal studies that are running in what I think is one of the best JAK portfolio in the industry.","And of course, in the rare diseases, we are about to launch tafamidis. And in internal medicines we will hopefully launch, pending the data, tanezumab. So as you can see, there is significant of strength to drive the growth in this type of a business.","When it comes to the Established Medicines business, over there also we believe that we can have sustainable, modest low growth, but the drivers are very different over urbanization. At this time, right now, you see we have already 24% growth in China. This means $700 million we have generated more or less in nine months.","So the growth potential over there is substantial. And we will continue investing, particularly by relocating our management team and providing autonomy to this business to operate from China.","And last but not least, our Consumer business will continue growing based on the trends that existed with consumers.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John? Thank you, Albert.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks for the question, Alex. So let me just say we're obviously very excited about the opportunity that Vyndaqel presents to help patients. And the process of educating cardiologists on our data is underway.","ATTR-CM is significantly underdiagnosed. There's only about 1% of cases today detected prior to death. So it's a highly underdiagnosed disease.","Given that there are no approved treatment options today, the education of physicians and patients on what we would think of as red-flag symptoms and availability of the treatment itself will obviously play a big role improving disease awareness. And changes to treatment guidelines should also drive utilization over time.","To your point, diagnosing ATTR-CM has evolved significantly in recent years. Patients previously required a biopsy to confirm diagnosis. But now it's become much easier to diagnose patients using a non-invasive imaging technology called scintigraphy. There are around about 15,000 machines and 32 centers of excellence in the U.S. already using this technology. Training is not burdensome. And that is going to be a real focus of our activities as we bring this medicine to patients and to physicians sometime next year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So first one I guess is for Ian and Albert. Congrats, Albert, by the way on the new appointment. So the last quarter, Ian, you had mentioned you believed the administration has the intention of removing safe harbor for rebates. And that we're moving to a marketplace where we won't have rebates over time.","Over the last few weeks and months it feels like more of the commentary has been focused on potentially point of sale rebates and also obviously the reform around Part B. So I'm just wondering if you remain as confident as you were three months ago on the U.S. moving away from a system that's based on rebates?","And then my second question is just on Ibrance. And I know there's a lot of excitement and potential around the adjuvant opportunity if we look out a few years. But the growth in the midterm I think could be a little bit more challenging.","So I'm just wondering if you can give us some perspective on what's going to drive that product over the next couple years before we get the additional data in the adjuvant setting. Thanks so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, thank you, Vamil. I mean I think we're still waiting the guidance to come out from Secretary [Alex] Azar on the rebate situation. I do believe it continues to be a point of interest for the administration.","It is the most effective way that the administration can lower prices for patients at the point of purchase. I mean, discounts at the point of sale are also effective. They achieve the same thing. The mechanisms of achieving this lowering of prices for the patient could be varied. I still think the administration is focused on that.","The new Part B rule, or the new part \u2013 suggested rule in Part B is \u2013 I don't think it's in the best interest of patients to effectively enforce price controls from abroad into the U.S. And would hope that the administration would reconsider its position on that.","And in general, I still expect to see activity between now and the end of the year on rebates. With that, I'll pass it over to John to talk about Ibrance.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Vamil. So in terms of the growth trajectory for Ibrance, we have always viewed it as having three main phases.","Phase 1 was obviously the U.S. launch and maximizing the market opportunity there. Since launch in the U.S., we have entrenched Ibrance as the new standard of care. We've treated over 90,000 patients. So significant progress in the U.S.","Phase 2 has obviously been the international launch with particular focus in Europe and Japan. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made here since establishing reimbursement in the E.U. last year. Over 69,000 patients have already been prescribed Ibrance. And we continue to view that as being a growth driver for Ibrance over the years ahead.","The third phase to your point is yet to come, and that really represents the adjuvant or early breast cancer opportunity. And that could address a population roughly double the size of the current metastatic population. We're still a few years away from potentially entering this phase of growth, should our clinical trials be successful. But we are very excited and positive about the opportunity that that potentially represents for Ibrance in its life cycle.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just my first one was, based on some of the investment needs you highlighted in the opening comments, should we be thinking about margin erosion for Pfizer in 2019 and 2020 as Lyrica goes away? Or could some of those cost cuts offset those pressures? And then maybe longer term, is it fair to think about operating margin expansion returning in 2021 and beyond?","My second question was just on a higher level. Can you talk a little bit about the growth of both your sterile injectable and biosimilar businesses going forward, as we think about those moving over into the Innovative portfolio going forward? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Chris. I'll ask Frank to address the margin question. And then Angela to talk about the growth prospects of sterile injectables and biosimilars.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So, Chris, on the operating margin going forward, the way to think about this is, once we clear the Lyrica LOE, so think about that as the base year being 2020 when we get the full year effect of Lyrica LOE, beyond that we clearly believe there's an opportunity to expand our margins.","We've talked about at that point the revenue growth in the mid-single digits. And ultimately, we've been able to demonstrate over the years, we grow the top line X, we'll grow the bottom line more than X.","So from my perspective, once we get past the Lyrica LOE, clear opportunity to expand our margin performance in the P&L. Between now and then, clearly with the Lyrica LOE, we'll have to work our way through this. We'll give guidance for 2019 on our next call relative to the specifics by line item. But beyond the Lyrica LOE, clearly we're optimistic about our ability to expand margins.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Angela, please.","Angela Hwang - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks for the question, Chris. I'm going to talk a little bit just about our prospect in growth in terms of sterile injectables and then just talk a little bit about biosimilars as well.","We see the global sterile injectables market as being a very attractive market. It's large, it's growing, it has high barriers to entry due to the complexity of manufacturing. And for that reason, we are very focused on our remediation efforts as a critical success factor in this market.","We are confident about our remediation plans. We expect our supply to improve significantly towards the end of 2019, after which we see this business as being a significant growth contributor to Pfizer. So we remain committed to this business. And we see a tremendous amount of potential and growth prospect here.","Likewise, with biosimilars, we see tremendous growth potential. You've seen that over this quarter, we grew 40% with our biosimilars portfolio, growth in Europe as well as in the U.S.","Our U.S. growth currently has seen some great progress in closed systems, in regional plans, as well as in Medicare. However, in the commercial plans, that is where we continue to be challenged with growth due to J&J's exclusionary contracting. So we remain focused on working with our customers and payers to see the long-term savings benefits that can be derived from the use of biosimilars over short-term rebates.","However, our portfolio is changing in that we are now venturing from just Inflectra alone to entering the oncology biosimilar space, where we see very different dynamics here and are also excited about this growth. This is a market that has already seen the entrance of biosimilars in the form of filgrastim. And there has already been really good uptake of filgrastim in the U.S.","We see different dynamics in that the treatment \u2013 the duration of treatment is shorter, therefore you're going to get new patients cycling through faster. That is going to enable payers and customers to transition patients from the originator molecule to biosimilars much more quickly, thereby allowing them to benefit from the savings.","So we're excited about our entrance into oncology biosimilars and look forward to not just this launch, but to realizing the five next biosimilars that we have in our pipeline.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, I just want to say, Ian, it's been a real pleasure to work with you and learning from you over the years and in terms of all the value you've been able to unlock from the Wyeth acquisition and then some.","A question for you, Albert. The message today is that large-scale deals seem off the table. But with the biotech tape (40:48) coming under pressure, some of your key growth drivers looking like they're flattening out, and with your strong balance sheet and your higher P\/E multiple since early last summer, it would seem to me that you have a lot more options today than you did six months ago.","Can you define what those options look like in your mind? And if a large-scale deal is off the table \u2013 how do you define a large-scale deal? I mean, I would assume that back in 2009 when you bought Wyeth, a $60 billion or $66 billion deal, that was a large-scale deal. But today, you're a much bigger company. It's a completely different market. That may not be considered a large-scale deal. So if you could please define what you mean by that.","And then, secondly, if you could talk about what sort of options that you see for your Essentials (sic) [Essential] Health business. Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Hey, Jami, thank you much for those kind comments. I'll then pass it over to Albert to answer the meats of your question.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Jami. Look, a $64 billion acquisition, it is a large M&A for any standards. But you are right, but for us, we have the ability and the balance sheet to execute basically whatever we would like to execute, if we see the value to customers.","The way that we see right now large M&As is not based on our ability to execute or not. It is based on how destructive they could be by integrating them. And this is the main concern right now.","We are going to enter into a period of growth post 2020. And we need to make sure that we execute right now on our pipeline, we execute right now on our commercial launches and market preparations. And a large M&A typically comes with big integration plans, but distracts operations during this integration. And this is what we would like to avoid.","Obviously, there are opportunities over there with biotechs that are going down, although price are going down for a reason usually. But the truth is that as we are looking in our capital allocation, we are planning to scan the market for both opportunities that will not bring the destruction, operational destruction that a large M&A could bring, but could enhance our growth trajectory or our pipeline.","Now on the second question on the \u2013 basically you're asking on the optionality, obviously external separation in the form that we had contemplated in the past is off the table because as you said and as you know, we are going to operate from the beginning of this financial year with a new operational construct.","That being said, we constantly look our businesses and all parts of our businesses for fit internally and we will continue doing that.","As I said, let me tell you where we are right now. On the Innovative business, it is very clear that the focus is executing the pipeline and the new launches. In the Consumer Healthcare business, we already said that we are examining options to separate or not this business. And we will come to a decision by year-end.","In our newly-established Established Medicines business, the focus right now is to stand up this business. We need to make sure that we segregate it from Pfizer by providing them substantial autonomy. We need to make sure that we relocate the leadership to China where most of the growth is coming. And this is right now where we are.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and Albert, thanks for the great overview.","First question for Ian, just on pricing. I know you've indicated that you're going to obviously be pausing on taking any price increases through the end of this year. Just your thoughts on how you will attack pricing going into next year.","A question for Frank. What was the contribution of price and volume in the quarter?","And then on Xtandi, can you just give the split of sales that are in the metastatic versus nonmetastatic segment? And what is the risk that if a generic ZYTIGA launches at a significant discounts, if there's two approved but potentially 10 entrants and pricing possibly eroding there, what the impact might be on Xtandi going forward? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. John, thank you for that three-part question. I'm going to address the pricing, and then we'll have Frank do your price versus volume. And then John will answer your question on \u2013 the questions you raise about Xtandi.","Look, our pricing \u2013 I don't think our pricing situation has changed. We remain \u2013 our pricing philosophy is to price to the value of the product and price inside a competitive marketplace. I expect that like most industries, we will look at our pricing situation in January and take decisions based on what the competitive set is and what our value proposition is in the new marketplace. I have at this moment in time no different view about how we will take price our increases as we did last year.","So with that, Frank, do you want to talk about pricing volume right now?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. So, John, global basis price was minus 2%, volume was plus 4%, so operationally plus 2%. We were up $243 million operationally in revenue. FX was a minus 1%, $113 million. So net-net we reported plus 1%, $130 million in revenue.","And just a little color commentary on that minus 2% on price. If you look over the last 10 years, on average, that price number has been plus or minus low-single digits. So we're still in that range of plus or minus low-single digits.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, John. So we're still in the very early days following the nonmetastatic CRPC approval. And contributions from that indication were relatively modest in quarter three.","We expect the full impact of this opportunity will take a couple of years to realize, as much of the value from this indication is built through patient accumulation and the longer duration of therapy given its earlier stage of use.","We're continuing to leverage our relationships with urologists as we launch the indication. And we've seen a very encouraging uptick in our new-to-brand trends since the PROSPER approval. So we're very positive about the opportunity that this represents.","In relation to your question about generic ZYTIGA, we generally don't expect generic ZYTIGA to impact our business in a meaningful way. Market share erosion historically comes from the branded version of the same compound rather than a therapeutic substitution.","And Xtandi now has different indications than ZYTIGA for metastatic and nonmetastatic CRPC. We believe these agents are not likely to be viewed by physicians as interchangeable or substitutable. And ACP preference is not expected to be negatively impacted by the generic availability of a ZYTIGA.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a few. First, relative to pneumococcal vaccines, what was your conclusion from the recent ACIP meeting? And will you have data on the 20-valent vaccine by their next meeting in February? So that's the first question.","Second, can you quantify the non-cash gain for Cerevel and its creation that was in Q3 other income?","And then lastly, how does Pfizer foresee Bavencio's prospects in first line renal cell carcinoma given the recent news from competitors? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you. We'll ask John to take two of the three questions, and then Frank will take the noncash question. John?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","All right. So thanks for the question, Steve. So the ACIP obviously met last week. And their \u2013 purpose of their review was looking at the adult recommendation for adults 65 and over in the U.S.","It's important to state that this is relatively early in their process. The next stage for ACIP is to grade the data and then vote on the continuation of the 65-plus healthy age recommendation, which according to the CDC is likely to happen sometime in 2019.","Our belief is that given the effectiveness shown by Prevnar 13 in preventing vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia in adults 65 and over, we continue to support a broad recommendation of 65-plus. And that direct vaccination remains the only sure form of protection against persistent vaccine type IPD and pneumonia. We will obviously continue to work with the CDC to generate data and communicate the burden of impact of pneumococcal disease.","And in relation to your question about Prevnar 20, obviously as you know, we've sort of indicated that we have received a positive breakthrough designation from the FDA. And we expect to start Phase 3 studies within the next few months. But we don't anticipate that we'll be submitting data on Prevnar 20, PCV20, to the ACIP for their forthcoming meeting.","In relation to your question about the prospects that we see in the immuno-therapy space, we are really very encouraged. We've always said that we believe that the true value of I-O is to be expected in effective combinations. And the results of our first Phase 3 I-O combination study support that view.","So the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial that you're referring to, that combined Bavencio with Inlyta in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma, demonstrated that the combination provided superior progression-free survival compared with Sutent.","The Bavencio and Inlyta combination demonstrated positive results across a broad RCC patient population in the first line setting, regardless of the prognostic risk group or PDL expression. And I think I would just add that obviously we noted the positive Inlyta and Keytruda results in RCC. And we think that that emphasizes the growing importance of Inlyta as a gold standard TKI inhibitor in the management of RCC.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","And then, Steve, on your question on the non-cash gain. The gain was $343 million and it was in GAAP results only. It was not included in adjusted results.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess, Ian, Albert, for both of you, so when the price increases were rolled back earlier this summer, there's an expectation that price increases could be instituted again in January, if no concrete steps are taken on rebate.","So I guess my question is, are you planning on putting them back on in January, your price increases? And has there been any dialogue or are you expecting any pushback from the administration when that happens? So that's first.","And then on tafamidis, my question really is, so you've mentioned 1% diagnosis. You've also mentioned it's a blockbuster opportunity. My question really is, do you see this as a $1 billion opportunity or as a $5 billion opportunity? Just trying to put book ends around how big this could be from your perspective, given all the investor debate around that.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Umer. Well, on pricing, what I'm trying to indicate is that we did voluntarily agree to defer price increases until the blueprint was implemented over the end of this year. We've been working with the President on parts of the blueprint. And I expect our approach by the end of year will be, what I would characterize as business as normal.","We price to the marketplace. We price competitively, and we will make those decisions towards the end of the year and early in January.","So thanks for your question on that. And then we'll turn to the scope of standards.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","So thanks for the question, Umer. Obviously as you know, we don't give forecasts for inducing \u2013 or individual products.","Let me just sort of underscore what I mentioned already, that we're incredibly excited about the opportunity. Any time you have positive clinical data that demonstrates significant reduction in mortality and hospitalization in a patient population that doesn't have access to any alternative treatments, that has to be a significant opportunity.","Clearly as we said, highly underdiagnosed at the moment. Our focus is going to be sort of really making sure that we can accelerate the knowledge around how to diagnose appropriately and sharing our clinical data with physicians. So we're very excited about the opportunity that presents.","Certainly, it's premature for us to begin to frame the size of our revenue opportunity particularly. But we'll make sure that our expectations are obviously going to be part of our 2019 guidance when we give that in the first quarter next year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on the pipeline. So first question here is on tanezumab. Would you expect to see a potential imbalance in RPOA in the chronic low back pain indication? And why or why not?","And then secondly for the ATTR-CM indication, how big do you think that population actually is, now that there is better diagnosis?","And the last question I had was on your DMD gene therapy program. What kind of data are you going to report next year? And what do you think the competitive advantages of your product are as it relates to promoter vector in gene and how do you think about this opportunity versus looking at CRISPR for DMD? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, I think we'll ask Mikael to answer your first and last question. The one in the middle, we'll refer back to what has been substantially answered already by John. And I believe we will give our indications of the \u2013 in our guidance in the first quarter about what we expect from tafamidis. Clearly, it's a substantial opportunity, but one that we're not ready yet to talk about until we give our guidance next year.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for your interest in tanezumab. And let me just punctuate that we were really excited about the data from our first study that showed that more than 50% of the patients got a 50% or greater reduction in OA pain and about 35% reported a 70% or greater improvement in pain. So these are real great benefits for patients.","Now concerning chronic lower back pain, those patients are generally younger. Most of them do not as advanced OA as a typical OA pain population. And we, in general, have excluded patients that have severe OA in the chronic low back pain, because we're using a higher dose for that study.","And we do not anticipate that there would be a major impact of rapidly progressing OA in that patient population.","Concerning DMD, we have a very, I think, strong DMD gene test set that we're using with a unique gene expression capsid and also our capsid has certain unique features that we think will optimize its delivery to mass zones.","And we have started treating patients and a part of a dose escalation, but thus far we are pleased to see the tolerability of the gene therapy product. And initial oxidations are encouraging. And we look forward to continuing this study.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. And, Ian, let me add my congratulations and best wishes to you after a very successful career and value creation at Pfizer.","My two questions are, could you please discuss your discussions with commercial payers to evolve rebate contracts in the commercial sector?","And then, second, going back to the high level, Albert, I'm hoping that you could rearticulate the purpose of the new operational construct and the incremental value that you expect to drive potentially, including additional strategic action. You had referenced the separation decision, and I just wanted to get a little bit clearer picture on the opportunity you see for additional value creation. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, thank you for your comment, David. I appreciate them. On the discussions with payers, I would say there has been, outside of our walls, limited discussion with payers. Obviously, there are different positions between the PBMs and insurers and ourselves as through \u2013 regarding the effectiveness of the passing on of rebates to the point-of-sale or to the patient.","We've done a lot of internal work looking at it and understanding how we'd operationalize it. But really, there's not a lot of discussions we can have outside of our four walls until we see what the rule looks like when it's published.","That being said, I continue to think it's a very effective way of taking pricing pressures away from the patient, especially not exposing to list price. I'll pass it over to Albert for his further comments.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","David, the reason why we organized this Pfizer into all these businesses is because we believe that they have different growth drivers. And we believe that the main value contributor for a corporation like Pfizer, it is topline growth.","So with this reorganization, we tried to maximize the opportunities and upgrade the talent that each one of them has, for example, by focusing our efforts on innovative business in this pipeline, focusing our efforts on innovative business into creating new markets, because a lot of our products and future portfolio are coming to new market, because they are addressing unmet medical needs. This is crucial.","When it comes to the Established Medicines, the way that we describe this business, it is off-patent iconic brands like the Lipitors, like the Viagras, like the Celebrex of the world. So we are not transferring over there everything that it is off patent.","But those brands that they have significant growth potential, presence and potential in particularly parts of the world. These are not brands that we expect to grow in developed Europe or the U.S. But these are brands that we are growing, And we are expected to continue growing in China.","In fact, to be able to enhance this opportunity, we are relocating a senior management team in China to be able to manage this opportunity, including a new member of the executive team. So this is the growth strategy over there, plan to explore China as a whole in terms of the contribution to pharmaceutical innovation.","And in terms of our Consumer business was always operating as an autonomous business. We are enhancing its autonomy, particularly around manufacturing issues this year. And we continue examining options.","My reference to Jami's question before around, we never \u2013 we always examine options for our business, and particularly your interest on the established business. As I said, right now, the important thing it is to stand up this business. It is \u2013 before examining options for a business, you need to make sure that operationally is \u2013 it's doing very well. And this is the focus.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Albert, you mentioned simplifying the organizational structure and not having an appetite for bigger deals. But \u2013 and I know you still have to finalize the strategy. But are you comfortable with the number of therapeutic areas in Innovative? Is the creation of Cerevel a strategy that you think could be a blueprint for other categories that are less of a priority?","And the second question, just on the recent drug pricing proposal. And I recognize that most of the drivers for Pfizer today are more Part D than B. I know you don't want to give specifics, but how do you guys view the delta between the U.S. and O-U.S. net pricing? Are there methodologies that you think make more sense to make comparisons easier? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, Geoff, I'll answer the pricing one. I don't think it makes sense to make the comparison to start with, because what you're doing is you're importing one country's industrial policy in pre-writing into a country that's based on innovation.","So number one, I don't think \u2013 but to regards how the government may or may not create baskets and reference pricing, however it starts out, it always continues to get worse as the only intention of that type of reference pricing is to drive down the cost to the government. And it's not interested in ensuring the best treatments get to patients. So overall, I think we \u2013 hopefully the rule will be revised and reconsidered. With that, pass it over to Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian, and thank you for your question. I mean it's a very, very good question, like all the questions that have been asked today.","I think the fact that we narrow our area of focus is a very big part of our efforts last year and contributor to the higher R&D productivity. It is not only relevant to us in general. It is just that this consumer industry, companies that they are focusing on smaller number of therapeutic areas. They have in general much higher returns to shareholders.","As we said, obviously Pfizer is a very big name and can apply with one machine from one end, it meets multiple. So and this is the question, what is the right balance?","I think right now we do have the right balance. We are focusing on six therapeutic areas that they are enough to pump our growth in the years to come. And also they are a small number relatively so that we can build something with expertise in each one of them.","To your question, if we will employ this new, innovative type of partnerships, the answer is yes. And actually, the difference in the last two exits from, if I can call it like that, from us, it was related with (1:05:27) and neuroscience was different than the way that we did it in the past by just exiting or selling the asset. We do participate in the space, but we do participate in partnership with people that they have the focus and the expertise to drive much higher results there. And we will continue doing so if we have this opportunity.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. On Ibrance, PALOMA-3 was published. It did not show an overall survival benefit. And I'm wondering if you think that potentially creates any hurdles, reimbursement or access, in ex-U.S. markets specifically?","And related to that, I wonder if that raises a question about the two adjuvant trials that are running. I know it's a different but related endpoint of DFS, so I'm curious to get your thoughts. Wondering if that could show, for example, a nonstatistically significant trend only.","And then a second question is on biosimilars. And really looking for any guidance you can give on operating margins. So directionally, if you look out at your long-term forecast, what are you expecting versus today? As volumes grow, you would get a scale benefit, and that should help. But an offset on the negative side could be more price erosion over time as there are more entrants per molecule. So how do those future margins in your forecast compare to today's margins? And how can you describe today's margins relative to, let's say, the branded business or the rest of the Pfizer business? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Tim, on the biosimilars, we still continue to model that along the lines of a sterile injectable market, high barriers to entry, high cost to produce a biosimilar. I think we've seen some players repricing (1:07:37) and the European prices have been much as we see the sterile injectables in Europe, that have a lower price there. Initially, I think that regulatory body isn't as focused on the need for quality or focused on ensuring there is money to produce the next wave of innovative biosimilars.","I think the U.S. market will continue to be similar to sterile injectables. And if society wants a vibrant biosimilar market going forward, given the upfront cost to produce biosimilars, I do think the market has to react very similar to sterile injectable margins and the stickiness of hard-to-make products in that marketplace.","With that, I'll pass it over to John to answer the Ibrance question.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question, Tim. So let me just say in relation to the PALOMA overall survival data that we presented recently, although the difference didn't reach prespecified threshold for a statistical significance, there was a highly clinically relevant numerical improvement in overall survival of nearly seven months with Ibrance plus fulvestrant compared to placebo plus fulvestrant. So overall survival was 34.9 months, compared to 28 months.","I think we were actually very encouraged that that analysis was very consistent with the improvement previously demonstrated in the primary endpoint for DFS in PALOMA-3. And we will obviously be engaging with payers across Europe and elsewhere in relation to sharing these data. But we remain very confident in the clinical profile and the effectiveness of Ibrance for patients who we've now demonstrated in a variety of settings for metastatic breast cancer.","In terms of your question about whether we see risk in our early breast cancer trials, we really don't see any read-across from these data, other than the fact that we obviously have seen very positive response clinically in patients with metastatic breast cancer. And we see no reason to change our perspective that this is not only a very significant and important opportunity for patients and for Pfizer, but actually about the potential profile for Ibrance in that indication.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Three, please. In reference to Xtandi, is there an argument to be made for launching an authorized generic for government plans in order to increase patient affordability, particularly for the nonlist patients? Number one.","Number two, just focusing on the anticipated move to net pricing for Medicare, I'd be very interested in Albert and Ian's view how long they think the commercial book of business will cling to rebates given economic incentives before migrating to net pricing, if indeed that does take place in government plans.","And then finally, for Angela, just given the pivot towards China on the Established Medicines business, could you give us some granularity about what is driving the growth in China over the last nine months? Many thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Andrew, on your innovative idea of launching an authorized generic, it's an unusual suggestion given that we have a product with an extended patent period and we're dealing with the access challenges through mechanisms such as contributing to foundations that allow patients who cannot afford the medicine to access it. And we also have our own not-paid-for prescription program as well. So I think the complexities of running an authorized generic alongside a branded when both are patent protected are too substantial.","And then on a net pricing, if we get to net pricing, which \u2013 or the removal of rebates or rebates going to the patient, I would expect that the commercial book of business would move reasonably quickly to the same system. I can't see us maintaining a dual system there.","And then I'll pass it to Angela for the \u2013 on why is China doing so well within your leadership?","Angela Hwang - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Thank you, Ian. So we have had tremendous success in China this year. And I would narrow that down to two portfolios. First, our cardiovascular portfolio and second, our anti-infective portfolio. I think in both of those what we're seeing are some favorable, I think, epidemiology that stems from low diagnosis, low treatment, and the ability for our products to have a prominent market share in the treatment of those diseases.","So if I think about Lipitor, and Norvasc, sulperazone (1:12:46) as three of those key products, each one of those have grown tremendously through this year through expansion.","And not only is this expansion I think from a sort of getting more patients treated, but we also have had a very focused effort on geographical expansion. So moving beyond the large cities into smaller cities, into county hospitals. So I think it's a combination of the continued high patient demand, coupled with our geographical expansion that is leading us to continued success and rapid growth that we're seeing in our portfolio.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And just to punctuate that, I think that the untapped volume in China, given its size and given the narrow segment of society we sell to, is colossal and a good hedge against any pricing pressures. I would expect to see a robust volume response to any ongoing pricing pressures.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And, operator, can we take our final question, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple on tanezumab. So just kind of curious as we think about these upcoming Phase 3 readouts next year, just your thoughts on the importance of providing doctors with a roadmap to monitor and prevent these bone disorders from leading to joint replacement. And so my first part of that question is on the recent Phase 3 data, are you confident that if physicians diagnose type 1 RPOA, they could diagnose, stop treatment, and potentially stop symptom progression there?","And then my second part of that question is just that, there were no cases of osteonecrosis. I know that going back to 2010, 2012, during the period of the clinical hold, you guys and FDA had a little bit of a difference regarding diagnosis of osteonecrosis versus RPOA. So just wondering if you're confident you're on the same page with the FDA there. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael, could you answer that?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, we're excited about tanezumab. And we obviously look forward to the significant study readout we have coming next year.","I think we've got a good first feel for again confirming the encouraged efficacy that we're seeing in this first study in a patient group that was in urgent need of new medication and had failed to get the benefit or were intolerable to current available medication.","When it comes to management of rapidly progressing OA, I wanted just to say that we had 1.3% of that, the majority of it was actually of Type 1, which is more of a mild change in the joint space narrowing. And we had a smaller fraction that was of Type 2 with that much more deterioration of the joint.","I think, yeah, these are structural changes that occur also in the natural scope of osteoarthritis with a growing aging patient population and can be easily managed by physicians according to medical practice. And we look upon the overall benefit risk as very encouraging for these new treatment options that opportunities in a difficult situation where opioids have caused an unfortunate situation for many patient groups.","Of course, as we get the entire readout of the tanezumab OA and CBT, we will work with reviewing data, dialogues with regulators, and assuming that the drug will continue to show this promising benefit, we will obviously as always when Pfizer provide new medicines, have proper educational and implementation programs to make sure physicians and patients can use the drug in the most effective way.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Before we close, I'd just like to say to the analyst community, I expect this to be my last call for Pfizer on the analysts call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2013 performance. I\u2019m joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer Business; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.","The slide that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Third Quarter 2013 located in the Investor Presentations section at the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today, October 29, 2013.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chuck. I\u2019ll begin with some comments on the quarter. Overall, we delivered good operational performance, generated solid financial results and continued to see steady progress with many of our in-line products and pipeline assets. Operationally, revenues for the Oncology business grew 26% due to the continued strong performance of new products, primarily Inlyta and Xalkori. We also had another strong quarter operationally from Lyrica, which grew 11%; and from Celebrex, which grew 13%. Despite macroeconomic and other factors, the emerging markets business grew 5% operationally, primarily due to volume growth for key products in the Primary Care area such as Lipitor, Norvasc, Lyrica and Celebrex, especially in China. We still anticipate achieving mid single-digit growth in emerging markets for the year.","Turning to an update on our recently launched and approved products and pipeline assets. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval of Duavee, our novel combination therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and we anticipate launching this product in the U.S. during the first quarter of next year. We and our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb continue to focus on improving the performance and physician uptake for Eliquis.","In the U.S., we have seen positive momentum in the week-over-week growth in total prescriptions, and in late September, we launched our direct-to-consumer television advertising campaign. Eliquis also has been launched for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and several additional markets including Australia, Spain, and Canada where reimbursement has been established. We also see potential expansion opportunities for Eliquis with additional indications. With Bristol-Myers, we\u2019ve submitted an sNDA in the U.S. for VTE prevention in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.","Turning to Xeljanz. We are pleased with the progress of the launch in the U.S. and various other markets, which continues to be in line with our expectations, particularly in the context of being part of a large, but slow growth segment within the anti-TNF market. We are seeing a steady increase in prescriptions. Comparing the third quarter with the second quarter this year, we saw a 53% sequential growth in total prescription volume in the U.S.","Overall, the physician\u2019s feedback on Xeljanz has been very positive. Satisfaction amongst users is high. In fact, nearly 3,000 healthcare providers have prescribed Xeljanz and over 75% have been repeat prescribers. We know that before prescribing, rheumatologists want to have a deep knowledge and confidence in Xeljanz\u2019s safety profile and clinical experience, particularly given it is a first-in-class product. To-date, the vast majority of physicians have reacted favorably to Xeljanz\u2019s clinical profile and we are focusing our efforts on continuing to educate physicians on Xeljanz\u2019s clinical data.","We also have several Phase 3 programs underway for Xeljanz. The Phase 3 program in psoriasis is progressing and is one of the largest global clinical trial programs in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to-date. There are five studies in the program. Earlier this month, we announced the top line results from the first two studies, which provided information consistent with our expectations based on the Phase 2 data for psoriasis. The other three studies in the Phase 3 psoriasis program include two pivotal studies and a long-term extension study.","We anticipate top line results for the pivotal trials in the second quarter of 2014 and will issue a top line data release after we\u2019ve received and reviewed the results. We have initiated a Phase 3 program to evaluate Xeljanz for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis, which includes two pivotal trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of Xeljanz and one long-term extension study. The first data from these trials is anticipated in 2015, and we continue to study Xeljanz for other important inflammatory diseases with several Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs ongoing.","This includes a Phase 3 program in ulcerative colitis and a Phase 2 program in Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and a topical formulation for psoriasis. We are also moving forward with once-a-day modified release program for Xeljanz in RA. The FDA recently agreed that a Phase 3 study is not necessary for the once-a-day dose and we plan to file a new drug application with the FDA in 2015.","Beyond the Xeljanz and Eliquis Phase 3 programs, we have or will be initiating several Phase 3 studies and will be reporting on clinical trial data results from our primary care, vaccines, and oncology portfolios. I continue to be pleased with the steps we have taken and the progress we are making towards improving our R&D performance.","Looking at the primary care pipeline, there are several promising candidates. This month, we\u2019re initiating a Phase 3 program for bococizumab, the proposed generic name for RN316, our PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower LDL cholesterol. This is a global program that includes multiple lipid-lowering studies as well as two cardiovascular outcome studies in more than 22,000 patients.","Compared to the PCSK9 inhibitor Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials being conducted by our competitors, only our bococizumab Phase 3 program includes a dedicated cardiovascular outcome study in patients who cannot achieve LDL levels lower than 100 mg per dL despite the use of statins. This is a very high risk patient population with significant unmet need who represents a tremendous cost to our healthcare system.","Our second Phase 3 outcomes trial will address whether driving LDL cholesterols to levels well below current guideline recommended targets will lead to a further reduction in cardiovascular events. Importantly, compared to other programs, our Phase 3 program includes the broadest range of risk \u2013 of high-risk patients and need of improved cholesterol management. We are currently completing the final analysis of the datasets of our completed Phase 2b study and plan to submit the results of presentation at the American College of Cardiology Meeting in March 2014.","We are planning to continue development of tanezumab for the treatment of osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, and cancer pain. We have just entered into a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly & Company to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab, which provides that in addition to certain potential milestone payments to Pfizer. Pfizer and Lilly will equally share product development expenses and potential revenues and certain product-related costs. The tanezumab program is currently subject to a partial clinical hold by the FDA pending submission of non-clinical data to the FDA, which we anticipate submitting in the first half of 2014. In addition, we are initiating a Phase 3 program with our partner Merck for ertugliflozin, our SGL2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","Turning to vaccines, we expect to have data read-outs in three disease areas; pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, meningitis B, and Staph aureus. For pneumococcal pneumonia, the case accrual in the CAPiTA trial involving Prevenar 13 adult has been completed. The processing of the cases will take several months to complete and we have not yet seen the data. We expect the read-out of the top line results early in 2014.","For meningitis B, we anticipate sharing results of the Phase 2 study data in adolescents and young adults who are the major carriers of this disease at a key Medical Congress in the first half of 2014. Of note, our vaccine contains two protein components, which elicit a broad immune response against the majority of meningitis B vaccine strains in these immunized individuals.","We are encouraged by the efficacy and tolerability data we have seen to-date and have already initiated a pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program that includes Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials that will include more than 20,000 participants. If trial, enrollment, and recruiting goes as planned, data from this program are expected in the next several years. For Staph aureus, we recently concluded a Phase 2a study, which showed encouraging signals that our vaccine elicits positive immune response. The next step is to move into a Phase 2b study in surgical patients. We anticipate sharing results from the Phase 2a study in the first half of 2014 at a key medical congress.","In oncology, we also anticipate several readouts in 2014. In breast cancer, we expect the final efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 palbociclib study to readout in early 2014 to be presented at ASCO in June 2014 or at another congress next year. We have initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib. One study mimics the trial design of the Phase 2 study in patients with postmenopausal ER-positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer, which has a planned enrollment of 450 patients. The other study is in patients with hormone receptor positives, HR-positive and HER2 negative advanced recurrent breast cancer. It compares fulvestrant plus palbociclib to fulvestrant plus placebo. In addition, we expect to start a Phase 3 study for palbociclib in the next few months in early breast cancer for high risk patients with neo-adjuvant treatment.","For non-small cell lung cancer, we are expecting top line results from two Phase 3 studies of dacomitinib in the early part of next year. We have five programs in various stages to develop biosimilars to innovate \u2013 of innovative products. Our development program includes biosimilars for Herceptin, which is scheduled to start Phase 3 within the next few months. In addition, we have a biosimilar development program for Rituxan and Remicade and Humira that are scheduled for Phase 3 to start next year, and our biosimilar for Avastin will begin Phase 1 next year.","The ongoing R&D investment level to support our late stage pipeline opportunities is warranted by the significant revenue potential associated with these programs and we expect that as these programs further progress, some incremental R&D investment will be necessary. That said, we will balance this need with overall shareholder return and we will continue to be opportunistic regarding additional internal and externally sourced compounds that can further enhance our research pipeline.","I will close with a few words about new commercial structure we\u2019ve announced last quarter. We have been aligning talent, asset and individual reporting system to support our new operating structure. We remain on track for commencing operations in the new structure at the start of 2014 and for providing a 2014 baseline management view of profit and loss for each business starting with our financial results for the first quarter of 2014.","In summary, I believe we are making steady progress across the business by enhancing the quality of the pipeline, demonstrating fiscal discipline on how we deploy our capital and executing on our business plans in order to drive greater value for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details of the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. I want to remind everybody that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24 of this year, the financial results of the Animal Health business are reported as a discontinued operation in condensed consolidated statements of income for year-to-date 2013 and third quarter and year-to-date 2012. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Third quarter 2013 reported revenues of approximately $12.6 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues decreased operationally by $38 million or less than 1% primarily due to the negative impact of the continued erosion of branded Lipitor in the U.S., developed Europe and certain other markets. the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, a decrease in government purchases of Prevnar and Enbrel in certain emerging markets and the loss of exclusivity of certain other products, including Lyrica in Canada, February, 2013, and Viagra in most major markets in Europe in June of 2013. These were partially offset by the growth of certain in-line products, including Lyrica, Enbrel, Inlyta and Xalkori globally and Celebrex and Xeljanz in the U.S.","I want to point out that reported revenues also included $67 million from transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis, which are expected to continue for approximately two years. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.58 increased 16%, primarily due to the aggregate decrease and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $341 million or 5%, due to the benefit of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, the non-recurrence of the $250 million payment in the year-ago quarter for the acquisition of the exclusive over-the-counter rights to Nexium, which was included in R&D expenses, as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange on these items of $166 million or 2%.","These were partially offset by higher SI&A spending to support new product launches. In addition, there were fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program and the first full quarter impact of the Zoetis exchange offer, which also favorably impacted adjusted diluted EPS.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.39 versus $0.43 in the year-ago quarter and favorably impacted primarily by lower legal charges, lower acquisition related and other cost and fewer shares outstanding, which were more than offset by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, lower income from discontinued operations and the higher effective tax rate.","During the third quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets increased 2% operationally, driven primarily by strong volume growth in China, especially for Lipitor. In these BRIC-MT markets, volume growth of 3% was partially offset by price reductions of 1%.","Revenue from all emerging markets increased 5% operationally in the third quarter. If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with Hisun in the third quarter, we would have had operational revenue growth compared to the third quarter of 2012 of 6% in our emerging markets business, 4% in the BRIC-MT markets and 16% in China.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted revenues by 2% or $271 million, and had a positive impact of 2% or $166 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to year-ago quarter.","Now moving onto our 2013 financial guidance, based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges for certain components of our full-year 2013 financial guidance. We are narrowing the reported revenue range to $50.8 billion to $51.8 billion from $50.8 billion to $52.8 billion.","I want to remind everyone that beginning on November 1, 2013, we enter into the 36-month sunset period and the collaboration agreement with Amgen for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada. During this period, we expected our share of the Enbrel collaboration, which is high margin, because there is no associated cost of good sold will decline significantly. In addition, going forward, the recognition of profits from the Enbrel collaboration will shift from alliance revenue to other income as we move to a royalty structure. Furthermore, these royalty payments will be much less than our current level of Enbrel profits. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, however, our exclusive rights of Enbrel will continue in perpetuity.","I also want to point out that our Spiriva collaboration, which is also recorded in Alliance revenue will continue to wind down during the fourth quarter 2013 and 2014, most notably to the U.S. and Canada. Currently, the majority of Alliance revenue is composed of Enbrel in the U.S and Canada, as well as Spiriva.","Moving onto adjusted cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues, we are narrowing this range to 18% to 18.5%. We are narrowing our adjusted SI&A expense range to $14.2 billion to $14.7 billion while continuing to absorb launch cost and support of new products. We are narrowing our R&D guidance range from $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion, which will support our high potential late-stage pipeline opportunities. We now expect other deductions to be approximately $400 million and continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 28%. We are narrowing and lowering the reported diluted EPS range to $3.05 to $3.15 and we are narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.15 to $2.20 from $2.10 to $2.20.","Now moving onto key takeaways, third quarter results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products in various geographies as well as the ongoing volatility in emerging markets. We continue to expect full-year operational revenue growth in our emerging markets business to be in the mid single-digit percentage range.","In addition we continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share repurchases. We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our adjusted financial guidance. Our recently launched products are progressing at a measured and steady pace. We are advancing initiatives internally so that we will implement our new commercial structure at the start of 2014. We remain excited about our high potential late-stage pipeline assets and expect to allocate R&D investments to support their advancement beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 or early 2014.","Finally, we continue to create shareholder value through the prudent allocation of our capital. To-date in 2013, we have repurchased approximately $13.1 billion or approximately 462.1 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase in the mid-teens of billions of dollars of our common stock this year. As a result, we expect to return more than $20 billion to our shareholders this year between buybacks and dividends. In addition, we expect the first quarter 2014 dividend level to be set by our Board of Directors during our December Board Meeting, and finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano","Thank you, Frank. And operator, please if we could now poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot. To the extent that there are a couple of other PCSK9s out there, can you talk about what you needed to see in Phase 2 to make this large investment and potentially how your product is differentiated beyond the clinical trial differences you highlighted? And secondly, Ian, curious how you think the collaboration in Japan is going with Mylan and whether you think that could be a good model in other places or more broadly? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Gregg. Well, clearly, we\u2019ve seen in the Phase 2 data, sufficient quality of data to encourage us to enter into Phase 3 and believe we have a highly competitive product. So I\u2019d ask John Young to give more details on that and also discuss the Mylan collaboration.","John Young","Okay. Thanks, Gregg. So let me take PCSK9 or bococizumab. First of all, we think we actually have a great antibody, which came out of our Rinat Labs in San Francisco. And I think in addition to having excellent substrate to take into clinical development, we also believe that we\u2019ve been able to put together a differentiator or potentially differentiated clinical program. So our program will be the only program investigating both high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations. And when we begin to look at the program in more detail, it includes a dedicated CV outcome study in patients who can\u2019t achieve LDL levels lower than 100 milligrams per deciliter despite the use of statins. It\u2019s a very high-risk patient population with a lot of unmet clinical need. And those patients, as you heard from Ian, really do represent tremendous cost to the healthcare system, so a positive outcome in that population we believe will be very significant, and we also combined in our program a second Phase 3 outcomes trial that will address whether driving LDL levels to well below current guideline recommended targets will lead to further reduction in cardiovascular events.","And I think lastly, the point to make is that importantly compared to other programs, our Phase 3 program includes the broadest range of high-risk patients in need of improved cholesterol management. And as I said, uniquely it includes both high-risk primary and secondary prevention patients.","So overall, we believe that the combination of good basic substrate and the antibody combined with a clinical program that we believe has the potential to demonstrate real differentiation across patient populations with significant unmet need that will enable us to bring a very competitive profile into what is clearly potentially a very attractive and promising marketplace.","In terms of Mylan, we continue to make positive progress with Mylan in Japan. the collaboration is on track. currently, we are selling around about 250 products from the combined company\u2019s generic portfolios. The transition integration of all 200 Mylan succondees to the Pfizer organization has been completed, and we\u2019ve completed the launch of the collaboration\u2019s first generic pipeline products in June based on initial performance, all nine products are forecasted to meet or exceed our full-year plans. So I think let me just finish on Mylan and say that we\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019re going to look to maintain that momentum into 2014.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, John. I\u2019d add that we\u2019re also very comfortable and pleased with the quality of partnership with Mylan, so\u2026","Charles E. Triano","Okay, thank you. next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. This is either for Ian or John. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about how you plan to monetize the value business, just how do you see this business growing, what are the opportunities on the table that will help to unlock value? And are one of those opportunities to sell the business, and if so, is there a time limit? Do you have to wait a certain amount of time, I know that you\u2019ve talked about the other businesses if you were to spin them out, you have to wait three years, but is there is a similar limit if you were going to sell this business, would you sell part of it? And also, if you were to sell it, would you be willing to accept someone else\u2019s stock in exchange for it? And then just a follow-up question on PCSK9, your competitors are not planning on getting \u2013 I don\u2019t believe they need outcomes trials to gain FDA approval, do you feel that you need these outcomes trials for approval or is this just to broaden your label and for further differentiation? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","Well, Jami. Thank you for those questions. On PCSK9, I\u2019ll ask John to comment on that first, but I think the issue is in this marketplace, we \u2013 our trials are constructed so as to be able to demonstrate value to society and payors. John, do you want to add anything more to that?","John Young","Yes. I think in terms of the program, as I\u2019ve already said, we believe we\u2019ve put together a really robust and potentially differentiated program. Clearly, we know that LDL-C is a very well established surrogate for cardiovascular risk, but certainly, we knew from dialogue and discussion we\u2019ve had with the FDA that it\u2019s conceivable that regulators may require demonstration of a beneficial effect on CV events before approving a new class of agents such as PCSK9 inhibitors.","At a minimum robust LDL-C lowering along with a comprehensive long-term safety database will likely be required for initial approval of bococizumab and potentially with our medicines in the class as well. And the bococizumab Phase 3 program is designed to address the potential for regulatory authorities to require in addition to LDL-C lowering, a robust long-term clinical safety database and cardiovascular outcomes data for approval.","Ian C. Read","Mikael, if you want to add anything, vis-\u00e0-vis the development of PCSK9 from the technical point of view?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. we have put in a lot of technical capabilities how to develop antibodies with the most potent and biopharmaceutically appropriate characteristics, and when you look at the class, I think you can see emerging data suggesting some of the antibodies being very potent and some being intermediate. And as Ian alluded to, we were very encouraged by the potent effect of our antibody in Phase 2 and its really robust LDL lowering tolerability and low frequency of anti-drug antibody?","Ian C. Read","Thank you. And Jami, on your questions on the value where we call it established products business unit, right now, we are focused on setting up the new organization model where we have two innovative businesses and one established business. You know we\u2019re doing that because we firmly believe those businesses have different characteristics and we want management uniquely focused on maximizing the growth opportunities of those businesses.","So, John, who is running that part of the business will clearly be looking at how to maximize the growth in the emerging markets, how to maximize our supply chain advantages in the developed markets, what growth opportunities there are in sterile injectables, either organically or inorganically, are there other BD activities that could be undertaken in that business such as 505(b) filings. And frankly it\u2019s simply too early to speculate on the future developments of those business. Right now as an organization, we are focused on getting them up and running, the management up in running in place looking at all of the different growth opportunities I just discussed looking at supply chain there are, and once those businesses are up and running and once there is transparency, then we\u2019ll see how the market evaluates some of the parts of those businesses.","Charles E. Triano","Great, thank you, Ian. Operator, please next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris T. Schott \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great thanks very much, just following up on that, Ian how long do you think are you going to want to see these three business units running separately before you will be comfortable and in a position to evaluate and make that decision on the next steps for Pfizer with regards to the strategic alternatives for your portfolio of businesses? Is that something that\u2019s going to take a year or is that something longer? I guess I am kind of thinking that as we -- next year is about setting them up. As you go out into 2015, is that a timeframe where it\u2019s reasonable to think about decision on some of these? The second question I had, similarly a follow-up on Jami\u2019s question, if you were to decide that the value core was something that made sense to separate from Pfizer, are there structures so it will allow you to do that prior to 2017 if that\u2019s the right decision or is that something that\u2019s unreasonable to think about from a timing perspective. Just trying to get some clarity on the timing if in fact you went that direction with the business? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chris. I don\u2019t have a fixed timeline in my mind. Right now, we are really focused on the operational aspect and let\u2019s see the value these businesses will come from their exclusive execution and management making them valuable by focusing on growth. And as that occurs, we\u2019ll evaluate our options in a timely manner. And I will ask Frank to comment on actual mechanics and -- of any type of transaction with\u2026","Frank A. D\u2019Amelio","Sure. So Chris, the way to think about this is I\u2019ll call it public transactions versus private transactions. In a public transaction, three years of audited financials are required. So think about three years for perspective, we have audited financials. In a private transaction, sale of a partial business of an entire business or some sort of a joint venture and anything like that it depends on a significance test. And there is three elements to the significance test, there is an asset test, an income test, and an investment test. And what really drives the requirement there for audited financials is based on the size of the acquirer, and then the income, the assets and the investment of what\u2019s being acquired compared to the acquirer\u2019s income investments and assets. And that can range anywhere from zero in terms of audited financials up to three years. So that's really what will drive the audited financial requirements, but once again to punctuate what Ian said, what we are all about doing is getting these businesses to operationally hum and execute with excellence.","Chris Schott \u2013 JP Morgan","Alright. Thank you Frank.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Frank, our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford C. Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Two questions please if I could just go back to the split up. Can you better characterize the possibility that Pfizer does not split itself up in the complete sense of a word you previously alluded to the idea that if a market appropriately revalues Pfizer once they better appreciate the financials for those different divisions that perhaps at full split up would not be necessary. So my question is, is it reasonably possible that you don\u2019t fully split up. And then on palbociclib when might we start to see data in non-breast cancers, it seems like you should either have data in hand already or you should very closely have it in hand on tumor types in the blood cancer area, in colorectal and then lung. And can you say so far that you haven\u2019t had any failures in any of these other tumor types.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Tim. Well this issue of split is totally dictated by what our view will be on how to maximize shareholder value at the appropriate time. So when these businesses are operating, when there is transparency for analysts, when they have had time to establish track record then we will look at that and we will make decisions based on how best to maximize the value to shareholders irrespective of size or composition or structure of residual companies, because this management team is focused on producing shareholder value and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll take the decision and I don\u2019t really think I can add anything more than that of than to say that our guiding star is how to create shareholder value. Geno, would you like to talk about palbo?","Geno Germano","Sure. So Tim let me just comment that our highest priority is to efficiently advance our breast cancer program right now at palbociclib as Ian mentioned we've initiated two of the Phase 3 trials, we\u2019ll initiate another Phase 3 trial in breast cancer this year. And frankly we are looking at other breast cancer populations to explore further as well. We are firmly in the lead here and we really excited about the data and this is our highest priority and notwithstanding that statement we are exploring the use palbo and a number of other tumor types as said including melanoma and lung cancer, et cetera these are primarily Phase 1 level studies and we are not reporting any data at this point.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, Geno.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Geno. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question. If I could turn back to PCSK9, if I may, might you help us out with the timeline for the completion of the outcomes trials and let us know if there are opportunities in those trials for early stoppage based on interim results? And then, could you also tell us what the dosing is, that\u2019s being used in the trial, is it once-a-month, twice-a-month, et cetera?","And then CAPiTA, if I might, could you just walk us through the steps that need to occur after you see the CAPiTA data to ensure that sales pick up? I know you have to wait for certain recommendations, certain buyers, I wondered if you could just walk us through that? And is there a scenario where that trial misses statistical significance on its primary endpoint, Mikael, but the trends are robust enough that you could still see a recommendation come out of the relevant bodies or do you really think you need to show statistical significance? Sorry for my long-winded question. Thank you.","Ian C. Read","So, John, if you can talk a little bit about PCSK9 again?","John Young","Okay.","Ian C. Read","And then we\u2019ll hand it over to I think, Geno, for the commentary on the CAPiTA.","Geno Germano","Okay. Thanks Mark. So obviously, it\u2019s fair to say that all of the PCSK9 programs are in relatively early stages of their clinical development. And as I mentioned and answered to an earlier question, one of the things that all of the programs, including ours will have to be determined as the data sets as they emerge and what will be required for approval, not something it will continue to have dialogue with the agency about it. So I think it\u2019s really premature to determine if there is any interim read-out of data that would lead to an earlier approval either a lipid-lowering indication or of the outcome indication. Mark, can you remind me of the second part of your question?","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Dosing.","Geno Germano","In terms of dosing, okay, so the dosing schedule that we are taking into our clinical program is a twice a month dosing schedule. So I would say you heard already from Mikael, we will be presenting the results of our Phase 2b study early next year and from the analysis that we\u2019ve done of that data so far \u2013 it\u2019s incomplete at this point. But certainly we believe that that twice-a-month dosing schedule actually provides really the optimal consistent cholesterol lowering right across the dosage interval in order to maintain the optimal clinical effect and ideally the optimal clinical outcomes. So we feel really positive about the twice-a-month dosing schedule being the optimal dosing schedule for bococizumab.","Ian C. Read","That being said, Mikael do you want to add on something about \u2013 some technology that we are excited about that?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, just based on excellent way in which John described our PCSK9 clinical strategy. It\u2019s a really well-behaving antibody and just twice monthly administration schedule is the logical on next step as John described. However, we think that as part of a potential lifecycle management strategy, there are opportunities to also explore once monthly schedule, that may include the use of technology such as Halozyme technology for which we have a exclusive license within the PCSK9 class.","And we are now performing early test on the suitability of that technology to extend half-life and also lower the volume that you need to inject. The antibody itself at high dose has the potential for once a month, but we would rather see a technology like this to give a really convenient opportunity. So as you can see as we go forward with twice months we have a lifecycle management potential to offer additional regimens.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you Mikael and Geno, CAPiTA.","Geno Germano","Sure, so with regard to the steps for CAPiTA, as we\u2019ve indicated we\u2019ve completed accumulation of a required the number of events, we are in the process now of finalizing the analysis of those events in completing the data management associated with creating our top line results and we are at the same time in discussions with the CDC and now the ACIP and pneumococcal working group to ensure they are understanding of the protocol and the potential outcomes so that when we have the data they can move on the data rapidly.","So we are in ongoing discussions with them and this is obviously in the United States. So when the data is available the working group will be exposed to the data and we will come \u2013 will do their - the grading process and prepare for bringing those data and their assessment to the formal ACIP Committee. And the ACIP Committee meets three times a year in February and June and in October, its unlikely that will have data available for the February meeting, but we are targeting the June meeting it could occur in June or it could occur in October.","So that\u2019s the U.S. situation, ex-U.S. in most cases we don\u2019t have the pneumonia indication in most ex-U.S. markets therefore the CAPiTA trial results will from the basis for the pneumonia indication and we will file those applications and depending upon the review times, we would expect to see the pneumonia indication up here in the 12 month to 14 month timeframe beyond those filings.","So hopefully that gives you some sense of the steps and the timing associated with CAPiTA. With regard to the outcomes, there are multiple endpoints including vaccine type non-bacteremic pneumonia, and vaccine type all-cause pneumonia or vaccine type pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease. So there are a number of different scenarios you can play out depending upon the outcomes. Obviously we\u2019re targeting the most favorable outcome which would be demonstration of effect, positive effect on prevention of vaccine type non-bacteremic pneumonia.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Geno. Moving on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities","Yes, couple of things. First, can you help us quantify the impact of these government purchases Prevnar and Enbrel and the lumpiness there and how that\u2019s going to impact the next quarter? Second, in China, I mean, it looks like the growth continues very strongly there. I mean, why are you not having the problems that some of the other players are having there? Can you just talk about the dynamics, or may be it is impacting you and the growth would have been even better? And then Geno may be you can just talk about some of the dynamics of the new oncology drugs that have launched and what\u2019s happening there and how those ramps are going? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","So, thank you Marc. If I understood the question you would like to understand some of the seasonality or lump seasonality, or lumpiness in government purchases of Enbrel and Prevnar. So perhaps if John can talk about that in the emerging markets and then deal with China. And then Geno if you will talk to Prevenar in the..","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities","The oncology and product.","Ian C. Read","in the oncology product.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities","In light as are going forward.","Ian C. Read","Thank you. All right, thanks Marc. Clearly there is some volatility. I think, if you heard that, the emerging markets while they clearly represent overall significant continued opportunities for growth, but we do see quarter-on-quarter volatility as you know and particularly it is in the area of government tenders. So without going into all the details, but to give you sort of sense some of the moving pieces, with Prevnar our IP shipments in Turkey this year for example, we certainly have seen a fall in sales in Turkey this year, we had NIP sales last year, we haven\u2019t seen those year-to-date.","In Brazil we\u2019ve seen a decreased institutional purchases for Enbrel and also for Prevnar and the AFME or Africa Middle East region. Enbrel in Brazil shows about a 2% decline this quarter and a 12% decline year-to-date just to give you a sense of the rhythm of the business in Brazil.","And I think, overall obviously the emerging markets represent half history of markets running the world, but I think the sort of high level sort of message is as we have always seen and will see some quarter-on-quarter volatility particularly in the area of institutional purchases. But overall, the performance the underlying performance of the business in the emerging markets for both Enbrel and Prevnar in 2013 remains very positive, but we have seen in those markets and calling Brazil and Turkey particularly some volatility over the third quarter.","In China we continue to operate as we have always operated, we are globally we operate with a heightened sense, in the strict sense of our compliance obligations I don't believe our business in China is being particularly affected by anything other than just the macro economic situations that are occurring in emerging markets. The growth has slowed up somewhat in China compared to the previous year, but continues to be robust and we continue to expect our Chinese business to perform well.","Geno Germano","Yes, just Marc a couple of comments on Inlyta and Xalkori which we are really pleased with the progress that\u2019s been made there for the quarter for Inlyta we did 83 million which is about 200% above what we did last year same quarter and a double-digit increase over our prior quarter about half of that's in the U.S. where we grew by about 50% relative to last year.","So we see a nice continued fairly robust uptake of Inlyta physicians are really pleased with this product patients are responding well. We have about a 30% share second line in the U.S. and about a 35% of share of second line in Japan. So we are doing well we think in many cases as future growth has come from expansion of use beyond academic medical centers and with oncologists sort of very familiar with the drug. And we think there is good opportunity for further growth there.","Xalkori also is becoming a great product, $73 million for the quarter, up about 25% from last year and about 10% from the previous quarter. The trick there is the same story; we need to get the diagnostic in full use. We are about 66% in the U.S. and a little bit less in Europe and Japan. So we'll continue to work on that, and continue to identify the appropriate patient and grow that business.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Geno. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.","Ian C. Read","Seamus, we can hear you.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","Sorry, can you hear me?","Ian C. Read","Yes, we can hear you fine.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","Okay, great. So, just first off on the potential moves as you know between now and 2017 how should we be thinking about the prospects. I know that there is a group at Pfizer that\u2019s I believe constantly looking at opportunities to do incremental separations. Do you see that as a possibility, is that something that Pfizer is consistently looking at between now and 2016 and do you see opportunities for value creation there I guess that\u2019s more question for Ian. And then separately on tanezumab, can you just update us again on where we stand with the anti-NGF scientifically the move forward in osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain and again how we should think about the potential changes in the development path as you partner with Eli Lilly? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","So we have set up the organizational construct, because we believe that is the best way to focus and maximize the different parts of our business as each segment represents my opinion in different models. It also gives us a lot of optionality going forward as we look at ways of creating shareholder value. So going back to your question, we\u2019re always looking of ways of maximizing shareholder value and I think this contract gives us the maximum optionality and ability to look at different ways of creating that value and we will take those decisions at the appropriate time as the opportunities mature. So with that I\u2019ll ask John to talk about tanezumab.","John Young","Okay. Thanks Seamus. So just to give you an update I think as you know in December 2012 the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the development of NGF inhibitors including tanezumab and that partial clinical hold was unrelated to the prior hold that related to bone and joint related safety. And that was based \u2013 the latest clinical hold was based on peripheral nervous system effects observed in animal studies conducted with NGF inhibitors by other manufacturers. In April this year we reached an agreement with the FDA on the path forward removal of that partial clinical hold, and to answer the questions which led to the partial clinical hold I do think it was initiated to demonstrate sympathetic nervous system safety and requisite non-clinical study in July of this year and that study is progressing on schedule.","So we intend to submit the results from that study in the first half of 2014 and assuming a positive review of the non-clinical data by the FDA and removal of a clinical hold, we are preparing to resume the Phase 3 studies for tanezumab early in 2014. So we are very excited about the deal that we\u2019ve announced today with Eli Lilly and we believe that represents a very positive opportunity for us to collaborate to take tanezumab into Phase 3 clinical development and ultimately we believe into the marketplace, which clearly has significant need and opportunity for new pain treatment options and so we\u2019re very excited about the potential for tanezumab assuming that we are able to deliver positive data from those non-clinical studies. So I hope that helps Seamus.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, John. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking the questions. First question for Frank, when you take a look at the Alliance revenue at least consensus estimates for Alliance revenue in 2014, 2015 I think they are around $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, are you comfortable with those numbers being where they are at in light of the exploration of the majority of your agreements. And then when you look at the consensus revenue estimate of $50.5 billion for 2014 or \u2013 can you just maybe walk us through some of the pushes, pulls or influencers on losses of exclusively that influence that number and are you comfortable with it. Secondly on Mylan Pfizer agreement that you have in Japan, can you help us understand some of the accounting around that and also the level of penetration that you have got into the generic market in Japan. A very attractive opportunity there, especially in light of what the Japanese government is trying to push there and then lastly, just a pipeline question on the SGLT2. Can you help us understand what the points of differentiation are especially in light of there being three other entrants potentially in that market before you enter and then any thoughts around the combination strategy that you might have with Januvia? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, John. So Frank, you want to\u2026","Frank A. D\u2019Amelio","Yeah.","Ian C. Read","Address some of the projections for the question.","Frank A. D\u2019Amelio","So, I think the way I\u2019ll do this for 2014 in total is maybe some of the headwinds and then some of the tailwinds. So in terms of headwinds, no surprises we continue to have some losses of exclusivity that will affect those in 2014. Enbrel entering the 36 months sunset period is one of them and Spiriva in Japan is another. So there will be some LOEs that we\u2019ll experience, that will impact 2014. We said previously $3 billion to $4 billion in LOE impacts for the next couple of years. That\u2019s clearly with what we are expecting for 2014.","If you look at some of the tailwinds we continue expect growth in emerging markets, some of our new products. We\u2019ve had some nice growth in Xalkori, Inlyta, Xeljanz. We expect to see new product growth continue in a steady and measured way and we\u2019ve had some nice performance in some of our inline products. Lyrica this quarter, Celebrex this quarter 11%, 13% globally. So lots of opportunities there and in terms of addressing headwinds in addition to the opportunity, the areas on the top line we\u2019ll continue to manage our cost of expense structure, we\u2019ll continue to use our balance sheet and our capital structure to help us manage beyond the LOE in revenue headwinds like we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years.","In terms of Alliance revenue, let me just run the numbers and then I\u2019ll answer the question. If you look at the alliance revenues this quarter, $700 million down from $900 million in the year-ago quarter, down 22%, year-to-date down 15%, $2.6 billion to $2.2 billion, the majority of the alliance revenues to-date are really from Enbrel and Spiriva. and going forward, the alliance revenues are going to come from Rebif, which is in the numbers today and then obliviously Eliquis growing.","So that will be the rhythm of the numbers relative to the alliance revenues, but clearly, on a going forward basis, the alliance revenues will be declining and they will be declining significantly. In terms of Mylan accounting, I think the simple answer is, we record the revenues from the products that are coming out of the arm collaboration. John, do you want to make any comment on the penetration in the market or is too early to\u2026","John Young","Yes, I mean I think it\u2019s really too early, John to talk about penetration and market shares, specifically other than to say that we are on track. we have seen the \u2013 we\u2019ve met all of our milestones in terms of the transfer of Mylan colleagues into the Pfizer organization. we are currently selling around about 250 products from the combined company\u2019s generic portfolios in the marketplace. and the project plan is in place to [indiscernible] to Pfizer distribution, which is the real strength of our organization in Japan and processes and work are in place to address any quality or supply risks. in terms of manufacturing and development, initiatives kicked off to build manufacturing capacity for collaboration volumes.","And I think overall message in Mylan is the joint venture is certainly progressing very much according to our plans. In terms of our ertugliflozin, as you know, we entered into a worldwide collaboration except Japan with Merck to develop and commercialize ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin containing fixed dose combinations with metformin and Januvia tablets. it\u2019s our innovative proprietary SGLT-2 inhibitor for treatment of type 2 diabetes and we are initiating Phase 3 clinical trials with our partner Merck.","I certainly don\u2019t want to comment in detail about competitors in this class. So I want to say that our two lead competitors have had probably a troubled regulatory pathway and the U.S. and Europe and we believe that the dialogue that we\u2019ve been able to have with the FDA as well as the strength of the molecule, certainly has enabled us to put together a development program combined with the strength of our partnership with Merck that gives us a very good runway into the marketplace.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, John. Mikael, do you want to comment on the technical aspects of our products and differentiation.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, let me build on the excellent discussion that John had on ertugliflozin. So it\u2019s highly selective molecule for the SGLT2 transporter and as you will learn when you explore that class, there is difference in the selectivity among the molecule. it\u2019s highly potent; it\u2019s a very low dose, which is really a key characteristic when you aim to combine with other drugs such as market leading Januvia and metformin is performing very well in the Phase 2 studies with robust lowering of HbA1c and also favorable effect on blood pressure. So we think really these unique characteristics of a best-in-class molecule combined with a long experience with Januvia allows for a very favorable long-term opportunity.","John T. Boris \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano","Our next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Two if I may? Ian, I wanted you to get your latest thoughts about entering the cancer immunotherapy market, perhaps partnering palbociclib in breast cancer with one of the leading of the PD-1s. it seems like that could be a pretty promising combination. And a follow-up, we\u2019ve recently heard some negative comments from your peers about entering the biosimilar market, including commercial risk. so I\u2019m just wondering what is it that made you confident to proceed with this early aggressive biosimilar strategy? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","So on the biosimilar market, each company takes its own view of the commercial opportunities. We feel that we have the technology and the ability to bring bisomilars to the market that will be very well characterized. We believe that in that marketplace, we don\u2019t see it reacting like the small molecule generic market. We believe it will probably act more like the sterile injectable market.","We bring to that commercialization, the credibility and the quality of Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing and research. and we think it is a reasonably low cost development opportunity for products that have a high commercial opportunity. So we think it\u2019s a good appropriate allocation of resources for the potential payoff. Geno, would you like to talk about the immunotherapy or and if you want pass to Mikael as well between the two of you.","Geno Germano","Okay. so I mean, Alex, obviously it\u2019s a really pretty active exciting time with all that\u2019s happening with the checkpoint modulators and using monotherapy in various combinations across many different tumor types. We see this as an emerging field with a lot of experimentation going on to identify appropriate patients and appropriate combinations. and we\u2019re actively exploring a number of mechanisms ourselves internally with our 4-1BB monoclonal antibody and some of the vaccine approaches that we have access to as well as looking at potential partnerships. Mike do you want to add?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, I think Ian has got it very well. We have of course, invested heavily in our signal-transduction inhibitors and as you mentioned palbociclib is one of the real example of potential breakthrough drugs here. But the ability to combine small molecule, large molecule with cancer immunotherapy is going to have very interesting potential and we have as Geno alluded to a number of internal activities, but they are also open for partnership which in general we have shown is a great way to grow value in this industry.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Mikael. Moving on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Ian talked to biosimilars you alluded to a notion that there would be some incremental R&D cost could you provide some color around that please. And then secondly if I may, one pipeline question on the Mening B 20,000 patient study could you provide some timing for total enrollment and when that might read out and moreover Michael do you need high tiders to both proteins in order to provide appropriate killing of the bacteria? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read","Tony, I wasn\u2019t quite sure of your question on the biosimilars, the incremental R&D expenditures inst per se because of biosimilars is because of the what I think I describe is a very, very strong cohort of Phase 3 products coming in develop in the near future and one that we are also \u2013 we are appropriate partnering to ensure that we maximize shareholder return. So Mikael, do you want to talk about the tider issue?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So thank you for the interest in Mening B and we do think it\u2019s a very important vaccine. It\u2019s a kind of the missing component in staph aureus [ph] meningococcal strains, the Meningococcal B. So we have three trials that are well underway, efficacy, safety and lot consistency trial. And we believe that you should aspire to raise the relevant prices to both proteins. Together these two proteins that were carefully selected during our development process, they will cover a great majority of meningococcal strain, which is a unique feature of our vaccine and we noticed in our Phase 2 trial a robust and good tolerability. As you know, we are focusing on adolescent population which is the main carrier of the disease.","Ian C. Read","Thank you. And Tony just to expand our biosimilar spend is we have been spending and its sort of in our baseline spend of our development program. So I didn't particularly see that as a driver of R&D spend.","Charles E. Triano","And Geno just on the timing of the enrollment rate I think we have comments there or meningitis B?","Geno Germano","We are enrolling now and I think we anticipate completing enrollment in the 2015 timeframe.","Charles E. Triano","Thank you. Our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Good morning. Couple of questions please. First Ian and Frank, back to portfolio management. Could you give us some guide to the total cost and the saving of those costs for the operational separation of the established products business. Just in helping us understand how optionality pans out. And then second to Mikael. Could you give us an update on the Phase 1 anti 4-1BB CD137 trial. It\u2019s been running for two and half years in a very refractory patient population. What's the chances we could get data prior to 2015. Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Andrew. Frank if you could sort of take us through the patients of restructuring and costs and the timing of that et cetera and then Mikael can answer the second question.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Yes. So I think in terms of implementation costs there are not material implementation costs. In fact as we look at the new structure there is some opportunities for synergies to the tune of couple hundred million dollars. Minimal amount in 2014 is we\u2019re basically getting the structure in place and we see an opportunity in 2015, 2016 to capitalize on the new structure and generate couple of hundred million in operational synergies. So that\u2019s how I think about the puts and the takes on that.","Mikael Dolsten","So for 4-1BB you know the mechanism links to activate the immune cells particularly T-cell mediated and you are right we have been exploring it for quite sometime to fully understand its property and we have studies ongoing \u2013 dose escalation studies both as immunotherapy and in combination with Rituximab in hematological patients. We are also looking at combination of full 4-1BB with other immunotherapy as part of our plan and we really share data as this protocol warps up at relevant conferences.","Andrew S. Baum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano","Will go to our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve M. Scala \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of follow ups with respect to the headwinds from the wind down in the Enbrel North America and Spiriva collaborations with an estimate of a $1 billion reduction in net income for these collaborations be a reasonable guess for all of 2014. so that\u2019s the first question. Second is, how do you assess the Herceptin biosimilar opportunity, given that the standard of care in HER2-positive breast cancer is evolving so quickly and that evolution may limit Herceptin\u2019s role overtime, meanwhile Roche says it will compete aggressively and there may be other biosimilar competitors as well. So it\u2019s a shrinking market with unknown number of competitors attractive. And then lastly, on the staph vaccine, you said data in 2014, on the second quarter of call, you had said data later this year, so any reason for that slight delay? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Frank, if you could comment on the Alliance revenue and then John on Herceptin and the nature of that marketplace and the pressures for managed care and I think Mikael on the timing.","Frank A. D\u2019Amelio","So on the alliance revenue, I ran the numbers before on Alliance revenue. We\u2019ll provide an update on the 2014 revenue number and the guidance for 2014 on our next earnings call. We\u2019ll incorporate into that number obviously, the impact of the Alliance revenue declined on a year-over-year basis. So on the next earnings call, we\u2019ll provide the details on 2014.","John Young","Okay. In terms of the question on biosimilars, almost by definition, biosimilars do lead clinical practice, they follow it. And so again, clearly today, we know that overall the biosimilars marketplace, the biotherapeutics marketplace is around about $100 billion marketplace globally for all biotherapeutics and that marketplace is expected to grow to around about $300 billion by 2019.","So I guess sort of first point to make in terms of our presence in the biosimilar marketplace is, biotherapeutics overall is a very significant opportunity and the biosimilar segment of that is expected to grow from its current value of around about $1.4 billion to potentially around, let\u2019s say $22 billion by 2020. So the key point to make there is, it is a big opportunity.","In terms of Herceptin, clearly, don\u2019t want to comment on our competitors and any additional therapeutic research that they are doing, allowing to say that, today Herceptin remains a standard of care for that particular patient population. And so at the point that we have a biosimilar available to enter into the marketplace, then we believe that that would be a potentially good option for physicians and healthcare systems for use in patients for Herceptin or that molecule trastuzumab is an appropriate clinical choice.","Charles E. Triano","Thank you. Mikael, on timing.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So we have completed successively Phase 1\/2 trial and our Herceptin is very good biosimilar version of the originator and we are now in the plans of starting a Phase 3 that we\u2019ll be initiating dosing within the next couple of months. And just to add to what John said, clearly as you discussed there will be always an evolving marketplace and in manner of these indications which are driven by a continuous flow of product. We do see still that many of these regimens include combination with Herceptin biologicals on top of Herceptin instead of traditional chemotherapeutics. And we anticipate that our molecule could offer a quality alternative.","Ian C. Read","On the Staph-aureus, I haven't looked at the transcript perhaps we misspoke I think perhaps we said we had data or internal data of Staph-aureus in that time period, but we intend to take it to a congress next year. So probably that was a confusion we created and if did we apologies for that.","John Young","I think that's right, Ian, it was presentation of the data.","Ian C. Read","Yes.","Charles E. Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. I just have two questions. First, with respect to the CAPiTA outcomes trial, could you just talk about the reason for the delay in the results, just sort of recap why it's been delayed so long. I am guessing you are going to say it's simply a winter cool, but is there anyway to read anything positive or negative into the delays relative to the expected timing when CAPiTA was started many, many years ago? And then separately with respect to biosimilar Herceptin, do you have agreement with the FDA on how that trial will be run in the U.S. and also when do you plan to file biosimilar Herceptin in the U.S. and ex-U.S.? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Geno, if you\u2019d like to talk about CAPiTA?","Geno Germano","Yes, I think on CAPiTA David you\u2019re right. I probably will say that it's event driven and when we have some -- we have the number of events but just to comment on a couple of factors the incidents of infection coincides with the severity of the flu seasons for example, so flu seasons have been milder then you may not have as many events and that can be a factor contributing to accumulation of events. And then there is overall efficacy or effectiveness of the vaccine. Obviously if the vaccine is extraordinarily effective then the only events that you're going to accumulate are the ones in the placebo group you won't accumulate any or very few in the vaccine group that would be a good problem to have and we will know soon what the real answer is.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Geno. John, could you talk about Herceptin.","John Young","Yes, so don't want to talk in detail about filing timelines but in terms of your question about the regulatory pathway, certainly the EU and U.S. have increasingly provided more guidance on the pathways for regulatory approval, which include extensive analytical and preclinical data, robust competitive clinical and immunogenicity data as well and that guidance is consistent with our development strategy for our portfolio of biosimilars including trastuzumab. So we anticipate a Phase 3 start for that program by the end of the year and will be progressing that program in line with our guidance as expeditiously as possible.","Ian C.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s second quarter 2013 performance. Joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer Business; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.","The slide that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Second Quarter 2013 which is located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during this conference call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today, July 30, 2013.","Also as we outlined in our earnings release, as a result of the full dispositions of Zoetis, the financial results of the Animal Health Business are now reported as a discontinued operation for the second quarter and year-to-date for both 2012 and 2013.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chuck. I will begin with some comments on the quarter. We saw solid operational revenue growth at a number of areas. Moving on Innovative business, oncology grew 28% driven by the uptick of new products, mostly Inlyta and Xalkori in several major markets and we saw strong performance from Lyrica in developed markets which grew 14% and Celebrex in U.S., which grew by 13%. The consumer business grew 5% operationally, primarily due to strong global growth from Centrum. And China had strong volume growth, most notably for Lipitor and Prevenar. Overall total China revenues grew 14% operationally or 22% excluding the impact of product transfers in connection with forming a partnership with Hisun.","We continually expect that the second half of this year will be stronger than the first half of emerging markets. Although on a full-year basis, we now expect to see operational revenue growth of mid single-digit rather than high single digits. It is mainly due to a slowdown in growth in Brazil and Russia and the impact of cost containment measures in Columbia, Polland, Thailand and Turkey.","We completed the full separation of Zoetis into a standalone public company. The transactions related to the disposition of Zoetis generated approximately $17.2 billion of after-tax value for Pfizer\u2019s shareholders. And our board of directors authorized a new 10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized overtime. This new program is an addition to the 3.1 billion of authorization remaining under the company\u2019s current repurchase program.","Turning to our products and pipeline assets, the launches of both Eliquis and Xeljanz continued progress in various markets around the world. And we are gaining market approvals to both Xeljanz and Eliquis in additional countries. We are encouraged with the potential for both of these therapies over the time. For Eliquis, we're focused on gaining preferred formulary acceptance, continuing to obtain reimbursement and building physician knowledge and comfort about the drug in this profile.","With this unique profile in atrial fibrillation is the only product with superiority versus Warfarin in stroke prevention, major bleeding and a proven mortality benefit, we're confident we will continue to see steady growth that will build overtime.","For Xeljanz, we're seeing good opportunities with patients who are switching from their current biologic therapy, as well as patients who are initiating Xeljanz's therapy and as a second-line setting. That is following the tricks before a biologic DMARD. In fact, almost half of our recent prescriptions are in the second line setting, with the remainder being patients who have been on one or more, biological DMARDs and not achieving satisfactory results.","In addition, we began our direct consumer campaign in the U.S. early in June and that's seen a subsequent uptick in prescription volume. Last month, we announced that the FDA had accepted for review our supplementary new drug application to include progression of structural damage in Xeljanz label and as of today, Xeljanz will be commercially available in Japan, where it'll be co-promoted by Pfizer and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.","Overall, we remain encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing what physicians and patients experienced so far. I would describe our progress as measured and steady and we recognize, it will continue to take time for rheumatologists to feel comfortable making a change. The launch is consistent with our expectations for new oral mechanism.","Turning to the status of Xeljanz in Europe, last week we announced The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the EU confirmed their prior opinions on marketing authorization applications for Xeljanz, although with a much closer vote. Given the novel mechanisms or action to Xeljanz, the CHMP wanted to see more data, particularly around safety to better understand the full profile of Xeljanz relative to other agents used in this patient population.","As a result of the reexamination process we addressed several of the questions and had more clarity on the remaining ones. We plan to work with European Medicines Agency to determine what additional data will be needed in order to resubmit a marketing authorization application and anticipate this will result in several years to lay.","Regarding the Xeljanz Phase III psoriasis program it continues to progress. However given the large size and complexity of this data set the analysis and reporting of the data have been more complicated than we anticipated. That said, there is no issue with the integrity of the data and this delay is purely due to operational issues. As a result, we now expect as the top line results from two of our four psoriasis ongoing studies by the end of the year.","One of the studies expected to read out this year evaluates maintenance of efficacy when patients are withdrawn from and then retreated with Xeljanz therapy. The second study compares the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz to Enbrel and placebo. We anticipate reporting the top line results from the two pivotal studies that will be part of our planned regulatory submission in the second quarter of next year.","For Prevnar sales this quarter were adversely impacted in the U.S. by the variability of CDC purchase patterns and a lower birth cohort in the U.S. as well as the end of a supplementary dose program in Asia. Regarding CAPiTA we continue to accumulate events and based on (indiscernible) spend rates we expect to complete the study this year. Given the size of the study, which is approximately 85,000 patients once the number of events is achieved it will still take several months to complete the necessary database validation and related activities prior to unblinding the results. Given where we are today we expect that we should see top line results in the first half of 2014.","As we announced yesterday, we are moving forward with formally internally separating our commercial and management structure into innovative and value business segments. And we will integrate emerging markets\u2019 fully into each of these segments.","One of the innovative business segments will be led by Geno Germano, who'll become Group President Innovative Products. This business segment will generally include products that have exclusivity beyond 2015 across multiple therapeutic areas consisting of immunology and inflammation including Enbrel, cardiovascular metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women's and men's health. XELJANZ and Eliquis, examples of products in this business.","The other innovative business segment will be led by Amy Schulman who will become Group President of Vaccines Oncology and Consumer Healthcare. Each of these businesses will operate in the separate global business. Each has a different operating model with the same specializations around science, talent and market approach.","The Value Product segment will be led by John Young. They will include the brands that have lost their exclusivity and generally a mature patent protected products are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most markets. Some examples include Celebrex, Zyvox, Viagra outside of the U.S. and Lyrica in the EU.","The Value business will also include our biosimilars portfolio and current and future collaborations for broadening our off patent portfolio, such as our existing partnerships with Mylan in Japan, Hisun in China and Teuto in Brazil. While we have decided to integrate emerging markets into the innovative value businesses, these markets will continue to play an important role in Pfizer's long-term success.","We see the fastest-growing emerging markets becoming more aligned with the profile of developed markets. With these changing dynamics we believe this is the right strategic to move for us at this time. I've asked Olivier Brandicourt to lead the transition from the current emerging markets business into each of the three business segments.","And with Amy becoming the Group President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare, we're appointing Doug Lankler currently our Chief Compliance and Risk Officer to be Pfizer's General Counsel. And additionally, Ray Johnson, Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel will become the new Chief Compliance and Risk Officer.","All of the leadership changes are effective January 1, 2014. We will be moving towards operating in the new commercial structure at the start of 2014 while we continue to manage our business and report our financial results and the existing structure for the balance of 2013. All the current leaders will continue in their roles for the remainder of this year.","Starting with a release of our financial results for the first quarter of 2014, we will provide greater transparency into the financial profile of each of the three new business segments. Our plan is to provide 2014 baseline management view of profit and loss to each segment. We anticipate providing additional financial detail as we move forward within a new structure effective January 1, 2015.","In summary, I believe this new commercial structure will put us in a better position to assess the capabilities, progress and opportunities, our innovative core and provide our value business dedicated resources required to fully strengthen and grow and position it to be a market leader.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details for the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio","","Thanks Ian, good day everyone. As always, the charts I\u2019m reviewing today are included in our webcast. Before I begin, I want to point out that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013; the financial results of the Animal Health business are now reported as a discontinued operation, and the condensed consolidated statements of income for the second quarter and year-to-date for both 2012 and 2013.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. Second quarter 2013 revenues of approximately $13 billion, decreased 7% year-over-year reflecting a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 4% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, most notably Lipitor and developed Europe for the second quarter of 2012, and multi-source generic competition for Lipitor in U.S. beginning in late May 2012.","The decline in Pfizer\u2019s share of revenues for the terms of the co-promotion agreements for Spiriva, which are in the final year in the U.S., Australia, Canada and certain European countries. The timing of government purchases of Prevenar in various markets and the transfer of certain product rights to our joint venture in China with Hisun in first quarter.","Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.56 decreased 5%, primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, primarily due to our ongoing share repurchase program.","Reported diluted EPS was $1.98 compared with $0.43 in the year-ago quarter. So, it\u2019s mainly driven by the pre-tax gain of $10.5 billion associated with the full disposition of Zoetis and to a much lesser extent by the Protonix patent litigation settlement and lower legal charges, which were partially offset by the previously mentioned decrease in revenues and a 5.1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate on reported income from continuing operations mainly attributable to the tax liability associated with the previously mentioned Protonix patent litigation settlement.","During the second quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets declined 2% operationally, primarily due to the timing of government purchases of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevenar in Turkey and the transfer of certain product rights to the Pfizer-Hisun joint venture in the first quarter. These were partially offset by strong volume growth in China, especially for Lipitor and Prevnar.","In these BRIC-MT markets, volume growth of 1% was more than offset by price reductions of 3% versus the year-ago quarter. In addition, foreign exchange negatively impacted BRIC-MT revenue by 1% in the second quarter of 2013. Revenue from all emerging markets increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights would transfer to our joint venture in China with Hisun, we would have had operational revenue growth of 5% in our emerging markets business and 22% in China, and BRIC-MT operational revenue would have been flat compared with the year-ago quarter.","Operational, biopharmaceutical revenue growth from all emerging markets business is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year to a high single-digit percentage. However, we now expect full year operational revenue growth and our emerging markets business to be in the mid single digit percentage due continued slowing growth in some markets as pricing pressures continue to build and governments take additional steps to contain rising healthcare expenditures.","As we previously stated, because of the continued volatility in emerging markets, we anticipate our performance in that business to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by 3% or $392 million, and had a net positive impact of 3% or $228 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 compared with the year-ago quarter.","Now, moving on to our 2013 financial guidance, we are reaffirming all components of our full year 2013 adjusted financial guidance that we updated on June 24 to solely reflect the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer. I want to remind everyone that the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of adjusted and reported diluted EPS reflects the net reduction of 405.1 million shares of Pfizer's outstanding common stock as a result of the exchange offer. Because the exchange offer was completed on June 24, we will recognize only a partial year benefit to our full year 2013 adjusted and reported diluted EPS.","As an additional reminder, when we completed the full disposition of Zoetis in June we announced that the expected impact of the removal of the full year 2013 financial contribution of Zoetis and the impact of the partial year benefit from the net reduction in shares of our outstanding common stock due to the exchange offer would result in a $0.04 decrease to the upper and lower ends of our projected range for 2013, adjusted diluted EPS.","Today, we\u2019ve also updated our 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance range of $3.07 to $3.22 to reflect the gain associated with the full disposition of Zoetis, and income from the previously mentioned litigation settlement.","Now moving on to key takeaways. Second quarter results reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products in various geographies as well as the continued volatility in emerging markets.","As I previously mentioned, we expect high single-digit operational revenue growth in emerging markets during the second half of 2013, and now expect mid single-digit growth for the full year.","We continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share repurchases. We completed the full disposition of Zoletis during the second quarter, and we accepted 405.1 million shares of Pfizer common stock in exchange for our remaining interest in Zoetis.","We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive to reported and adjusted diluted EPS on a full year basis in 2014. We are reaffirming all components of our 2013 adjusted financial guidance, we remain excited about the potential of our new product launches in mid-to-late stage pipeline. We\u2019ve announced our intention to implement the new commercial structure beginning in fiscal 2014, which we except will better position Pfizer in long term success, and we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.","In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of our common stock. To date in 2013, we have repurchased approximately 8.7 billion or approximately 309 million shares and have $13.1 billion remaining under our current authorization. And we continue to expect the repurchase in the mid teens of billions of dollars of our common stock this year, despite the blackout period for share repurchases during and for 10 business days after the Zoetis exchange offer period. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Frank and Ian for the update. Operator, can we please now pull for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris T. Schott \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on the corporate structure. Can you just elaborate a little bit on why three divisions here as compared to simply the innovative and value core franchises you've discussed in the past. I guess is there \u2013 I know you\u2019re talked about the \u2013 is there a scenario where Pfizer could break itself into three companies at some point in the future.","And then my second question was \u2013 and just so I am clear can you elaborate a little bit more on what type of P&L granularity we should be anticipating in 2014 and then maybe even looking forward to 2015 for this three operating divisions? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chris. So, why the three rather than two. Well, I think it basically is very strong operational reasons that the innovative business under Geno has a collection of large disease areas that cut across both the primary care and specialty and they have challenges both capital allocation and of the go-to-market model as we look to be more efficient in how we deliver the message and how we get to see primary care physicians. Whereas the oncology business and the vaccine business have a very distinct culture, they\u2019re smaller businesses that I wanted to make sure that you can get, didn\u2019t get assumed into a large primary care business. They have specific customers, they have dedicated search facilities and research focus and I thought it was very important for those business to maintain their unique focus and extend it globally. So, that was the primary reason for maintaining or claim a structure where we had two innovative businesses.","On the details, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Yeah. So, Chris, on the P&L granularity for \u201914 and then as about beyond 2014. For 2014 fiscal year, we will show revenue for each of the three businesses. We\u2019ll show direct cost and we\u2019ll show direct expenses and then what we\u2019ll do is on expenses that we don\u2019t allocate today that we don\u2019t allocate to come fiscal 2014, we\u2019ll provide some qualitative directional statement. So, that you will be able to model some good full stream P&Ls. Come fiscal 2015, we'll provide that same information and then we\u2019ll provide some additional balance sheet information as well. So, that\u2019s kind of the rhythm of how we\u2019re thinking about this.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Sure. On the separation, was curious, as you internally separate these businesses, are you considering any changes that could affect the overall tax structure at Pfizer? Then on Palbo, I've a couple of questions. By when will you know that you might not have data in time for San Antonio? I assume it's some time before the actual start of that conference. So, let us know if there's a key date there. And Lilly has a program that's much earlier in that class, but they talk about the ability of their product to be dosed continuously. Any comments on that subject of continuous dosing versus otherwise? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","Great, thank you. I will ask Frank to comment on the tax issue.","Frank A. D'Amelio","So in terms of the tax structure, the creation of these three businesses in and up themselves does not impact in any material way the tax structure, but we are always doing tax planning to see what we can do to be more efficient from a tax perspective.","Ian C. Read","And if, Geno could you respond to the questions on Palbo?","Geno Germano","Yeah, I mean, with regard to the timing on Palbo, we\u2019re continuing to accumulate events, and based on the rate of accumulation that we\u2019re seeing at this point, we think it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll be presenting data at San Antonio. So, I don\u2019t have a specific date to give you, but I think our best view at this point is, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll present at San Antonio. We still expect to accumulate the required events around the end of the year, but unlikely we\u2019ll meet the San Antonio date. And then with regard to continuous dosing, I\u2019m really not sure and familiar with the Lilly program. So, I can\u2019t really comment on that.","Charles E. Triano","","Thanks, Geno. Next question please?","Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions on the split up. Can you give us a very rough preliminary idea of how operating margins might compare across those different businesses, could establish products had the highest margins because those products seem to kick off a lot of cash and don\u2019t require a lot of support even directional guidance on this sort of thing would very helpful because that\u2019s what folks, I think, are going to be interested in as we head into 2014?","And then separately you\u2019ve talked about meeting three-years of audited financials before you could potentially truly split up the Company if that\u2019s what you\u2019re ultimately destined to do. There\u2019s been some speculation that perhaps you could use historic data for this three-year requirement, which means you wouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2017 or so until we really carve it up. Is this a possibility, should we really think of 2017 as being the earliest you could really split things up?","Ian C. Read","","Well, I\u2019ll ask Frank to answer the margin issue the best he can and also your hypothetical question on data needed to split.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Sure. So, let me answer the second question first, which is on data requirements. If we were ever to decide to do something external to the Company, obviously we haven't decided anything yet, and which is, it requires three-years of audited financials and our current thinking is those would be prospective. And the thought of trying to retrospectively create those, when we look at everything that we need to be done is, would be extremely difficult. So, the current thinking is clearly that those will be prospective in terms of the three-years of audited financials. So, that's how I'd answer the second question.","On the first question on operating margins, the way I think about this is we're going to provide 2014 guidance. We're going to stop providing more granularity relative to these three businesses. So, Tim for the time being I really don't want to start projecting the margins on those businesses until we start showing them from 2014 and that will give lots more clarity when that time comes.","Ian C. Read","Thanks Frank.","Charles E. Triano","","Next question please, operator.","Operator","","The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just to follow-up on that last question. Frank is there a difference in SEC requirements for a spin versus a split. And then a question for you Ian on M&A, you've done an amazing job returning cash to shareholders, which we've all strongly applauded. But you also say that with respect to M&A that you would always use share buybacks as the case to be, but with your stock at a 12 to 13 multiple there really is no case to beat relative to a share buyback. So I am wondering, how you are thinking about M&A going forward especially as it relates to the potential to split the Company into multiple parts that might require more growth drivers or M&A activity? Thanks.","Frank A. D'Amelio","","Thank you. So, on the BD issues we look at BD not as a strategy but as a way of creating shareholder value and strengthening cost of our franchises or portfolio. We always try to analyze it sort of in the light of new capabilities or strengthening capabilities we already had. We\u2019ve tended to talk in terms of bolt-ons and you\u2019d have to think that bolt-ons would be you\u2019d easily consider single-digit in billions of bolt-ons for this company. And we\u2019ve also said, we\u2019ll look at any type of acquisition, never say never to larger acquisitions that made sense.","Regarding when would we consider our share price to be at a level that BD would be more effective. Well, you know, it depends on what deal we are looking at in BD, how it\u2019s priced and where our expectations are of our multiple is going in the next two to three years. So, I don\u2019t know I can answer that in a hypothetical way, but more in a look at each case by case. We look at each deal. We\u2019re active in looking at deals. We can pair to what we think the value of buybacks are and we take the decisions on a deal by deal basis. Do you want to add anything to that, Frank?","","Frank A. D'Amelio","Yeah, let me just add quickly to that and then I\u2019ll answer the question about split versus spin which, and Jamie when we look at deals remember in terms of the case to [BP] in buybacks, it\u2019s also over what timeframe. So, is it year one, is it year two and then, well, how do we feel about the certainty of being able to achieve those EPS projections based on assumptions on synergies and the like. So, in my mind to Ian\u2019s point, it\u2019s deal by deal situational and then over what timeframe do we see that being, I\u2019ll call it, accretive relative to the buybacks. And then the terms of the split versus the spin question and is there any difference in required financials, the answer is no. Both scenarios require three years of audited financials.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thanks, Frank.","Charles E. Triano","","Operator, can we move to the next question please?","Operator","","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","","Hey guys. Excuse me. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Maybe I can build on Jamie's question around use of cash, I think in the past I've heard you say things like your priorities for cancer vaccines and also general practitioner drugs, I wondered if you could clarify or confirm that and when you say, you never say never do a larger deal, maybe you could just expand on that, is that just a theoretical statement or is that something that we should be thinking about as possible move for Pfizer? And then, under the new structure, have you decided will BD be centralized or each unit have independent BD M&A functions within them? And then, maybe just quick R&D if I can, do you expect the NGF antibody to return to clinical development? Thank you","Ian C. Read","","Okay, so, you asked about BD by segment. Clearly, BD that builds on a capability, it allows you to synergize your expense space, is how easy they get done than BD when you're going to a totally new space.","So, while we look at any good intellectual property that we could bring to patients and use our capabilities to bring to patients, they're easy to get done, if you've got some inherent synergies. On a big deal, all I would say is, look we're focused on creating value for shareholders and you do the analysis and you look at the risk and you look at the uncertainties and you make your decisions as you go forward. We've been up-till-date primarily focused on bolt-ons.","Frank, do you want to talk about the BD? Certainly, I would say, part of the rationale for creating these goal businesses is that, I now feel I can have management teams tasked on creating both organic and inorganic growth, and they're obviously going to have close ties and working with our BD organization. Frank, do you want to add to that?","Frank A. D'Amelio","Sure. On the BD org structure question, the way we approach this is, the BD resources are centralized, however there's matrix from a client support perspective. So, when you look at any of the businesses, they'll have folks that are dedicated to them, that literally from a business perspective are on their team. Who they report to, from my perspective, is irrelevant. We matrix, this in such a way that their reporting is transparent. They're living with those folks. They're collocated with those folks. They're working with those folks on a dedicated day-to-day basis. That's how we do it, quite frankly for just about all of our enabling functions.","Ian C. Read","John you want to add something?","John Young","Yeah, thanks for the question about tanezumab, which is our NGF antibody. Just sort of a quick update on that, on the 19 of July this year, we actually received notification from the FDA that the partial clinical hold for tanezumab has been lifted. You may know that the partial clinical hold have been placed on the development of all the NGF inhibitors back in December 2012 based on observation and some animal tox studies conducting in NGF inhibitors in development through other manufacturers.","So, there partial clinical hold was lifted on a commitment by Pfizer to submit non-clinical data before initiating dosing in clinical trials and thereafter limiting dosing duration until the additional non-clinical data has been submitted and reviewed by the FDA. So, those record at non-clinical data studies have already been started and with the lifting of the partial clinical hold and on the assumption of a positive review of the non-clinical data by the FDA, we're preparing for resumption of Phase III clinical studies in 2014.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. First on the R&D and perhaps M&A\u2019s front, either for Ian or Geno. Could you comment on the extent to which cancer immunotherapy is a priority for you? And then, for Frank, you\u2019ve obviously returned a lot of cash to shareholders in terms of buybacks, but any thoughts on the dividend increase, given your relatively low payout ratio? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Mike, do you want to take the R&D question?","Mikael Dolsten","So, we have a broad effort in quality in immunology and we certainly have interest also in the cancer immunology area. On one hand we some vaccines in the cancer immunology area that are starting to move into pre-clinical development, but we also have some monoclonal antibodies. Let me mention the 4-1BB or CD137 checkpoint activating antibody that we now have in Phase 1 study in hematological and solid tumors and are following with quite some interest that are antibody and other assets.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Mikael. Frank, do you want to\u2026?","Frank A. D'Amelio","","Dividend?","Ian C. Read","Dividend.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Sure. So let me just run the numbers on the dividend and then I\u2019ll answer the question which is when we announced the Wyeth acquisition back in 2009, we cut the dividend in half, from $1.28 to $0.64. Since then we\u2019ve increased the dividend 2009 to 2010, 2010 to 2011, 2011 to 2012, 2012 to 2013 from $0.64 to $0.72 to $0.80 to $0.88 to $0.96. 12.5%, 11%, 10% and 9% dividend increases over the last four years.","Our cadence is always at our December Board meeting. We typically \u2013 Ian and I make a recommendation to the Board relative to what we expect or what we want the dividend to be for the following year. Once the Board approves that we come out with a release to let everyone know what the new dividend will be. That\u2019s what we are expecting to do this year.","And then in terms of just absolute dollar amounts, at the current dividend level we\u2019ll be paying more than $6 billion in cash to our shareholders this year.","So big number and you mentioned the payout ratio, if you use the mid-point of our guidance and then use the $0.96 you get about 45% which is roughly in line with the industry, maybe a couple of points below. But we've been closing that gap over the last couple of years with our increases.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Frank.","Charles E. Triano","","Our next question please.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","First is PCSK9 the subcu I think we are supposed to hear about that in mid-year, just wondering an update there. Second on Xeljanz I know you are working on a once daily version I was curious if you could update us there. And then there were a couple of products in the U.S. that were very strong, Lyrica and Celebrex, were their stocking that drove out or can you help us there? Thanks.","Ian C. Read","","Okay, Mikael do you want to talk about PCSK9 results and then Geno will talk about Xeljanz and John on Lyrica and Celebrex.","Mikael Dolsten","","Yeah, so, thank you for the interest in PCSK9. We do believe there will be a limited number of entrants in this new drug class. We think it has potential to be a very important drug class with substantial, clinical and commercial potential. Key here will be to over time demonstrate important to see the outcome value for the patients, physicians and payors.","Our own antibody is now fully enrolled in Phase IIb and we'll soon complete that study. We have seen interim results showing potent antibody with a competitive profile, and we will assemble all the data from the Phase IIb and look at opportunity for subcutaneous delivery at various time intervals and make a decision at end of this year about the next step forward.","Geno Germano","","Thank you Mikael. With regard to the XELJANZ once-a-day program, we do have a delayed release formulation that we\u2019re moving forward with. We\u2019ve had dialogue with the FDA on the development plan and we have determined that the registration package will be comprised primarily of pharmacokinetic data, PK data without a requirement for a clinical Phase 3 trial, which will accelerate the development of that program. So, we expect to be filing by early 2015.","John Young","","Mark, with regard to your question about the operational performance of Lyrica and Celebrex, essentially both products have seen strong operational growth in the quarter and year-to-date. We haven\u2019t seen any effect of stocking or changes in inventory levels in the marketplace. In fact, those have been very steady, and really the performance that you\u2019re seeing is really just a reflection of the combination of both price and volume in the U.S. and a value proposition that continues to resonate very well with physicians.","Charles E. Triano","","Thanks, John. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. I have three questions on the new business structure and then a pipeline question. So, first, is it dilutive to create three business units and build the matrix, and enabling functions? Second, could you discuss breaking up the sales forces in emerging markets and implying them to the new segments? And then third, regarding the three years of audited financials, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s to affect tax free exits, but would you consider divesting one of the units, for example, established products before you have three years of audited financials or is that just not realistic given the necessity to ensure tax-free transactions. And then for Mikael, could you just tell us what the key pipeline disclosures are to watch through year-end including whether you\u2019re going to provide any updates on your Breakthrough Therapy discussions with the FDA on Palbociclib. Thank you.","Ian C. Read","","So, we don't believe this new structure will be dilutive to our present structure. In fact, we assume that there will be some modest savings, as we go to that structure. You have to remember, we already have in the developed markets, we already have a primary care, a specialty care vaccines and oncology business and then we have an emerging markets business in the rest of the world and we are effectively collapsing most of the primary care and specialty business into one BU. So, we do not believe that those standing up to those BUs are going to be dilutive.","On the field force in the emerging markets, it really depends country by country, but if you take a country like China, the vast majority of the field force will fit in the value business and we will have internal service agreements to provide field force support for the innovative products. I do not see that at all as an operational issue it's something we've been doing for quite some time is sharing field forces between BUs.","I'd ask Frank to talk about the three-years and the possibility of divestiture prior","to that and then we'll go to Mikael.","Frank A. D'Amelio","","So, on the tax-free question that you asked, Dave, way I\u2019ve been, I think about this is tax is aside, we\u2019ll need to follow \u2013 if we would ever do anything externally, we haven\u2019t decided, we would need to follow registration statement, those registration statements require three years of audited financials, so that\u2019s the way I think about that.","In terms of something prior to three-years of audited financials, now our current thinking is this is all about getting these three businesses to hum internally, top rates with excellence inside the Company and our current thinking is all around three-years of prospective financials that would be auditable.","Mikael Dolsten","So, David thank you for your interest in our pipeline and I'm very excited about the pipeline both short-term and over the next couple of years. With the focus on this year, we already touched upon our phase 2b PCSK9 that will get data readout in \u2013 during this second half of the year.","Fairly as Ian has touched upon the two trials that we'll have a read out this year that will give us some first insights, how Xeljanz is performing this new indication. We also have I would like to say in psoriasis a topical study that now is running which I think is a very interesting further exploration of Tofacitinib. You heard about Prevnar in adult that we are expecting to complete during the later part of this year.","Within the vaccines franchise we are also now in the finalization of our reports from staphylococcus aureus PUC trials that we will share during the latter part of this year. I'm very encouraged by the profile I have seen so far, when it comes to this unique technology that we are deploying for a very broad immune response to stop aureus. In oncology, we have the two dacomitinib trials for second third line and third line or fourth line that we expect to have data this year that we'll be probably shared early next year. And you have heard earlier Geno\u2019s comment on Palbociclib that we expect to have the final pieces of the data coming together this year, and we have previously had very good dialogs with FDA on the breakthrough designation. So, we expect to continue a very close dialog and our guidance how to best use those data to the benefit of patients. And on top of that in Phase II, let me just point to couple of intriguing areas.","We have a best-in-class IL6 antibody and very long-acting antibody with a good potency and we expect read outs this fall in Lupus and late next year in Crohn's. We have a read out in COPD related to a piece of data inhibitor. We have our second biosimilar that have a readout this year Rituximab. We have earlier communicated positive data from our first biosimilar product Herceptin. And then, we\u2019re broadening our inflammation efforts to also involve the intersection of cardiovascular disease with a readout from a novel PDE5 inhibitor in chronic kidney disease. So, I do look forward to share with you the output from all of these studies in the next years to come.","Ian C. Read","Excellent. Thank you, Mikael. Good comment, our next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Some brief questions on the new structure if I may, if we could back to the notion of business development, and if we use an example say in established products with your partnership with the Brazilian company Teuto, I believe there is an option to actually buy the entire company. So, the question is, is that a decision by John Young and his Group. They make a recommendation to you, Ian and Frank and the Board, how does that capital actually get allocated if that were to occur?","The second question is around R&D to the structures is 100 \u2013 this may seem silly, but is the 100% of the R&D allocated to these three structures and I say this because I might, if they were split apart one could argue if all are should go in one of the innovative areas versus one of the others or not at all could be less then?","And then, similarly in the established products group with respect to R&D allocation, I could actually argue under the Pfizer umbrella there is very little R&The, but yet I suspect they were standalone if you look at Teva and Mylan as examples, 6% of total, 6.8% of total revenue is actually R&D. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand when we see this in January, Frank, how does it actually look, if you could provide some additional granularity? Thanks again.","Ian C. Read","On Teuto, what the global business units will do is they will be champions of projects and BD, but we need to maximize the use of BD across the Pfizer portfolio. So, the decision is taken at the corporate level and the BU leaders have to champion the deals.","On the R&D, clearly there are parts of R&D that are specific to the BUs and parts that are general infrastructure underneath it and I think we\u2019ll work through that as we go. I\u2019ll ask Frank to comment on that.","Frank A. D'Amelio","So Tony, let me provide a little more granularity and see if this is helpful, which is \u2013 so, before, when I talked about direct expenses to the new businesses, clearly the post-POC expenses that are in the business units today, would continue to be in the business units tomorrow. Then, if you look at, I\u2019ll call it the pre-POC spend that we have, that resides in Mikael's organization today, and what we call WRD, Worldwide Research and Development, that doesn't get allocated to the business units today.","We're looking at how best to guide you all relative to that spend, and that's the stuff that we're working our way through, and we'll work our way through that through the year and obviously give you guys updates as we go, but we are looking at how best to basically, how best to communicate that to you all, so that you can model this appropriately, kind of point one.","Then, you mentioned DP, and if I could give you a little bit more direction, the answer is, of course I can. If you look at the overall R&D spend, the value of business as a percentage of revenue will have a lower spend, and innovative co-businesses as a percentage of revenue and once again, and how we best direct and guide you all for next year is some of the sub-ledger detail that we're working our way through.","Ian C. Read","And Tony, this is part of the, one of the benefits, I expect to get out of having global businesses with Presidents who are champions, so the R&D today that would probably go to establish a smaller type of R&D that is safety, registration, regulatory some of biosimilars, and then some work around special formulations and that type of work. John's role will be to look at that and as you say compare it to what he needs to do it to drive growth and look at competitors in our Q4 capital allocation is appropriate into his R&D and this is what the benefit you get out of this type of focus on businesses.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Ian. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve M. Scala \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","","Thank you. First on Xeljanz, the CHMP is seeking longer term safety data or is there a potentially rare and\/or serious issue that they are requiring clarification upon? Secondly, is CAPiTA's delay due to a lower than expected event rate or is it due to some other reason? And then thirdly on emerging markets, may we anticipate high-single digit growth will return in 2014 and beyond or is this a business where mid-single digit growth is more likely? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Geno?","Geno Germano","Yeah, Steve, so, with regard to CHMP and XELJANZ, obviously we\u2019re somewhat disappointed at the outcome following what was really a positive scientific advisory group meeting and a positive view from the rapporteurs this time around. Ultimately CHMP members, at least some of the CHMP members, a small majority wanted to see additional safety data and in particular wanted to understand kind of the full profile of Tofacitinib with a new mechanism of action relative to other agents that are used in this patient population. So it's not entirely clear whether we\u2019re looking for longer term data or a larger database.","As you know, we continue to collect safety data. We have long term extension trials. We have registries. We have a post-marketing study that we are kicking off from the U.S. registration. So we have multiple ways and then of course we have psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis programs. We have a number of mechanisms to generate additional safety data and we\u2019ll obviously continue to do that. It\u2019s not entirely clear at that moment what we\u2019ll need to do achieve a registration. We do anticipate we\u2019ll need to do some additional clinical work, and as Ian mentioned before, we think this could require several years of delay in Europe. So that\u2019s the best way I can kind of characterize the situation there with the CHMP.","With regard to CAPiTA, it\u2019s difficult to predict what the event rate is going to be. It is going to depend on various dynamics like the severity of the flu seasons, the efficacy of the vaccine. So if it\u2019s a highly effective vaccine then the only cases that you\u2019re accumulating are cases in the placebo growth. So it\u2019s difficult to predict and we becoming very close to the target number of events and hope to be able to present more clarity in the very near future.","And On EM, we've always said that EM will be volatile. And we'll see swings in quarter-on-quarter and even year-to-year. I mean we'd all agree that secularly that\u2019s where we are seeing the vast majority of volume growth that\u2019s coming from in the foreseeable future as these economies continue to spend more on health care and the growth rate is going to fluctuate depending on how the volume is doing and what pricing pressures you are getting in the quarter. And so I would say it's really too early to tell or to reset expectations for where we think long-term growth in the emerging markets are going to go and we'll look at in our 2014 guidance. But overall we continue to be very bullish on the underlying demand for healthcare in emerging markets.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Jim. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","","Yeah good afternoon. Couple of questions, first on the immunotherapy assays, you mentioned Mikael the CD137, when do we get the first read out in NHL is that next year? And then, same topic, before you divested Tremelimumab to Astra you obtained some rights, perhaps you could outline what invitation you have retained?","And then separately for Ian, one of your competitors is having very visible issues in China, to what extent do you think that the ongoing investigations over fraud are going to impact pricing or demand in that market?",".","Ian C. Read","Okay, Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten","We're now running the Phase Ib studies here with our 4-1BB. We think we'll have a real interest in antibody and we have seen some encouraging early signs of activity here. I would expect as we finalized the Phase I studies here we will use conventional on-quality conferences to report outcome. We also have behind it a couple of other antibodies, such as OX40 and [Gitter].","So you should see it as second wave of checkpoint inhibitors trying to benefit from the early anti-cells around the PD-1 space but building on that and bringing the field further on.","Tremelimumab, we did retain particularly rights to use it for vaccines, and I shared with you some anti-cells about our cancer vaccine platform, and I can inform you that it do include Tremelimumab as one of the options for adjuvant effect on cancer vaccine. So, that was a really good way for us to plan, when we did that retention.","Ian C. Read","Thank you. And on China, I can't really comment on individual cases. I would say what we've seen in China is that clearly as government, focusses in spending more on healthcare. They clearly want to be good buyers of value of pharmaceuticals, so we'd expect to continue to have robust conversations and debates with them as we go forward, as to the value of the innovation we bring. I think you'll continue to see as they\u2019ve been doing, they do price reviews of segments of the market and they reset prices and normally, volume responds to different price points. So I think that will continue in China, as we go forward.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks you Ian. Moving on, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. First, can you talk a little bit about how you are going to be thinking about cost of goods and some of the overlapping dynamics there, is this a situation where Pfizer might consider a co-bottling or [Lonza] type structure over time, should the units be split out or how is that going to operate as we think about it?","Separately, can you also talk a little bit about Europe and infrastructure there, relative to the overall industry's profitability, one of your competitors commented on that and I think that might be particularly relevant as perhaps particularly relevant for Geno's business unit?","And then finally, as it relates to the emerging markets, Ian you mentioned specifically that you see the emerging markets \u2013 some of the larger emerging markets starting to operate more similarly to the developed markets. Can you just give us a little bit of a better sense in what regard that is, is it on distribution, reimbursement what is it specifically and are we talking about more similar to the U.S. or more similar to Europe?","Ian C. Read","Thank you. So on the cost of goods, about in terms of absorption, 50% of our plans are absorbed through the value business and 50% are absorbed through the innovative business. There are a limited number of plans that are specific to one business or the other. So I would expect that internally simply a cross supply issue between the plans and if there was anything ever externally done, I think this is easily handled by supply agreements. Today Pfizer purchases about 30% of its requirements from external suppliers. So, this is easily handled in the ordinary course of business.","The next question was Europe and infrastructure, look the pricing squeeze that Europe has applied to the industry over the last few years, which has accelerated from low-single digits to mid-single digits is, of course, pushing companies to look at what their infrastructure is, how they deliver the educational messages decisions and their investment in general, part of our restructuring into the innovative one, innovative two and the value business, a response of that in the set we effectively are merging our primary care and our specialty BU into one. So, I expect in Europe, you'll continue to see pharmaceutical companies look for more cost efficient ways to deliver their message, to physicians.","And on the EM issue, I think if you look at Turkey, you can see Turkey has gone to a full reimbursement model, more like Europe, this out of pocket has now become less important in Turkey. The government is more influential, so they tend to be more dominant in the way they make acquisitions of pharmaceuticals and their pricing requests.","In sophistication, I talk really about the way the markets have been regulated in terms of compliance, in terms of the rules that are similar in Europe and the U.S., so I just see these markets evolving and also you're beginning to see more commonality and the requirements, they ask for registration, and that's really the sense of my comment about their evolving to looking more like mature markets.","Charles E. Triano","","Thanks, Ian. And Operator, if we could please take our last question?","Operator","Your final question comes from Damien Conover from Morningstar.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar Research","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a question on the restructuring. Wanted to see how products would flow from the innovative pieces to the value piece post-2014, and whether or not there\u2019d be any precedent set up for any sort of transfer of value that could be used if the entity is actually fully separated. And then second question on the break up was just a question on the consumer health business, and if I remember correctly, one of the driving reasons to have that business within the Pfizer umbrella is to help with any sort of RX to OTC switches and given that it\u2019s going in the vaccine and oncology bucket, I still wanted to know if that RX to OTC switch was still a major driving force behind that business underneath the Pfizer umbrella? Thank you.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Damien. So, I think the movement of products between the businesses will continue as they have been in the last three years as products that are innovative one, [go whether] we will move them over to the value business and they\u2019ll be managed that way. Any hypothetical situation where there was \u2013 the two businesses weren\u2019t in the same corporate shell, then you would make your decisions based on what\u2019s the best way to continue to commercialize those products at a later date, but that\u2019s really very early to speculate on. And then, Amy, would you like to take the consumer.","Amy W. Schulman","With respect to the Type 1 that we have for RX to OTC switches, we continue to see feel very comfortable with the pipeline. It\u2019s robust and assuming regulatory approval we\u2019ll proceed with the [DEXIN] launch in 2014 and then we have a number of other promising molecules in the pipeline, some of which we talked about previously.","Damien Conover","","Great.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2016 performance. As usual, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research & Development; Albert Bourla, President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed on our home page at Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Second Quarter 2016, and this is located in the For Investors section, which is in the lower right-hand corner of the page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, included in Part One, Item 1A, Risk Factors. And this is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at SEC.gov and at the Pfizer website, Pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.","In addition, discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, August 2, 2016. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","We'll now make prepared remarks; then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline.","Our financial performance year to date is strong. Even stripping out the impact of the legacy Hospira business, we reported another quarter of operational revenue growth that is driving our solid EPS performance. We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products, in addition to patent-protected products that are later in their lifecycle, as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products' loss of exclusivity. As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into two distinct business: an innovative business we now call Pfizer Innovative Health, and an established products business we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first six months of the year, the business are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results.","A few words about each. For Pfizer Innovative Health, we continue to see strength in our core brands, including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica, and Chantix.","More specifically, Xeljanz has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter two of 2015.","Eliquis's utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the number one prescribed oral anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter were strong, representing 75% operational year-over-year growth and 9% year-to-date operational growth.","Regarding Ibrance, approximately 35,000 patients have now been treated by 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year, and it's now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 million and for the first six months of the year totaled $942 million.","Our Prevnar 13 franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65-and-plus population had been vaccinated as of the end of June. Achieving year-over-year growth is now more difficult because of the reduction in the number of U.S. adults over 65 who have not received their Prevnar 13 shot. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for the full year will be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels.","During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition, which was a nice complement to our inflammation\/immunology portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example of the type of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions that enhance our portfolio with a pipeline product that is potentially close to market launch.","In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as immuno-oncology, CV\/metabolic, vaccines, I&I, rare diseases, neuroscience, and pain. In immuno-oncology, we have started Phase 3 studies for avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to the numerous existing studies already underway for the compound. Together with our partner Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter three 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in the EU.","In CAR-T, we're working with Servier on a joint clinical development program for UCART19, a product developed by Cellectis. We have exclusive rights from Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States. And, in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase 1 pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial, marking the first clinical trial of UCART19.","And last week we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio with our entry into a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We will collaborate with them on the preclinical and clinical development of a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12, through Phase 1 trials. Following the completion of the Phase 1 trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12.","Moving to our oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase 3 study for inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to pursue regulatory submissions. And, if approved, inotuzumab could be a valuable new addition to current available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a five-year survival rate of less than 10%, making these patients particularly difficult to treat.","We also continue to see success with Xalkori. It is now the first and only FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of the ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial of 50 patients, two-thirds responded to the treatment, and the median duration response exceeded 1.5 years. While the patient population is limited, it is an important advance for patients who previously had limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending extension of the current indication for Xalkori to also include treatment of adults with ROS-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission.","In vaccines, we have two preventative vaccines, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, in Phase 2 clinical development. We expect to have C. difficile Phase 2 data towards the end of this year.","In inflammation and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us crisaborole. It is an important potential first-line treatment option for the 18 million to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. who have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients, who have not seen new treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase 3 study were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and the new drug application is currently under review by the U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017.","For Xeljanz, we have recently announced positive top line results from the third Phase 3 trial of Xeljanz for patients with moderately to severe active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase 3 pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that Xeljanz has the potential to be an effective new treatment option that both induces and maintains remission in UC. We also announced results from two pivotal trials in Xeljanz for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The two psoriatic arthritis studies, along with a long-term extension study, are expected to form the potential submission package for possible future regulatory applications.","In pain, we've begun enrollment in all the Phase 3 tanezumab studies. This program consists of six studies and approximately 7,000 patients in three chronic pain conditions: three in osteoarthritis, two in chronic low back pain, and one in cancer pain. The study results are projected to being reporting out in 2018.","We also are strengthening our gene therapy capabilities. Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Bamboo, a privately held company biotech company based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition complements our growing rare disease portfolio with preclinical assets including potential therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Friedreich's ataxia.","In addition, we are making good progress in hematological, including a Phase 3 study in sickle cell disease. With our partner, Spark, we recently presented data to the World Federation of Hemophilia Congress and have received breakthrough designation for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase 1\/2 trial as a potential one-time treatment for hemophilia B.","Turning now to Pfizer's Essential Health. The business continues to move close to stabilizing its revenue base. Excluding the impact of Hospira, the legacy Essential Health business was nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of the year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to move to operational growth through a combination of expanded biosimilars (12:32) portfolios. Much of this is aided by the Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by 4% operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas where the business (12:48).","Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to (12:55). And expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilar launches in the U.S. And recently we announced our investment to develop a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center in Hangzhou Economic Development Area in China. This innovative facility will ensure we develop and manufacture the high-quality, affordable biosimilar medicines that have the potential to benefit patients both in China and throughout the world.","And to potentially further enhance the revenue growth of this business, we will continue to actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective for Pfizer Essential Health has not changed: to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the business is on a good trajectory, and we are taking the actions that will help enable us to achieve this goal.","Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we have previously said, we are assessing the merits of separation and expect to arrive at a decision no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make-or-break decision for the company. As I have just shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well, and we'll continue to pursue the strategies including opportunistic business development where appropriate to accelerate our strategy, and a strategy that will best position them for long-term success.","As a reminder, our decision criteria for a split of the business has not changed. We continue to be based on four questions: Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there trapped value in a combined entity? And can the trapped values be unlocked efficiently? We will be thoughtful in evaluating the virtues of split over the coming months. Our key and primary motivation here is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view there being a wrong answer here. The decision will be taken in the straightforward context of the best path forward for shareholder value.","In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that is positioning us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results of the quarter. Thank you.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3rd, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior-year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations.","Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%.","In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion or 17% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues in Prevnar 13 Adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter, product losses of exclusivity, and the expiration of a collaboration agreement co-promote Rebif in the U.S.","In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and certain Essential Health products, primarily in China, which were partially offset by lower revenues of Prevnar 13 due to the timing of purchases from Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets.","Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.33 compared with $0.42 in the year-ago quarter due to higher asset impairment charges, product losses of exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters, and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues from certain new, in-line, and acquired products, as well as a lower effective tax rate.","Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due to our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses of $913 million or 13%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange, and continuing product losses of exclusivity.","I want to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward.","Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations; new products that are early in their life cycles, such as Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz; as well as the solid performance for Lyrica. We reaffirmed 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholders returns in 2016 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian and Frank, for the review. And, operator, if you can please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Oh, hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Ian, I hope you're well. Frank, hope you're well.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Ian, on the topic of the split, I think at Tim's conference a month or so you made some remarks that the Street interpreted as you backing away from a split. And that's sort of the widely held consensus view now. So I'd just like to hear you explain what did you actually mean to communicate at that particular broker conference? And then, if I may, maybe be for Dolsten, could we get an update on the oral PCSK9 and timelines for the injectable CVOT trials and whether there's any possibility you'd file before they're out? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mark. First of all, I want to stress that no decision has been made, and ultimately our decision will be based on what we believe is the best interests of the shareholders. And going back to my prepared remarks, we are looking at these four criteria of, are the businesses performing well? Do we believe the businesses could continue to perform well? Do we believe there's trapped value? And can we extract it on an after-tax basis?","So I don't know what the Street perceived I signaled or didn't signal in that meeting. I indicated I do believe that the trapped value question has become more complicated, with both the increase in our share value and the decrease in the P\/Es of the comparables. We continue to have very robust dialogue in the company, preparing for this decision. Certainly, stress-testing with our two management teams on issues of what initiatives inside their strategies could only be done if they were separate? And this is, I think, a key point to look at. Is there some material obstacle inside the company for implementation of strategies of either of these divisions if they remain inside Pfizer, or can all material strategies be efficiently implemented if we were part of Pfizer?","So no decision has been taken, and will make that call by the end of the year. And I look forward to giving a decision on that. What I would like to stress is that I don't think that optionality necessarily has an expiration date. Like any business we have in Pfizer, whether it's any part of our business, we continually look at our capital allocation. We continue to look at what's in the best interests of Pfizer. Which businesses prosper best in Pfizer? And so what I would say on optionality is that we will have set up the infrastructure and to be able to look at this question at any point in the future if the decision was at the end of the year to remain as we are with both divisions inside Pfizer. If we could go to oral PCSK9.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Oral PCSK9. Yeah, we don't think that the oral PCSK9 profile would be competitive with the (24:30) with PCSK9 antibodies observed in many Phase 3 trials. In the (24:38) area, we actually have moved other interesting products forward, and we have two NMEs coming into the exciting field of NASH. Albert, do you want to share a comment on the regulatory strategy for \u2013 ?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And the progress of our program with the injectable, yes. We recently confirmed that both studies met their primary endpoints. The remaining two ongoing SPIRE lipid-lowering studies are anticipated to complete later in 2016. Patient enrollment in the SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcome was completed in April of 2016. And based on our current estimate, the primarily completion of the SPIRE-2 study is expected to occur in the second half of 2017.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Ian, would you say it's fair to say that maximizing your tax structure and access to balance sheet, things you care deeply about, are things that cannot be addressed anytime soon without a separation of some kind? And then a second question, if I could ask for your latest intentions on launching Inflectra. And are there any key legal milestones that we should be aware of here in the coming months? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. You know, a separation doesn't, under the current tax laws, facilitate a speedy ability to change the domicile for either of the companies. Under the separation rules now, both companies would be held to the standard of the combined company for three years post the separation. So under present tax laws, I don't see a separation as being a quick route to improving the tax situation. However, I am and remain optimistic that this tax issue will be dealt with by Washington, hopefully in the near future. And I think there is a general consensus that we do need to have tax reform to enable U.S. multinationals to be competitive.","On the launch of infliximab, I'll ask John to answer that.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Gregg. So in terms of just one initial comment commercially, I would just reconfirm that we're moving ahead with launch preparations, and launch timing will be impacted by the upcoming court decision. I'll ask Doug Lankler, our General Counsel, to make a couple of comments there.","Douglas M. Lankler - Pfizer Inc.","Just to review the dates. So Inflectra was improved on April 5, and we give our notice to Janssen immediately. That notice period expires on October 2, and we've agreed not to launch before October 3. Earlier this year we filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for Janssen's 471 antibody patent (27:40). Starting on August 16, the federal court in Massachusetts will hear arguments on this motion and some other issues. If the court rules in our favor, there would be no legal restriction on our ability to launch. If the court doesn't rule in our favor, we still have the trial, and we'll review our options at that time.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, so if I could confirm. If the court were to rule in our favor, we expect that we would launch Inflectra sometime after October 2, which is after the expiry of the 180-day notice period.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And if they don't rule in our favor, we would need to look at the different scenarios of when we launch, what's the value of launching on our own? What's the risk we're taking, taking that launch risk? What is the loss of value if other competitors come in with us? And we'll make that decision once we know the results of the court case.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Frank would like to add some -","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Yeah, just \u2013 Gregg, real quick, to punctuate what Ian said relative to the tax rate, just \u2013 it's the third set of proposed regs that Treasury issued in April, where basically, the split companies, if you were to split, each of the split companies would be valued at the pre-split Pfizer valuation for a three-year period. That's just a little bit more detail.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. I guess first a question for John on essential medicines. I guess we're roughly a year post-Hospira. Could you just maybe elaborate a little bit on the key growth drivers for your franchise going forward and how you think about a longer-term sustainable growth rate for this business as we move past the remaining LOEs?","And a second question coming back to the question of split. I think we've seen past pharma spin-offs do very well and uncover additional strategies to drive shareholder value that may not have been considered when they were part of a larger organization. I guess \u2013 I mean, look at Zoetis, for example; I think that surprised the Street on how much margin leverage they've had. Is that a relevant thing to think about with these much larger businesses you're considering to be splitting here? And how does that factor into a decision to split the company? Thanks so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll ask John to do the post-Hospira; then I'll talk about the split and also ask Frank to add some comments too.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question, Chris. So, yeah, first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in second quarter and so far this year across all of the segments of our business, both legacy portfolio, the peri-LOE brands, which are performing above market benchmarks, the emerging market business, and then the growth drivers, biosimilars and our sterile injectable portfolio. So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer's the leader in total sales with biosimilars commercialized across all three classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market.","Sterile injectables is another attractive segment, and clearly that was a primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well, and we continue to be very positive about the opportunities for continued growth in the sterile injectable business.","And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the \u2013 incorporation of Hospira operations. But actually even excluding the impact of Hospira, we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see the anti-infectives portfolio and women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us where we have a leadership position.","So when we put all those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low to mid-single digit range. And, as a consequence, we believe we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. I would add that part of the investment case with Hospira was the launch of some of their portfolio in the international markets. This does not occur immediately. It depends upon the state of their different registrations. And, frankly, we expect that to occur over a two-year period post the integration. So some of that growth internationally will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways to restructure in that. So that's part of the strategy of the team.","With regard to the split, yeah. It's a good question when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what was perceived as increase in value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at perhaps the \u2013 you said our own Animal Health split or Abbott or Baxter or the others. You have to question, number one, were the separate parts all being invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention? I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments heavily, and there's a big difference between a division that you're spinning being 8% of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 45% of your total revenues.","So I think those are things we're looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that split companies will improve their performance because there's more management focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships, and also we've looked some of that resource. Perhaps, Frank, we'll have you comment on that.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sure. So we looked at the S&P 500 index and we compared it to the Guggenheim split company index. And it's interesting. If you look for one year, the S&P outperforms the split company index. Five years, it's about a push, roughly a push. 10 years, the split company index outperforms the S&P 500, but on a compounded growth rate basis 1% and change. So there's no real material difference. At least if you look at the returns on a one-side and 10-year period, the S&P versus the index.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so the key question I think (34:20) questions, is what can be done differently if the divisions are split versus what can be done if they're inside Pfizer? Part of which brings in of course balance sheet, brings in the whole capital structures and also appetite for risk. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Good morning, everyone. So my first one I guess would be for Albert and just around Prevnar. You did obviously give the guidance for this year and how to think about the impact of the catch-up dosing last year. Can you just talk a little bit more longer term? So how do you see this franchise as you think about 2017, 2018, both U.S. ex U.S.? And then also if you could just remind us on \u2013 it's been a couple years now since the ACIP recommendation for use in adults. What's the timing and the process for them to sort of reassess that? I think it was five years after that initial vote, but if you can just remind us.","And then my second one I think is for John, just on the EH business. You talked about the top line. Maybe if you could give a little bit more just understanding, I was surprised by the margins that we saw this quarter. They were quite a bit below last quarter. Is there something specific to this quarter? Or how should we think about the operating margin progression for this business going forward? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. I'm going to let Albert answer the questions you asked. And I think on the margins, Frank has some interesting analysis that he'll comment on. Albert.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Speaking of the remaining of this year. Overall we expect total for revenue franchise to be comparable or slightly down compared to 2015, as Ian said. Moving forward, in the U.S. we are focused on capturing the remaining cohort and expanding uses to a greater age range, given the expanded label. However, to realize the full potential of this, we need the ACIP recommendation. We will also continue developing fully in the other markets. As we always do, we will incorporate our expectations into our 2017 guidance that we will provide in January.","But just to make some comments. Prevnar will continue to be a significant problem. Generally speaking, in the U.S., we will continue to see a decline as we exhaust the catch-up opportunity, and then we will stabilize. In international markets, we'll continue growing as we gain more reimbursement and recommendations. And of course we are working to develop a next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with additional serotypes.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","And then on the Essential Health business and the margins, from a gross margin perspective it's really a combination of the impact of Hospira, which has lower gross margins relative to the overall business, and then the impact of product LOEs. Those are the two things really driving the gross margin impact. If you go down to operating margin, then once again, it's really a combination of the incremental Hospira SI&A spend and the incremental Hospira R&D spend, which weren't in the prior-year numbers. Those two on expenses, give or take, about $170 million combined. You drop all that, and that's also what impacting the operating margin.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","But we're not seeing anything that is outside of our expectations other than in this timing in the second quarter of the exchange whammy, which is in the cost of goods due to phasing and in the revenue, and our full-year forecasts take that into account.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Yeah, in fact, we gave guidance for the year. We reaffirmed our cost of sale guidance, 21% to 22%, which takes all of that \u2013 Essential Health, Innovative Health, all the FX \u2013 we take all that into account.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian and Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, thank you. A couple of questions. Ian, when you and I spoke about a split-up in early June, one of the metrics you said you were considering was how cash flows would be impacted as a split company versus a combined company. And you brought that up a couple times, almost seeming to signal that there was a cash flow problem of some sort if you were to split. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what potential problems might be from a cash flow perspective and balance sheet perspective?","And second question, also in early June, when we talked about M&A, you mentioned all options were on the table when talking about deal sizes. And I'm wondering how much weight to give language like that. Does it really mean it's reasonably possible that we could see Pfizer spend, let's say, $100 billion on an acquisition target? And maybe this is a dumb question, but with your I-O platform you're building, are you willing to rule out some of the obvious big I-O take-out targets like a Bristol or an Astra that would obviously be duplicative in certain ways?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. I don't think there's \u2013 what I indicated to you was that we're looking at the capital structures of the two businesses and how you deploy the cash flows. And clearly if you're in two distinct divisions, you don't have the same opportunities of deployment of cash, if you're in two companies as you do if you're one. You have less choices as to in which areas you put it. When you're one company, you can take those cash flows, return them to shareholders, continue to invest in the area of business, pay your dividend, or do business development in the essential business. Once you split, you've permanently divided those cash flows and of course you lose flexibility. I think that was basically my comment there, which is understandable.","Your question on M&A is \u2013 we constantly survey the M&A space. We have the ability to do acquisitions. I don't think we're necessarily limited in size. If the transaction is attractive and creates shareholder value, we have the wherewithal to do the transactions we need to do. And I really wouldn't speculate and never have speculated on specific targets or specific opportunities. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two questions. The first is a more near-term question on Prevnar. I believe the last update on the U.S. adult penetration was that about one-third of the market had been penetrated, and today it was stated to be 40%. So it appears that there has been some additional penetration, but sales are still down versus Q1 and down versus Q4. So the question is why are sales declining when penetration still appears to be on the uptick?","And the second question is for Dr. Dolsten. Pfizer had some provocative early data on a differentiated gamma-secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease at the recent AAIC meeting. Is Pfizer moving ahead with this agent despite multiple failures from other companies in gamma-secretase? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Could you, Albert, explain the dynamics of the adult market in the U.S.?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Steve, the reason why this is happening is because this is a one-time event in the lifetime of the individual adult. So individuals are vaccinated, they don't have an opportunity to repeat the vaccination in the next year, and that counts against you when you move into the next year.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So the increased penetration just indicates you've now got less of a pool to get 100% of the pool vaccinated. We now think 40% have been vaccinated. There's a remaining 60%, but those 60% are harder to get at because most of them haven't been vaccinated by (42:42) and so they're more difficult targets to access.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","All that were vaccinated last year, they don't repeat the vaccination this year.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","No.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","So the growth is declining.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Declining. Okay, Mikael. Gamma-secretase.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank for interest and great that you picked up some of the things we have communicated. We have been quite nice the full year in the Alzheimer's space with a gamma-secretase modulator and a very selective BACE-1 inhibitor. Our gamma-secretase modulator was based on extensive work to develop a unique profile in the sense that it modulates rather than inhibits the cleavage of the gamma-secretase function of the a betas. So you get a unique profile where you do lower some of the forms of amyloid \u2013 the longer forms, typically the 1-40 amyloid beta. That has been assumed to be the most toxic, while it actually preserves and possibly enhance some of the shorter forms that potentially even can be beneficial.","So we do think we have a unique profile, and it does not have the type of so far side effects that have been reported with gamma secretase inhibitor, including GI issues. This has been a very tolerable, clean ride. So we will certainly continue to look at ways to advance this molecule, and a standalone molecule, and we have the unique opportunity to consider combining it with BACE-1. So as a team we feel very enthusiastic about the recent advances, and thank you again for having noticed it.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Ian, not to belabor this topic, but forgive me \u2013 I am, just for a couple more questions. If the decision is not to split later this year, should shareholders infer that you believe that Pfizer shares are fully valued? Because you spend a lot of time talking about \u2013 part of the decision is to decide whether or not there's trapped value. So if you decide not, I would assume that would mean that you feel that there is no trapped value.","My second question is I think investors are also just frustrated that it's taking so long to decide. Is this all about tax considerations? Because it seems that when you initially floated the idea and created three separate companies, which is now two separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan. So I'm just wondering how important having a competitive tax basis is to making your decision a tax inversion?","And, third, you brought this up in your comments, but just curious \u2013 your level of optimism that a new administration will pass broad tax reform. And should that happen, does it make sense for you to wait on deciding on a major transaction or deciding on a split? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Well, I would leave the market to decide if Pfizer's shares are fully valued, and while I personally think that we have a lot of very positive energy in our pipeline and our stock, and whether it's fully valued or not doesn't mean there is or is not trapped value in one segment of it. So I think they are different questions. So the answer would be, I'm not sure there's trapped value, but I'm pretty sure that we have a very robust pipeline and we'll produce greater value for shareholders as we go forward. And so I think that's the way to answer that.","Now, on the tax reform. I am cautiously optimistic as there is more discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, the need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully that with a new administration, whoever the administration is in, they will relook at the need and there will be energy around tax reform. And of course, the potential of that tax reform has implications for what type of transactions you want to do and what type of premiums you want to pay. So it is an influence in our thinking.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks. I've got two questions. Firstly, could you give us an estimate of Ibrance penetration broken down, if possible, by line of therapy in the U.S.? And then on Sutent, I've been modeling pressure going forward as I-O therapies into earlier lines of setting. But is there an opportunity to protect value by moving it into the adjuvant space? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Richard. Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much, Richard. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. As Ian said, this launch has been prescribed by more than 7,600 physicians, and received by approximately 35,000 metastatic breast cancer patients. On your question on the penetration in the different lines. The most recent markets served reports I have seen (48:17), the first-line markets of 43%, and the second and third line markets served of 46% and 24%, respectively.","And also we continue to see very strong insurance. Feedback from prescribers and patients continue to be very positive, particularly on patient quality of life. And moving forward we will continue building momentum in the U.S. as we expand on our penetration in all lines of therapy. We will continue to expand geographically. As you know, we have filed in EU and could have an improved product by the end of the year, and we will continue to expand into earlier lines of therapy. As you know, we have three different studies ongoing in this population.","Now let me move to Sutent. You're right. We did report the S-TRAC results. Let me just say a few words about it. Today there are not treatments approved or widely used in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Nephrectomy is the standard of care. The S-TRAC study that we did aimed to determine if adjuvant therapy with Sutent post-nephrectomy would be beneficial for RCC patients with non-metastatic disease, and we did work in high-risk of patient (49:35). The results were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful. So if approved, Sutent would be the first product approved in the adjuvant setting for RCC.","Too early to comment on filing and approval timelines. We will update you on appropriate times, but how to think about the opportunity was basically \u2013 was also part of your question. The eligible population for S-TRAC was stage 3 patients and a small part of nonmetastatic stage 4. The stage 3 population in the U.S. is 5,000 to 6,000 per year, approximately. Assuming that 80% of patients that are stage 3, are receiving nephrectomy, these will result in approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients eligible for Sutent in the U.S. per year, with similar numbers expected in Europe. Of course these are preliminary numbers, and in case of potential approval also will depend on the label.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have a few on Xeljanz. When you look, growth has picked up of late, and you do have ulcerative colitis and PsA as new drivers. But on the other side you have JAKs hitting the market soon and competitively, and uncertainty on psoriasis. So I think my question here is, where does this sit among Pfizer's priorities for commercial-stage products? And then do you have to press reset in the positioning here when you look at the marketplace, especially with baricitinib coming? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Geoff \u2013 Albert, do you want to take this question, please?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, absolutely. Look, we are very bullish on the opportunity with Xeljanz. The growth was significant, 72%, and we continue to expand the results for Xeljanz geographically, as you're aware. In March the EMA accepted our application for the treatment of RA. Discussions are going well, and also we are looking forward to new indications in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Both of them are sizable markets. (52:00) each one of them of market opportunity.","In your question about competition, first of all, it's difficult to make direct comparisons without head-to-head trials. The results from the initial Phase 3 studies of competitors, of baricitinib, for example, appear to be consistent with the JAK class. But we believe that these data continue to support the value of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of RA, and as a result will grow the class. For our product we are confident in the value of Xeljanz because we are the first in class JAK inhibitor, and the ongoing data dissemination of extensive real-world experience continues and will provide significant growth.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Morning. A few things. First, can you give us a little more color on China and the growth there, and what are the key products and what's happening? Second, Lyrica, both first quarter and second quarter there's been a significant jump in revenues, and yet you look at the prescription trends and they haven't changed much, so it's clearly pricing. And I'm just curious if there's more of the pricing that's reaching the ASP versus \u2013 and gross to nets are changing there in a good way for you? And then, third, can you just let us know for the rest of the year what kind of data readouts will we see for your immuno-oncology assets? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. John, China, please","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question, Marc. So China continues to perform well, even in the face of some anticipated cost pressures. We continue to see some strong volume growth overall. Our business grew around about 11% in the quarter. Hospira was a very small driver that growth, and to Ian's earlier comments, in China whilst we see significant potential from the Hospira portfolio, it will take time to realize that just given by the time of regulatory approval.","Overall the franchises that are growing strongly in China include our cardiovascular business, which is really very well aligned to the increasing priorities of the Chinese government. Our anti-infective portfolio continues to perform well, and overall we're really very positive about the opportunities for our business in China. It's very well-aligned with priorities of the Chinese government, and we're working very closely with them to strengthen primary care services and management for chronic diseases, which we believe will do good things for the Chinese healthcare system and for patients, and obviously are very well-aligned with our portfolio as well.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. Albert, Lyrica.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Oh, Lyrica is doing very well. In the U.S., it was a significant growth, but also outside U.S., which had the growth this quarter. And it is a mixture. It's a mix of both volume \u2013 volume is growing \u2013 and pricing. And internationally it's mainly volume.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","I think the pricing in the U.S. reflects the value of the product to the patients and to the healthcare system. Data on immuno-oncology.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, I'll say a few words on data readouts in oncology overall. We have readouts for non-small lung cancer, (55:16) patients with dacomitinib. We have a readout \u2013 that's a Phase 3 study. We have a readout also for Bosulif in first-line female. Again a Phase 3 study. And in the early pipeline we'll continue to update you as the data evolve on our I-O portfolio. (55:40) that was shared at ASCO for (55:42) avelumab. (55:43) avelumab likely to come at select conferences late this year and early next year.","I should also mention that in our portfolio of targeted cancer drugs, we will share at the later quarter this year encouraging data with several compounds: glasdegib, also known earlier as SMO, in AML; PTK7 ADC ovarian cancer; lorlatinib for ALK-positive lung cancer; and our 7775 ED4 mutant drug for resistant lung cancer will also be shared. So it's quite a nice, rich data flow in both I-O and targeted cancer drugs over the period to come.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Ian, obviously 4% operational revenue growth for a company of your size is good. But as you step back and look at your Innovative segment, it is quite concentrated on Prevnar, the trajectory of which is uncertain, as illustrated this quarter. And it's also quite dependent on Ibrance and Xeljanz for growth, both of which have significant competition coming. And finally you've got these patent expressions between 2020 and 2023. So how do you think about the growth prospects of the Innovative segment, since that's clearly where you get most of your valuation? And could you comment on the need for business development there?","And a couple quick follow-ups if I may. Sorry if I missed this, but what was Prevnar adult sales by region, if possible? And how should we think about Chantix's new growth trajectory? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Alex. Look, on the Innovative business, I think it's in a very strong position right now. If you look at the underlying growth of Ibrance and Xeljanz and Chantix and Lyrica, clearly the business is functioning both well internationally and in the U.S., so I think there are strong short-term drivers. I do understand, as we've signaled to you, that Prevnar is likely not to be a growth contributor in 2017 and 2018. But on the other hand while we'll see a reduction in adult sales in the U.S., we'll begin to see a pickup of adult sales internationally, and we'll look to explore adult sales in the audience from 18 to 55 in the U.S. as well. So I think you'll see very strong growth drivers in most of our major products in the Innovative area with slower growth or flattish probably in Prevnar.","And then I think you look to the \u2013 while we do have LOEs later on in the decade, we then begin to see the result of all of our investment in innovation. We began to see the launch of tanezumab. We see the launch of PCSK9, or you see the launch of ertugliflozin, which we believe is a best-in-class molecule and coming into a revitalized positioning in the marketplace. We see our vaccine products coming forward, with C. difficile or perhaps later Staph aureus.","So I think we see our whole I-O portfolio coming through very strongly, and there I too believe that while table stakes is the PD-1, what is really going to differentiate the companies is the ability to play in spaces from, what we would call, cold tumors, which don't react to the PD-L1s. And you then need to get in there with biospecifics or vaccines where we're very strong, or where you need to go beyond the PD-L1 and you need to add triplets and doublets.","We have nine products in immuno-oncology. So I think we're going to be positioned as a company that can give you the backbone of the PD-L1 and, in the same package, can give you doublets and triplets and traditional therapy. And I believe this is the key to really unlocking the value of immuno-oncology, is this offerings of capturing patients rather than capturing individual treatment arms. So I'm excited about both our near-term and long-term opportunities. Thank you.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","The revenues for adults and the question on Chantix, maybe I can take. The adult revenues this quarter were $320 million, and by region that was $276 million in the U.S., but as we said declined 37%, and $45 million internationally, but increased 41%, and that trend will continue and will increase.","On Chantix, Chantix revenues were up 24% operationally, and that was driven by the U.S. (1:00:53) compared to other. And the evolving safety profile, based upon the EAGLES and real-world data. Apparently, EAGLES data is very important. Right? So let me give you some insight on that.","The trial was the largest clinical trial of approved smoking cessation medicine. It was conducted at the request of the FDA and the EMA. The trial concluded, but the trial did not show a significant increase in the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or with bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine. And in terms of efficacy, results showed that patients taking Chantix had significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than patients taking bupropion.","In Europe, the Champix label has already been updated to remove the black triangle. And in the U.S., as you may be aware, the FDA has scheduled a joint advisory committee meeting that will review those data. Overall we believe that the available clinical data does not support an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric safety events in patients attempting to quit smoking with Chantix. And obviously a black box warning is discouraging for physicians prescribe the product and for patients to take this medicine. So we are really looking forward to discussing in September with the advisory committee.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to go back and revisit the taxation question, Ian. If we look at your current tax rate of 24%, our thoughts are that if you look at some of your losses of exclusivity, and if you've done really good tax planning on a lot of your assets that lose exclusivity between now and 2020, we estimate that there's approximately about $12 billion that lose exclusivity during that time period. And when you couple that with Prevnar that is above your tax rate \u2013 at least that's our assumption \u2013 isn't there an issue where we could see some creep upward on your overall effective tax rate? And just help us understand \u2013 I know you don't give a long-term projection, but again with that thinking, it would seem that with those sales accounting for about one-third of your total sales, that that might influence the tax rate or bias it upwards.","Second question, since you haven't taken off the table a large acquisition, can you remind us the qualities of the AZN acquisition that you attempted? And is that something that you might consider revisiting going forward?","And then the last question just has to do with Anacor. On the crisaborole asset, you've given a long-term revenue target for that asset. Are you still comfortable with that target? And by what year could you hit that target? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on crisaborole, I think we're very confident of the \u2013 assuming approval \u2013 of our forecast we put out there. We think it's a unique product. Clearly, you need a ramp-up of \u2013 normally you hit peak sales in about fifth year out. Maybe it's faster with this product given the unmet medical need. But I don't think we've given evidence on that or given information out on that. Albert, do you have any update on that?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","No, you said it very well. We do believe what we said, but we continue, after seeing the product, that would be a $2 billion-plus opportunity and is driven by, really, the unmet medical need. Today patients suffering from this condition have limited treatment options, because approved therapies have limitations related to safety, including black box warnings. And crisaborole's known mechanism of action, already used systemically in other agents, has the potential to have a very favorable safety profile, which is particularly important in pediatric populations, which is a very big part of the overall atopic dermatitis population.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So we're confident of our preliminary projections, and we expect earlier than the normal fifth-year peak sales, given the unmet medical need in the marketplace. You know, the attraction of AZ was threefold. It was around revenue and pipeline, especially their immune-oncology assets, which are now not as relevant to us given our deal with Merck.","It was around operational expense savings, and it was around financial or ability to deploy our capital globally in a tax-efficient manner. You know, I really can't comment on any appetite around any specific company. So we remain interested in doing business development deals that would achieve some similar results, i.e., getting pipeline that's got growth that fills in our pipeline, operational synergy savings and potentially tax savings. Those still remain attractive to us.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And Frank on the tax rate.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Yeah, so, John, the way to think about this is in 2009 our tax rate was 30%. We've given guidance this year with a tax rate at 24%. We've actually taken that tax rate down give or take about 1% a year since 2009. I think we've clearly established a really good rhythm \u2013 and by the way we did that during a period of very large LOEs. Now obviously, going forward we'll provide guidance on the 2017 tax rate on our fourth quarter earnings call when we close out 2016 and give guidance for 2017. But please know, obviously we do lots of tax planning. We understand what's coming at us for the next few years, and our objective is continue to have that tax rate be as effective and as efficient as possible.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Manoj Garg from Healthco.","Manoj K. Garg - ABR-Healthco","Great. Thank you. I have two commercial questions and one capital allocation question for Frank. On the commercial front for Xeljanz \u2013 we noticed that it came off of Express Scripts' excluded list for 2017. Can you comment on any other notable changes for 2017? On Ibrance, are you proactively taking any measures there with contracting to ensure a leadership position when additional competitors \u2013 or if and when they do emerge? And then I'll follow up with my question for Frank.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On the commercial situation, we continue to improve our access and our tiering on Xeljanz and on Ibrance. We think we're in a very strong position. We offer very good value equation to patients in managed care, and we'll continue to monitor that as and when competition comes through. And your question on the -","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Xeljanz?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","No. On the capital allocation? Yeah, can you repeat the last question you had?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","I think was on Ibrance, yes.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","We're okay on that. Let's just go to the third question you wanted to propose to Frank? No? I'll come back.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sorry, we'll get you off-line.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","We'll get him off-line. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks very much. I have one question for Frank and one for John. Frank, could you just talk about the stand-up costs preparing for separation that have been reflected in recent non-GAAP operating profit results? So, more specifically, I don't know if you have the numbers, but possibly the first half spending that was in your non-GAAP income statement in the first half of 2016.","And then for John, with respect to your internal Pfizer-developed Remicade biosimilar program, could you please just update us on that and your plans for that going forward?","And actually before I finish, going back to Frank, should we assume that whatever the stand-up costs or potential separation costs that are being run through the income statement this year will continue going forward? Since Ian had mentioned that even if you decide not to split at the end of this year, you plan to retain that optionality. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Frank.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","So on the optionality costs, Dave, those costs are all in GAAP results. They're not in adjusted results, so what you've referred to as non-GAAP. Let me run the numbers. For this quarter, it was about $60 million; year to date, it's about $110 million. Since inception of the projects \u2013 and that goes back a couple years \u2013 $600 million. And one key point here is, the way we program the work and therefore the resulting spending is approximately two-thirds of the spend would take place after we make a decision. So we've programmed it to try to preserve as much capital as we can while giving ourselves the ability to implement optionality if we decided to do so, within that 12-month period following the decision. And in terms of the sunk costs, that would obviously \u2013 that work is completed. And if we were to make a decision soon or sometime in the future, that work remains completed. We don't basically lose any of the work that we've completed to date.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and ongoing costs to maintain the reporting we have are not -","Douglas M. Lankler - Pfizer Inc.","De minimis.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","De minimis.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","De minimis.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, David, for the question on our internal infliximab program. So just as a reminder, we outlicensed that as part of our agreement with the EMA when we acquired Hospira to Novartis\/Sandoz. We retained the commercial rights for a number of territories, including the U.S. and certain other markets. That program is progressing on track. We expect to have the readout from our pivotal Phase 3 trials from that program towards the end of this year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. As we think about the Anacor acquisitions, you guys made an unusual move and seemingly a timely one given the increase in valuations in the biotech market. Ian, can you just kind of comment that on the valuations in the biotech space as you see them today? Do you see opportunities despite the increased valuation? Or do you think that enthusiasm here is starting to build in too high expectations?","And as a follow-up to that, can you guys comment a little bit on the strategy with crisaborole? Obviously, it fits well with your pediatric sales force, but this is also an entry into the dermatology market to some degree, where you certainly are present with Enbrel internationally but don't really have a presence in the dermatology market in the U.S. Just wondering if there's a broader interest in the derm space, particularly medical derm, where when we hear from dermatologists, there is a significant vacuum in innovation.","And then the second question, just biosimilars in general. We heard from Sandoz in June that pricing is coming in quite a bit below where they had modeled the market, but penetration is also coming in higher. Can you guys talk a little bit about \u2013 John, maybe you can talk a little bit about how the biosimilar market is evolving and how the uptake of Inflectra might be different from competition that you might see to Enbrel or how you might compete for pharmacy-delivered injectable products. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Hey, Seamus. On the valuations, I think that if you go back six or seven months, they were \u2013 I think we said that we thought they were frothy on biotech. They came down and are beginning to build back up again. It all depends on each individual company. What's the product? What's the opportunity? What are you willing to pay? What can you add to it? I don't know if you can generalize on valuations across different products. But thank you for the question.","On the crisaborole?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. First of all, you're absolutely right that derm is a very important area for immunology, we have rheumatology, dermatology, and GI, and derm was what we were missing, and now we're getting with crisaborole. We are building derm capability as we speak, (1:14:35) capabilities. Anacor had already started building them and to continue very rapidly scaling them up, and we are going to use our own primary care footprint because a big part of crisaborole sales will be primary care, and of course our pediatric footprint.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John. Thank you, Albert.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Seamus. So exactly as you say, we believe that there's likely to be some significant variability molecule to molecule and product to product, and indeed across markets based on a variety of factors, primarily including the number of entrants, the quality and breadth of the label, as well as the individual reaction to biosimilar competition. That's pretty much what we are seeing in Europe. We've always said that we would expect price discounting to be somewhere in the 30% to 50% range. That pretty much is what we're seeing across Europe overall with some variability across molecules, and we expect similar range in the U.S. So overall, again, the market is very much behaving in line with our expectations, and we've been very positive with the rate of adoption of Inflectra that we've seen in Europe and are certainly very positive about the potential opportunity that this represents in the United States, too.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, John. Operator, can we take our last question, please?","Operator","Your final question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Two questions. First on the biosimilars and the new facility, when do you think that would be operational? And are there any trends that you're seeing in the marketplace that give you additional confidence in building this facility? And the other is on the overall pricing environment. A couple of your peers have mentioned that the pricing environment in the U.S. has more recently been difficult, and they're assuming increased price pressure in the U.S., including increased rebating and discounting. Are you seeing that? And how do you look at that going in the next year or so? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","I'll do the pricing, and then ask John to answer on the biosimilar in China. I think pricing has been competitive and difficult for many years now. Managed care is organized, the market is competitive, the product has to have value add to get access. I think Ibrance is an example of a product that has got access. I don't perceive that in our therapies with the products we have that the pricing has become more difficult in the last year than previously.","Is there political rhetoric that you would expect around the political season on pricing? Absolutely. Have there been some bad actors which have made it more difficult for the industry to get its message across? There have been. But I still believe that this society and the opinion leaders believe in an innovative industry and understand that a high-risk industry needs to have an ability to recuperate its capital and attracting capital, and so I think that overall we'll continue in a competitive pricing environment, which is appropriate for society. So with that I'll ask John to talk about biosimilars.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","So thanks for the question, David. So let me just make comment first of all about the penetration of biologic medicines generally into China, which is low vis-\u00e0-vis most benchmarks internationally. And so we believe that post the expiry of any relevant patents in China, a biosimilar is a significant opportunity. Obviously we are committed to bringing high-quality products to market, and so we're very excited with the investment that we announced in Hangzhou Economic Development Area to invest $350 million in what will be a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center. That center is expected to be completed in 2018, and we'll be working with the CFD and relevant Chinese authorities to bring products, biosimilar molecules coming out of that facility, to the Chinese market as soon as possible following the completion of the plant.","Charles E.

With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? ","Ian Read","Thank you, Chuck and good morning everyone. We finished 2014 with another quarter of good performance, and met or exceeded every element of our financial guidance for the year. Frank will take you through the numbers, but before he does I want to reemphasize how our four key imperatives have guided the actions we\u2019ve taken, and the decisions we\u2019ve made and will continue to guide us going forward. These imperatives are about the steps we're taking to create a sustainable, high-value pipeline; effectively and in a disciplined way deploy our capital and ways to create shareholder value; create a culture where colleagues take appropriate risks and accept accountability for their actions and own the respect of society. ","My remarks today will primarily focus on two of these imperatives; the evolution of our pipeline; and how we're creating shareholder value. When we started this journey at the start of 2011, we said improving the performance of our innovative core will be a multi-year endeavor. Over this time we\u2019ve significantly changed the composition of our pipeline to have a clearer focus on the therapeutic areas that have strong commercial and scientific potential. We\u2019ve improved progress in the pipeline. Since undertaking this effort, we\u2019ve received 16 approvals as of the end of last year, 10 of which were new molecular entities. ","Today we\u2019ve a total of 86 programs in clinical development with 29 programs in late-stage development or registration. We continue to grow in key areas most notably in some of our recently launched new products. Eliquis is winning share amongst cardiologists and moving towards the leading position in the new-to-brand share and several markets including the US and Japan. We grew our Xeljanz market share so that it is now ranks number three in new-to-brand prescription share with rheumatologists and we are seeing good uptake of our Prevnar 13 Adult vaccines following the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on immunization practices recommendation. ","This is good progress and over the course of the next four years we expect to have more than 20 Phase 2 and Phase 3 registration starts and hope to have more than 15 potential approvals, many of them new molecular entities. These numbers do not include study starts and approvals as a result of our Merck KGaA partnership in immuno-oncology. Many of the new molecular entities have the potential to be first-in-class assets that give us growth platforms. These include the CDK 4\/6 platform in oncology with [Ibrance] or the generic name palbociclib. And its potential for indication is being studied in the broad spectrum of breast cancer as well as lung, prostate, head and neck, melanoma, ovarian, renal and brain tumors in young children. ","We expect to have a competitive immuno-oncology program. We believe we\u2019ve a comprehensive program with all the elements to be an industry leader. Through our partnership with Merck KGaA and their anti-PD-L1 Avelumab, we're able to accelerate our participation in the immuno-oncology space enabling both companies to participate in the first wave of potential single-agent monotherapy treatment regimens of several tumor types, some of which we expect to be first or second to market. Additionally through this partnership, we're positioned to be a potential leader in the next wave of I\/O combination therapies. ","We expect to be amongst the first three companies in certain cancer indications with monotherapy and a leader with combinations of PDL-1 Avelumab with targeted agents. For example Inlyta, Xalkori and second generation ALK; or dual I\/O combinations for example for 4-1BB,OX40, ADCs etcetera and in various cancer indications. This year we\u2019ll be collaborating on up to 20 studies with Merck KGaA with registrational intent on up to six of these studies. In addition through the collaboration, we expect to have five different I\/O drugs in the clinic this year and up to 10 by 2016. ","This strategy includes checkpoint inhibitor maps, small molecule immunomodulators, cancer vaccines, bifunctional anti-bodies, CAR-T cell-based therapy and anti-body drug conjugates. Our partner expects to present data from their PDL-1 study at ASCO in June. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the most comprehensive I\/O platforms in development in the pharma industry today. We also have leading research on [indiscernible] biology with potential new indications with Xeljanz in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with our old product. ","Atopic dermatitis with a topical formulation, new GA indications and Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease and [ankylosing] spondylitis. We\u2019ve what we believe is a differentiated approach within the PCSK9 area for hyperlipidemia. Our lead asset bococizumab has a differentiated clinical [indiscernible] design which includes high-risk patients and also assesses primary prevention for patients. In addition to this large module approach, we\u2019ve both a small molecule and a vaccine in development nearing first in human. We\u2019ve made progress with anezumab and plan to submit preclinical data to the FDA this quarter in a complete response to potentially lift the clinical hold on that program. ","In the rare disease area we're seeing good progress with enrolment in cardiomyopathy Phase 3 programs with Tafamidis, and are advancing towards Phase 3 with Rivipansel, pending our discussion with the FDA on the final optimization of the formulation. We\u2019ve just announced a collaboration with OPKO for a long-acting growth hormone product that we believe could also be first in class if we were to expend that market. We\u2019ve a broad biosimilars portfolio of complex monoclonals. Of the current pipeline of five assets, three are ongoing, we're enrolling Phase 3 trials and include potential biosimilars to Herceptin, Rituxan and Remicade. ","We\u2019ve completed the Phase I trial for Avastin and expect to initiate our Phase 3 study later this year. And we've an ongoing Phase I proof-of-concept for [indiscernible]. We believe, we can become one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent biosimilar companies. We\u2019ve also several potential acceleration opportunities in the pipeline and that includes a next-generation ALK ROS1 inhibitor that holds the potential to significantly extend the lives of the patients who no longer respond to Xalkori. We expect to start a pivotal study this year. ","As you know our Staph aureus vaccine is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials and was granted Fast Track Designation by U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2014. A Phase 2b study that could be registrational is scheduled to start around the middle of this year. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in a relatively short period of time in terms of the quality of the assets in our pipeline and the potential for delivering breakthrough products starting in late 2017 and 18. Turning next to how the prudent deployment of capital has yielded significant returns to our shareholders. ","Over the last four years, we\u2019ve maintained our operating margins and have taken approximately $5.5 billion out of our operating expenses. During a period where we lost significant revenue to LOEs and co-promote expiries from several high margin products like Lipitor Enbrel in Canada and US and the loss of Spiriva. This year and for the next couple of years ongoing expense reductions will result from continuous improvement efforts. However given that the largest opportunities have already been realized, the amount of potential reductions is more limited. Also there are certain areas where we\u2019ll continue to invest in such as R&D and new product launches. ","Further we have returned just over 64 billion to shareholders with share repurchases and dividends over the last four years. And we\u2019ve worked to -- as we have worked to transform Pfizer, business development has been an important enabler of our strategy. We\u2019ve entered into a series of partnerships and license agreements and made some acquisitions that bolstered our vaccines portfolio, enhanced our established products portfolio, strengthened our oncology pipeline, expanded our consumer portfolio, and fortified the set of actions we\u2019ve across our key therapeutic areas. ","Given the strength of our late and mid-stage pipeline, we\u2019ll evaluate business development opportunities biased towards deals with a potential for creating value in the near term. Beyond business development, here is what you can expect to see from us in terms of additional actions we plan to take in 2015 to create shareholder value. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the launch of new products. We're excited about the potential revenue and continued growth prospects primarily for Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 Adult, Trumenba, Inlyta, Xalkori and Nexium 24HR. We expect these products along with a few others Vyndaqel, [indiscernible] and vaccines acquired from Baxter including pipeline\u2019s pending approval will generate nearly $2 billion in incremental operational revenue growth this year compared to last. ","So while we expect product launch costs will increase approximately 25% year-over-year, we're seeing good leverage from the investment we are making in these products. In addition to new products, in new launch products the Innovative business will be focused on growing market share in inline brands like Lyrica, Enbrel outside the US, [indiscernible] in the US, Chantix and the Prevnar franchise. In our consumer business we are focused on growing its core brands Advil and Centrum. Growing Nexium OTC market share and continuing to pursue our Rx OTC switch opportunities. ","For our established business we\u2019ll build on our success in 2014 in providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost treatments in emerging markets. We expect to see operational revenue growth of mid to high-single digits in the emerging markets this year by focusing on opportunities in key growth markets which is China, Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey. In 2015, we will continue our efforts to reach the groundwork required to be in a position to operationalize a potential to the company, and we\u2019ve made good progress on this work. For 2015, we anticipate the efforts that will be required for this work will result from approximately 400 million of one-time cost on a pre-tax basis. ","Let me remind you at this point in time we\u2019ve not yet made a decision with the company. We\u2019ve said the final decision will depend upon how our businesses perform in their markets, having a high degree of confidence that the businesses will be successful as stand-alone entities. And how our shareholders value these businesses if the sum of the parts is greater and whole. And in 2015, we\u2019ll again be in a position to reduce our adjusted effective tax rate. We expect it will decrease from 26.5% in 14 to approximately 25% this year. We\u2019ll continue to manage our tax line as we do any of our expense line and look to be as efficient as possible. I would note that foreign exchange is one of those items that can either work for us or against us. ","Most importantly, it is not indicative of how the business is performing in a fundamental manner. As always all of our decisions will be rooted in how best to strike the right balance in terms of capital deployment, dividends, buybacks and business development. One of the reasons I'm confident that we can accomplish all of this is because we\u2019ve an employee body that is motivated and engaged in the successful execution of the initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken to drive results. Over the past four years, we\u2019ve created a culture engrained in a strong ownership environment. ","In summary, we'll build on a performance of the past four years to create sustainable, high-value pipeline; to have market-leading, strong commercial businesses; to manage our cost structure; and continue to be disciplined in how we deploy our capital. Collectively these elements of our strategy, it will allow us to generate results that continue to create value, shareholder value. And it will enable us to bring the patients innovative medicines that best meet their needs. Now I\u2019ll turn over to Frank for additional details in the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2015. Thank you. ","Frank D Amelio ","Thanks Ian, and good day everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webast. I want to remind everybody that as a result on the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the animal health business and the gain associated with its full disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31st 2013. ","Fourth quarter 2014 reported revenues of approximately $13.1 billion which reflects a slight operational increase of $9 million year-over-year. It was mainly driven by the strong performance of Lyrica, Prevnar and Eliquis in developed markets, and Xeljanz which grew primarily in the US. And 7% operational growth in emerging markets driven by Lipitor mainly in China as well as Prevnar and Enbrel which were offset mainly by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $249 million or 3%, the loss of exclusivity for Celebrex in the US, desperation of the co-promotion term, the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the US and Canada, determination of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets. ","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.54 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a $0.01 negative impact in the foreign exchange, a 4% aggregate operational increase of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses driven by an unfavorable change in product mix and increased R&D expenses due to incremental expenses for the ongoing Phase 3 program of bococizumab, of palbociclib, ertugliflozin and certain other new drug candidates as well as potential new indications for previously approved products especially for Xeljanz. ","Adjusted SI&A expenses however decreased by 2% operationally because of continued benefits from cost reduction of productivity initiatives partially offset by investment to support several recent product launches and other inline brands. Adjusted diluted EPS is favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and few diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 159 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to ongoing share purchases. Reported diluted EPS was $0.19 compared with $0.39 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of the charge for the 850 million upfront payments associated with the Global Strategic Alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November of 2014, and an additional amount of approximately $300 million reflecting the fair value of certain co-promotional rights for Xalkori granted to Merck KGaA. ","Higher charges related to certain legal matters as well as the higher effective tax rate, all of which were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, and purchase accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 14 versus the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted revenues by $453 million or 3% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses and the aggregate by $351 million or 4%. As a result foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared with the year-ago quarter. ","Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 6% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the US and Japan; and the performance from recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the US, all of which was somewhat offset by the previously mentioned expiration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the US and Canada. Income before taxes declined 5% operationally due to a 5% operational increase in cost of sales; a 25% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investment in new products such as Eliquis and Xeljanz and certain inline brands; and a 25% operational increase in R&D expenses due to incremental investments in late-stage pipeline products namely bococizumab, ertugliflozin and additional Xeljanz indications. ","Fourth Quarter VOC revenues increased 14% operationally due primarily to strong performance of Prevnar 13 Adult in the US and Xalkori globally, Inlyta in most markets and [indiscernible] in emerging markets as well as Nexium 24HR in the US. Income before taxes increased 13% operationally mainly due to increased revenues which were partially offset by a 12% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales decreased by thirty basis points due to a favorable change in product mix. ","A 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in Prevnar Adult as well as launch and pre-launch expenses for Trumenba and Ibrance, and a 17% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased investment in the Ibrance and Trumenba development programs, and the global alliance with Merck KGaA. In the fourth quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 7% operationally year-over-year due to loss of exclusivity of Celebrex in the US, Detrol LA in the US and Aricept in Canada as well as determination of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva in most countries including the US. ","All of these were partially offset by a 7% operational growth in the emerging markets and the strong performance of Lyrica in Europe. Income before taxes declined operationally 9% due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase or a 2.3 percentage point increase as percentage of revenues and cost of sales due to LOEs and unfavorable changes in product mix; and a 5% operational increase in R&D expenses primarily due to our biosimilars development program partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses. All of which were partially offset by a 17% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. ","As you can see in 2014 we met or exceeded all components of our annual financial guidance. Now I would like to walk you through the 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. First, it's important to note that the 2015 reporting revenues incorporate an anticipated 3.5 billion, negative impacts due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and declining Alliance revenues which will be partially offset by expected operational growth in certain other products. ","In addition we expect foreign exchange to have an additional $2.8 billion negative impact on reported revenues. Consequently, we expect 2015 reported revenues to be in the range of $44.5 billion to $46.5 billion. Before moving on, I want to point out that the actual mid-January 2015 rates used to determine our 2015 guidance do not include the impact of a potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or any other currency. Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity, a $0.17 negative impact from foreign-exchange rates, and a negative $0.03 impact from the pending transaction of OPKO. ","As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of a $1.37 to a $1.52 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. In addition I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporates $6 million of anticipated share repurchases in 2015, including 715 million of our shares repurchased to date. These repurchases were more than offset by the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, if you exclude the FX impacts and the impact of the pending OPKO transaction, our fiscal year 2015, adjusted diluted EPS guidance midpoint is in line with full-year 2014 actual results despite the $3.5 billion negative impact from expected product LOEs and declining alliance revenues. ","Now I\u2019ll review the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance. We expect cost of sales and percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5%. We expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $12.8 billion to $13.8 billion. We expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion which includes a planned upfront payment of $295 million to OPKO expected in the first quarter of 2015 upon completion of the transaction announced in December of 2014. We also expect adjusted income to be approximately $500 million. And we expect our tax rates on adjusted income to be approximately 25%. ","Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our full-year 2014 financial in an environment that continues to be challenging. We advanced our strategy through pipeline advancement and business development. The FDA approved Trumenba, our meningitis B vaccine and we announced that we are in labeling discussions with the FDA for Ibrance. And we entered into a collaboration with Merck KGaA which positions us well to potentially compete in the first wave of immuno-oncology therapies and be a leader in the second wave of combination therapies. ","Our full-year 2015 reported revenue guidance range includes the anticipated negative impact of $3.5 billion with the product losses of exclusivity of $2.8 billion due to adverse changes in foreign exchange, partially offset by nearly $2 billion of anticipated operational revenue growth in certain products. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes a $0.17 negative impact from foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact from the planned upfront payment to OPKO. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. Overall in 2014 we returned nearly 12 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ","From 2011 through 2014 we returned more than 64 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition in 2015, we anticipate returning approximately $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond. Now I will turn it back to Chuck. ","Chuck Triano","Thank you sir. Operator can we please poll for questions. Thanks. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you very much. Ian, just a question for you sort of high-level. Based on all of the press reports that we are all reading everyday, it sounds like you're intensely focused on landing a large target and these articles are all saying those companies are rebuffing you. I think this is a great opportunity for you to sort of remind us what are your strategic objectives? Do you have to make a large transaction and if so, is it -- I mean it would seem to me that it's the GEP business that would need the biggest growth drivers, or is it the other areas of the business? ","If you could just sort of prioritize for us, which of the areas of the business make most sense for you for a large transaction if indeed that's what you believe you need? And then just a second question, and may be this is for Frank. On the GEP business is it permissible for you guys to buy a foreign company and use it as a new address when you potentially go to spin out if you decide to do so in your GEP business, is that actually an option? Thanks very much. ","Ian Read","Thank you Jami for the question. You know rumors are rumors. We don\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation or what they write in the press. I will go back to my comment on BD and neighbors strategy. Our strategy is to deploy our capital the way that is shareholder friendly. We\u2019ve been doing that, we\u2019ve done some buybacks and we have been doing BD. You know I would look at BD as a potential always to accelerate incremental value to shareholders. ","That's the purpose of deploying that capital, strengthening our businesses and we look at all opportunities to do that. But we do that in a disciplined manner. You know we did not push, we only did what was reasonable to do the AZ deal. I don't feel that we need to do a large deal. I do believe though that we can deploy capital in a way that it can improve return to shareholders. ","Frank D Amelio","And then Jami on the second question where you were specific to the GEP business and I think the question was buying a foreign company and potentially changing the address. Now my answer is it\u2019s kind of one of those things that's almost impossible to speculate upon. You know it's very situational. It depends on lots of things, valuations, markets and the like, and tax reforms is an ongoing area where I think that's still subject to change. So I don't want to speculate on that, you know it may or may not happen as a result of some hypothetical acquisition I would say. ","Chuck Triano","Operator, can we move to the next question please? ","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. ","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much, just a couple of questions here. It\u2019s first for Ian. I believe you mentioned that your business development is now focused on creating value in the near-term given the way of stage pipeline. I guess if it\u2019s a shift from the prior focus of what we are thinking about in 2014? And then the second question on business development, when you look at valuations resetting kind of across the biopharma space, is that reducing the opportunity set as you look at these targets given the valuation discipline you piloted for Pfizer? ","Ian Read","Well I think you know if we would have seen -- we would have been concerned about the state of our research and if we hadn\u2019t strengthened our research as we did with the deal with Merck on the immuno-oncology asset, then we may have felt we needed to do more business development in acquiring assets in our research. But I feel our research pipeline middle-stage, late-stage is strong and I would rather take our capital right now and direct it to opportunities to accelerate the EPS growth as I think we\u2019ve got the right balance of capital allocation in the medium to long-term and on the innovative side. ","So it\u2019s just with your balance of where you are deploying your capital and where you think you\u2019ve areas you want to strengthen. That been said, if there was a piece of intellectual property that added huge value we thought, we could develop it and we would not be shy in acquiring that intellectual property. I do think that the values are high at the moment in many sectors. We're disciplined, but you know when we find an appropriate deal that will meet our strategies of strengthening our businesses and accelerating shareholder value, we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ve the ability to do those deals. ","Chuck Triano","Operator, next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. ","Mark Schoenebaum ","Thank you very much for taking the question. First of all congrats to Frank, great P&L management this quarter and also for the guidance. If I may ask some R&D questions on the PCSK-9 program, could you just update us if you would be willing to do so on the timelines and the enrolment status for the outcomes trials on the PCSK-9 program. Number two, I was intrigued by your comments during the prepared remarks on immuno-oncology where you -- I think you mentioned that how you thought you would be among the first three companies to launch in several or a few tumor types. I\u2019ve been wondering if you would be willing to tell us what tumor types you think that could be. ","And then finally on palbo and I suppose this is more of a commercial question. And just as we all contemplate a near-term launch as a clear possibility, can you help us frame the initial market opportunities. Do you expect this to be a very rapid cancer watch or something with a little bit more tempered since these women have a standard of care today. Thank you. ","Ian Read","Thank you Mark, good questions. Perhaps Geno can address the PCSK-9 status and then I\u2019ll ask that we -- we\u2019ll then move to answer your questions on palbo and which products that we can give you first or second in from Albert. Geno? ","Geno Germano","Sure, thanks Mark. Regarding the PCSK-9 program, our outcomes trial, we're in the process of ramping up you know site initiation, enrolment. This is something we monitor frankly on a daily and weekly basis. So we are making good progress there. We expect to be competitive with the other programs from Amgen and Sanofi in terms of timing for a completion of those outcomes trials, you know which we currently see occurring in late 17 or 18 timeframe. ","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno. Albert? ","Albert Bourla","Yes on the question on the initial Ibrance launch update, we're very excited about this initial launch for two main reasons. First we have not seen an approval of a new therapy in the first line advanced cancer in more than ten years, so there is a great unmet need. And secondly Ibrance has demonstrated not only a statistical significant improvement, but more importantly a clinically meaningful benefit to patients. Because that would be our first and added 10 months to respond to [indiscernible]. As a result we expect the uptake to be robust. ","Having said that, as with [indiscernible] there will be some oncology, but it will [indiscernible] adapter. But while others will wait for additional data or more experience in the field. But for this group we already have four Phase 3 trials ongoing, two of which are expected to complete this year. When you say that we're working to build a broad franchise on breast cancer. We're starting with first line metastatic breast cancer. But then we're moving fast to the current breast cancer and then to early breast cancer. And we would like to remind everyone what we're currently running Phase 3 pivotal registration enabling studies for all of these indications. ","Now to your question on immuno-oncology. As Ian said, the deal is transformational for our immuno-oncology program for two reasons. And the first it is that they enable us to quickly move into the first wave of potential monotherapy treatments. You asked for some examples of that, the examples would be ovarian or gastric for example. And this is where we're going to see to put our emphasis rather than on indications that are more crowded as melanoma for example. But then for the second also benefit which enable us to accelerate our combinations program by more than 2.5 years. This accelerates in conjunction with our broad range of combination assets Xeljanz, Inlyta, Ibrance, our gross inhibitor OX40, 4-1BB would enable us to be the leading player in the second wave where we see also a much greater portion of the bite. ","Chuck Triano","Operator next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. ","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks good morning and a couple of unrelated questions. Firstly and to slice the M&A question a different way. It's clear you have a sense of urgency to find deals that could be if there is shareholder enhancing. Can you care to comment on the sense of urgency that supplement the innovative versus the established products? You\u2019ve made it clear that you\u2019ve got near-term sort of accretion or value accretion versus long term. But I want to make sure we understand that you are so committed to both or is one taking precedence. Secondly can you comment on Lyrica CR, obviously a large product that gets almost no focus? Are you planning to attempt the filing there to protect some of that franchise longer term. And lastly Albert, can you comment on Prevnar Adult versus pediatric in progress there? And maybe share some color around the split between those two important buckets. Thank you. ","Ian Read","Okay, Geno do you want to talk about Lyrica first and then Albert can talk about the vaccine and I will come back on our BD preferences or priorities. ","Geno Germano","Yeah so Gregg on the Lyrica program we continue to advance the CR program for Lyrica. We\u2019ve completed several trials and seen positive outcomes. So we will continue to move towards a registration and we expect to see registration potentially ahead of the expiration of the exclusivity in the United States. ","Albert Bourla","Yes, Gregg on the adult, although early we're very pleased with the launch. And we believe this is potentially a very large and doable opportunity given current demographics and the aging trends. The adult sales in US were around $250 million which was driven by higher penetration during the high flu season and of course also some inventory stocking with new customers. Our market share down to almost four times to 45% from 12 originally. Growth, moving forward we still expect to be strong throughout the year. Of course keep in mind, but this quarter is influenced by seasonality and some inventory build and that can vary quarter by quarter. On the pediatric that you asked, pediatric in fact was down this quarter due to the timing of the CDC purchase, but last year occurred in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter and the [indiscernible]. ","Ian Read","Thank you on the urgency to do business development, let me stress. The urgency I\u2019ve is to create shareholder value and if business development can do that, then we will move on business development with urgency. I don't really have a preference between strengthening either of our businesses. I think we can use this development to improve and strengthen both of them and we will look at the deals and if the deals make sense we\u2019ll attempt to execute them. ","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Operator next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein. ","Tim Anderson","Hi I am sorry. It\u2019s the same line of questioning but on inversion. So is that in your view pretty much off the table at this point for Pfizer? Is that still something that you think you can pursue and then also on inversion, any visibility on when or whether Treasury might come out with a second round of regulations? And then on the pipeline, apart from palbo if you had to take two compounds that excite you the most, what would those be? ","Ian Read","Okay so on the inversion, Tim. You know inversions have not been stopped. So what the potential rules of the government have done is delayed the value or potentially delayed the value realization of the inversion. So you know inversions I think are being tempered by the ability to pay the target price given the slow realization of the inversion values. You know I think it's an area that will remain fertile while there is no change in the US tax laws. I think it's -- we are in a very uncompetitive situation with our tax code. And inversions will continue to be important as an instrument increasing shareholder value just depending on the price you need to pay to the inversion. ","And the exact conditions of the inversion which are very technical depending on how you can manage your subsequent cash flows. So it\u2019s a very -- it's not an easy general answer to what type of inversion you would want to do. And apart from palbo you know I think we\u2019ve a lot of exciting products. I would probably talk about the ability to bring the staph aureus vaccine to market as quickly as possible. I think you know bococizumab clearly has a huge potential. I think we are well placed with the clinical trial design. [indiscernible] is well positioned. Adult vaccine which we\u2019ve just launched has a huge potential. ","So I find it difficult to really take just two assets. I think we have a lot of assets that we can create value from and especially the total life cycle of palbociclib. So the new Treasury regulations, you know I don't know. I mean I'm not in Washington, I can't comment. They have published a rule, they haven't finalized a rule. And you know clearly there is an intent to do that. There is an intent to make it somewhat more problematic or for people to plan inversions and we will just have to work around that. Thank you. ","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Operator moving on please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. ","Vamil Divan","Yeah thanks for taking the questions. So I have two, one I guess, the first one is more for Ian. Obviously a lot of discussion around the M&A and what you guys are looking to do. I guess just strategically you know some comments earlier about valuations and people you're approaching and maybe not you know wanting to go ahead with the deal. I think strategically isn\u2019t it tougher for you to consummate a deal when you are being so public talking about the need to do something and the near-term focus that you are mentioning. Now doesn\u2019t that make it tougher to get a deal done and doesn\u2019t it just raise the prices higher. ","And then second one is more on the pipeline. If you could talk about I\/O, I appreciate the comments you gave earlier and thanks for all that. Can you talk a little bit about kind on the biomarker side and if there\u2019s anything you can share but how you are planning to incorporate biomarkers at least into the first wave of study that you\u2019ve outlined for this year? Thanks. ","Ian Read","Yeah Vamil, I am sort of intrigued by your comments. I don't think I\u2019ve ever said, we\u2019ve to do a deal. I think you are reading the press rather than what I've been saying. If I felt there was a pressure to do the deal, we would have done the deal and we're trying to do it last year. We're very disciplined. We don't feel we need to do a big deal. I do feel we have the ability and we have the balance sheet that we can use if business development can further our basic strategies which is to strengthen either one of our businesses or to acquire in an area like immuno-oncology which we did to strengthen where we see we can create synergy and values. ","So you know I am a little mystified about this -- your comment about you know that Pfizer sort of needs to do a deal. I think there\u2019s a lot of rumors running around. We as like any management team look at opportunities. We have the capital and the wherewithal to do the deal should we so decide. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of is there a value and if there is value we can get the deal done. So I'm a little you know, I hope that puts in perspective for all of where we fit on business development deals. Good to do, if they create shareholder value, disciplined, if they don't we are not doing them. Yeah, Biomarkers. ","Geno Germano","Yeah so you know that's a great question on how you bring immuno quality to the next level. And first as you know we\u2019ve considerable experience in selecting and developing biomarkers from Xalkori we\u2019ve obviously linked that to the drug\u2019s efficacy and we\u2019ve also learnt how to drive uptake of that diagnostic to very high rates in the marketplace, specifically for immuno-oncology. So in our partnership on avelumab we certainly are looking at PDL-1 high versus low tumors. And the data we see really correlates as expected with high response in the PDL-1 high. ","But we also see responses in the PDL low. We had a second wave as you heard from Albert on the 4-1BB and OX40 for combination. We\u2019ve seen that the 4-1BB is unique in amplifying cytotoxic cells, CD8 cells. So we certainly will look for expression of those cells in the tumor. Similarly for OX40 we think it\u2019s more under CD4 side and that will be another marker to monitor. But we also have programs coming on board for T-regulatory cells that may limit the overall immuno-oncology response and tumor suppressing macrophages. And we\u2019ve assets coming within the next year or so on each of those particular subset of immuno-oncology. ","And of course our ADC portfolio is very much supported by diagnostics. We\u2019ve now two ADC in Phase 1 that show interesting responses and we stocked enriched pile of diagnostic for those. So I hope you get the sense that we go from standard diagnostic to more next-generation diagnostic. And we will also deal with the kind of future diagnostic looking at circulating tumor cells to make it even more easy to integrate in medical practice. So we really see us being a driver of this change and the pioneer in this area. Thank you. ","Chuck Triano","Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust. ","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions. The first question, just going back to business development as an enabling strategy. Ian, I think you indicated that one of the primary reasons for the AstraZeneca transaction was the tax considerations obviously around the inversion and being able to unleash the value of the cash that you have trapped offshore. If you go back and look at the last transaction, your tax rate around that time was around 22%. You know it's gone as high as 27% not enabling you to bring that cash back. How much consideration is there that when you do a transaction how much impact on the tax rate are you willing to absorb if it is an US asset that you're looking to acquire? ","The second question is for Frank, you\u2019ve disclosed what the impact of foreign exchange is, can you articulate or quantify what the impact is on volume and price on growth in 2014. And then the last question on R&D and Xeljanz in EU, any update on your ability to file Xeljanz in Europe and then the implications for the Enbrel field force over there? Especially in light of Samsung filing their SB4 and anticipating to be commercializing at least [indiscernible] commercializing Enbrel in the back half and how are you going to be adjusting for that resource if you don't have Xeljanz there? Thanks. ","Ian Read","John thank you. As always good questions. Why don\u2019t you, Geno deal with the issue of Xeljanz in Europe and Frank can look at the volume question and I\u2019ll come back to your rather complicated question on inversions and tax rates and in that Frank will also help me out there a bit. ","Geno Germano","Yeah so John regarding Xeljanz and the Enbrel inflammation business in Europe. You know we remain committed to resubmitting for approval an RA for Xeljanz in Europe. We\u2019ve had recent interactions with regulators there and a discussion on our chance for resubmission. We were encouraged by those discussions. We continue to collect additional clinical data to support that resubmission and our expectations are that we will resubmit by the end of the year in 2015. Regarding Enbrel and potential competition, you know we see the introduction of biosimilars into the marketplace in Europe as something that's more evolutionary than transitionary. And we expect to continue to support Enbrel through the near term and realize you know continued support from that franchise. So I don't see a disruption at this point with the timing that we are anticipating and the impact that we see projected for biosimilars. ","Ian Read","And of course that market in Europe is very under-penetrated given their reluctance. So you know there is a lot of volume there that can be accessed via biosimilars as well as the original. Frank? ","Frank D Amelio","So John for the quarter and this is companywide, so price is +1% volume was -1%, foreign exchange was -3%, FX drove the -3% for the quarter at. And as I mentioned on my comments, we are actually up operationally by 9 million excluding foreign exchange for the quarter. For the full year price was +2%, volume was -4%, FX was -2%. You put that together and you get the -4% I reported for the year. ","Ian Read","Thank you and on the BD you know I think my comments on AV have always been that we looked at three components of value. One was the pipeline; two was the amount of operational energies that could be achieved; and third was the financial synergies. And you know we were disciplined in our approach, because the financial synergies were the most risky part of the equation, and in fact were made eventually more difficult to achieve by the proposals. I think the net-net answer to your question about tax rates is it all goes into the value. What is the value of the acquisition we're trying to achieve? What\u2019s the value we create to shareholders? ","And the tax rate just like the synergies, just like expenses, just like everything else is part of that value equation. If it works, the value works we will do the deal. If the value doesn't work we won't do the deal. But of course undeniably the foreign companies as you seen for most of the acquisitions that have occurred in the last year, foreign companies do have an advantage given their tax rate. And this is something that you know should be of a concern to the US economy. ","Frank D Amelio","I think the only thing I would add Ian is, John in your question you mentioned before we announced live it was 22% and we took it up to 27%. We actually took it up to 30%. When we announced live we took the tax rate from 22% to 30%. And we\u2019ve been you know, I think in an effective way being able to step it down through a combination of changes and jurisdictional mix and tax planning. We\u2019ve gone from 30 to 29 to 28. This past year, we\u2019ve had said approximately 27, we printed 26.5 on adjusted results. And now we\u2019ve got it for 2015 to approximately 25%. ","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Next question please operator. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. ","David Risinger","Yes thanks very much. I have two questions. Frank in the context of a potential split up in the future, you have obviously set up the financials but could you please discuss the dissynergies and the risk of pro forma total cost being higher due to step-up cost if a separation were pursued in the future. And then second for Mikael, could you please discuss the top three or four pipeline readouts to watch in 2015 so specifically what clinical trial readouts are most important to focus on? Thank you. ","Ian Read","Please, Frank. ","Frank D Amelio","So Dave, the way I think about the split question you asked me is, in my mind there will be basically three key determinants to obviously whether or not we separate the company. One is the performance of the businesses. The second one would be our confidence level and as businesses continue to perform successfully on a standalone basis. And then three would be how the market values of those businesses and quite frankly is there an opportunity to create a tax efficient way of incremental value. So is the sum of the parts creating the whole, is there an ability to unlock that value? That value part of the answer in my mind would factor in the items you raised like the synergies. That's all part of the value of the question that we would have to factor in to get to a net-net positive along with the aforementioned standalone performances. ","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah and let me mention a couple of readouts. So obviously from [indiscernible] we are you know excited to also get to readout from our recurring study combining with [indiscernible] that Albert spoke about. Avelumab, our partnership with Merck Serono around ASCO will be the first time we start to share and update the data set. And I think there will be opportunity also later to hear about how combinations are progressing. And possibly late in the year that we will also share some date on the 4-1BB, our own trial as we're running in lymphoma. We also have the readouts in ulcerative colitis and mid of the year or so we\u2019ve topline results from induction study with Xeljanz. And please remember in Phase 2 Xeljanz has very strong induction data among the best that has been really presented in the field. ","And at the JPMorgan I also shared very robust and really interesting data from our MAdCAM antibody in UC. So you could really look upon UC as a space where we\u2019ve multiple interesting data sets. More near term you also have an opportunity to look at Inotuzumab in [ALL] which we\u2019ll have an analysis for complete respond or complete response with the incomplete hemitological recovery. ","Chuck Triano","Our next question please operator. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. ","Seamus Fernandez","Oh, thanks very much for the questions. You know first off, maybe Frank, can you just walk us through when we\u2019ve an increased spending coming in -- well maybe not increased spending, but you know good cost controls overall. But is there a more to achieve or be taken out of the business from here where you can be opportunistic as we\u2019ve towards you know the potential loss of Lyrica, and some incremental pressures? Are we off an overall growth of trajectory on the business including the expense base as we think about 2015 plus? And then separately as we think the PCSK-9 opportunity, I think there has been a real emphasis on the outcomes from Pfizer. ","But Pfizer has also demonstrated an ability to succeed in the statin space without outcomes. So just wondering despite being third to market, how you would anticipate completing before perhaps outcomes are available, and could you be as a third to market product -- how would you expect to compete without outcomes, you know versus other competitors who likely won\u2019t have outcomes data, either? Thanks. ","Ian Read","Okay Frank on spending. ","Frank D Amelio","So our spending Seamus, I\u2019ve said this before. Clearly we're in the late innings in terms of having cost reduction. There is still opportunities. I think there\u2019s always opportunities. I think there continues to be opportunities and G&A for example continues to be opportunities with our portfolio as the portfolio ebbs and flows. So there\u2019s clearly opportunities related to the portfolio. And that said, it\u2019s hard. You know Ian mentioned in his comments that we\u2019ve taken out 5.5 billion in expenses, in operating expenses over the last four years. There\u2019s not another $5.5 billion for example to take, and so it\u2019s getting harder. ","And then if you look at our results for 2014, I\u2019ll give you the full-year numbers operationally. COGS was up 2%, SI&A was down 2%, R&D was up 9%. You know clearly that upward pressure in R&D, we printed 7.2 billion in that 2014 as an actual number we got it to $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion for 2015. That includes the 300 million upfront to OPKO. But I think R&D, you know OPKO aside is going to be in the low 7s, kind of you know going forward. So that's good upward pressure in my mind in terms of the late stage portfolio progressing in a good way. So I think I am probably more than you need, but I think the short answer is there is always opportunities. But you know we don\u2019t have the same opportunities we had several years ago, from the base we\u2019ve done a much better job I think in managing the base. ","Ian Read","I\u2019ll just add to Frank\u2019s comments. You know that -- that what we're looking is sort of transition from dealing with some $26 billion of LOEs from 2010 through 2015. And the need to rationalize our cost base to one of the investing in the future growth which I think is basically the most desirable state to be in as the topline growth. And we're investing in our Phase 3 pipeline and our innovative products. But this management team is very good at managing our P&L and our investment and where we invest. And you know are prepared to do what\u2019s necessary if business circumstances change on our expense base. With that the other question was for Geno on [indiscernible]. ","Geno Germano","So Seamus, just to respond you know clearly we -- you know Pfizer has a long history and heritage in the cardiovascular space. And I think that you know we can leverage that knowledge and obviously the data from our clinical trials to determine the best approach in the marketplace. Frankly we really expect the PCSK-9 market to you know emerge as a large and attractive market with the occurrence of the outcomes data and we're kind of most focused on that. We\u2019ve obviously put our best thinking forward in our protocol designs. And should we have you know stronger data then the other companies in the cholesterol management and we will leverage that. But at this point, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how the data turns out. And again our focus is mainly on the outcomes, on our trails. ","Chuck Triano","Next question, please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. ","Steve Scala","Thank you, I have two questions. First for Frank, is the 400 million in spend for a potential company split in non-GAAP guidance and what happens to this number in 2016? Is it the same, is it higher or is it lower? And then the second question is on pablociclib, has the FDA taken a look or do you expect it to take a look prior to April 13 at the Phase 3 trial which is underway? Thank you. ","Frank D Amelio","So on the 400 million Steve, it\u2019s in GAAP, it\u2019s not in adjusted. We actually called that out in the release. It\u2019s in the bridge we give you all, that bridge is from adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS. I think the bridge shows, it starts at the top. It shows $2 to $2.10 and then we\u2019ve three takeaways from that. There is purchase accounting adjustments for $0.41. There is restructuring and implementation cost that has a range of $0.13 to $0.18. And then there is a business and legal entity alignment cost which is the $400 million you allude to, which is $0.04. And that's the bridge from $2.10 $to 2.20, the 137 to 152. ","So in GAAP, not an adjustment. And we give you a bridge that breaks out how we get from point A to point B. In terms of 2016 quite frankly as we get towards the end of the year early next year, we will call that number out to you because a lot of that depends on how we will progress through the year, how the businesses perform. And so that's something that we will call out obviously later in this year or early in 2016. ","Ian Read","Albert on pablociclib [indiscernible]? ","Albert Bourla","Yes for Ibrance I don\u2019t want to speak [indiscernible] what the FDA would like to do but from a timing perspective we don't expect to have the results of even if the interim review of Phase 3 before the PDUFA date. And as you know we're already in the late-stage discussions for [indiscernible]. ","Chuck Triano","Next question please, operator. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. ","Jeff Holford","Hi thanks for taking my question. The first one is for Ian which is really what do you think about business development the way you used the US cash on US targets. There is one inversion just straight M&A type deal as a potential pragmatic way to deal with the tax situation on those overseas cash assets? Do you see potential opportunities to do that and then just a few financial questions. As you want to be able to allow investors to see the value in the two separate pieces what do you think about giving mid-term guidance on the true potential separate pieces for investors to help them reach that decision and how you reach that decision. ","And do you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that this is now the flow and in 2015 another flow inside the revenues and EPS going forward? And then lastly are you happy that we just extrapolate this year\u2019s tax rate going forward, are there any of the factors that we should consider? ","Ian Read","Okay you know I\u2019ll let Frank answer your modeling questions. On the BD in using offshore cash for offshore deals, once again it comes down to value, it comes down to you know the offshore deals often price in the fact that there is offshore cash. So you have to look at the price tag on the deals and see if they make sense. But certainly conceptually you know you have a point that it just comes down to the quality of the asset and the deals you're trying to do. And Frank on the other question? ","Frank D Amelio","Yeah so let me let me hit the -- Jeff, let me hit the extrapolation of the tax rates first. I think the way I will answer your question is, we step it down this year to approximately 25%. That's down from 26.5% in 14. So a nice decrease and please know that when we reduce the rate, like we do in for 2015, our intention is that that rate is sustainable for the foreseeable future. You know so that, that's how I would answer your question. In terms to trying to provide guidance beyond 2015, for tax rates. Given all the uncertainty in the tax environment, you know I think that wouldn\u2019t be a prudent thing to do. ","In terms of your question on BUs and providing midterm type of guidance -- I think we are getting more and more transparent I think relative to our business units. This year we started providing a very detailed income state information. Come 2015, we are going to start to provide -- you know so then we\u2019ll start to provide some balance sheet information, so we are providing more and more information. And I think it enables a lot of good extrapolation work. In terms of you know taking our guidance and peeling it down to another level, I just -- I think it's hard enough to provide annual guidance total company. You then start taking and slicing it by sub ledger detail I think. It just really creates a level of complexity that I don't think we are inclined to do. ","Chuck Triano","Next question please operator. ","Operator","Next question from Marc Goodman from UBS. ","Marc Goodman","Good morning. First of all can you give us an update on China? How did it perform in the quarter and how you are expecting it to perform in 2015, you know give us some trends there? Second just update on palbo overseas and what the timing is there. And then on the MAdCAM, you did provide some data. And I was curious if you could comment on the dose response. And on why it would take some while to move into Phase 3? I think you said you're going to move into Phase 3 in 2016. And then I think the Phase 2s are done, so I was curious about that. And then lastly just on Lipitor over-the-counter? I know there was one study that remains before you can go back and talk to FDA. I was curious where we stand on that and when you think you\u2019ll talking to FDA again? Thanks. ","Ian Read","Okay let's try and put it together. So if Albert can answer the palbo one and the Lipitor questions? ","Albert Bourla","Yes, we\u2019ve had discussions with European regulatory [indiscernible] on the clinical data. And it is our intention to file in the EU this year. The anticipated filing packets will build off of what was submitted to the FDA, but it\u2019s too early to provide more details on that. Coming to Lipitor, you are right. The actual use trial was completed in December of 2014 and the results are expected in the second quarter. So once we see the results, then we\u2019ll define our next steps in our efforts to being [indiscernible]. ","Ian Read","Okay, John China. ","John Young","So thanks for the question, Marc. So we continue to perform strongly in China. I\u2019ll comment on the GEP segment which is the largest segment of our business in China. Overall for the quarter, we had a growth of 13%. Overall for the year we\u2019ve had a growth of roundabout 18%. You know we continue to see as we always do in the American markets quarter to quarter fluctuation and we continue to be very satisfied by our performance in China. The segments that are you know strong for us are particularly our cardiovascular franchise with Lipitor and Norvasc performing strongly. And also a very strong performance our anti-infective business. ","Ian Read","Thank you, now MAdCAM. ","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah so thank you for noticing the very interesting dose response that we shared with you. We do think it represents possibly through human biology that at the mid-doses, 22 to 75 milligram. And in that range we possibly inhibit the autoimmune cells causing disease. While at the higher doses you may also start to interfere with -- T-cells that have a protective effect. So it is very important to have done a very thorough dose response that can allow you to select the optimal dose. And we think it may distinguish our opportunity MAdCAM versus other endocrine antibodies that may not have been able to do such a thorough dose response and pick the sweet spot. ","And that actually if you look at our remission dates, they really perform well versus either other published comparison, although it\u2019s historical comparison. Concerning the timelines, so we certainly see if we can accelerate it, but that relates to production of clinical trial manufacturing for potential registration study. And also to really understand how to design a study where you could best develop a drug that has this really, unique tolerability profile, both for induction and maintenance therapy and how it could play as an anchor drug across many IBD like conditions. And that's why we gave a little bit of a extended time period. And we maybe able to shorten that as we go forward. ","Chuck Triano","Thank you Mikael, and operator if we could take our last question, please. ","Operator","Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital. ","Alex Arfaei","Good morning and I apologize if I ask redundant questions. I got disconnected briefly. Ian, from your perspective could you comment on the M&A landscape in general? Based on your conversations with management teams, are you finding willing sellers out there and is it just a matter of price? The follow up for Frank and just following up on your earlier comments, how should we think about your margins for the next couple of years? You are losing some high margin products. You\u2019ve said most of the cost cutting is done, and you are investing in launches. So is it fair to expect somewhat stable or perhaps slightly declining margins going forward? Thank you. ","Ian Read","So you know Alex on the price, you know willing sellers. Price always determines whether you\u2019ve a willing seller or not normally. It\u2019s just a matter of what value you want to transfer. And what I would say is I think the starting point of the prices are somewhat buoyant shall we say, given where the market place is. So that does give you some concern when you look at paying the type of prices, there are premiums you need off what we see as high valuations to begin with. So we're being disciplined in how we look at that and then would you like to answer the margin question? ","Frank D Amelio","Yeah, so Alex I think a very good question in terms of -- I\u2019ll call it the rhythm of the margins. There is some -- I\u2019ll call it some downward pressure on our operating margins. So we\u2019ve got $3.5 billion LOEs next year and some high margin products clearly putting some downward pressure in the operating margins. And we\u2019ve given guidance where you can obviously go through the line items and compute the numbers. That said, all of that\u2019s factored into our EPS guidance. And I want to reiterate what I said before, if you exclude foreign exchange in the outcomes transaction, the midpoint of our guidance for the next year is roughly what we printed in 2014 despite that $3.5 billion in LOEs. So we\u2019ll continue to manage our cost structure, obviously the opportunities aren\u2019t what they used to be. But there is some slight -- ","[Abrupt End]"],"16890":["Pfizer Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2019 performance and our updated 2019 financial guidance. We appreciate your flexibility today. I know it's been a busy morning for everyone.","I'm joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at pfizer.com\/investors. You'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Also any discussion related to our recently announced proposed transaction with Mylan to combine Upjohn and Mylan to create a new global pharmaceutical company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are discussed under the forward-looking statements section in the press release we issued this morning. Today's call is not intended and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making in the business, the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline, and our ongoing work to advocate for policies that support affordable access for patients.","But before I address these topics, I would like to make a few comments regarding our recent activities to reshape our company including the agreement we announced this morning.","We have been very busy. We recently completed the Therachon acquisition. We expect to close the Array acquisition very soon. We are about to create the joint venture with GSK for our consumer business and we just announced the proposed agreement with Mylan for our Upjohn business.","When all these actions are complete, Pfizer will be a smaller, more focused, science-based company with a singular focus on innovative pharma. We believe we will be in a position where our pipeline will be able to move the needle even more dramatically in terms of our long-term growth prospects.","In fact, we see our growth profile improving in three ways. We expect our five-year revenue CAGR to be higher than it otherwise would have been. We see the growth starting earlier because the Lyrica LOE cliff will go away. And given our smaller size, we believe the growth will be more sustainable.","We also will still have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth while returning capital to our investors. These are deliberate steps we are taking to make Pfizer a very different company and one that is even better equipped to fulfill our purpose; breakthroughs that change patients' lives.","Now, let me talk about the quarter. I am pleased to report that our performance for both the quarter and the first half of the year has been solid. In the second quarter, revenues were up 2% operationally company-wide. Our growth was driven again by volume increases, partially offset by price declines.","If we look at our Biopharmaceuticals Group which represented 72% of our revenue base this quarter, the volume increases had an even bigger impact on the growth despite a net pricing decline in the quarter.","Overall, we saw volume growth in several key brands emerging markets and biosimilars. These growth drivers were partially offset primarily by the continued impact of the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a 20% operational decline in Upjohn's revenues in China, declines in Enbrel internationally, and Lyrica in the U.S. and EU, and also product supply shortages and LOEs in the hospital business.","Let's begin with the results from the Biopharmaceuticals Group. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business which grew its top line 6% operationally in the quarter. Our Oncology business was particularly strong, up 23% operationally driven by Ibrance, Xtandi, Inlyta, and RETACRIT.","Global revenues for Ibrance were up 27% operationally in the quarter to $1.3 billion. While most of Ibrance growth continues to come from international markets, we did see 12% growth in the U.S. during the second quarter. We believe this accelerated growth rate is the result of our effort to target specific physicians who had not been prescribing CDK inhibitors or had prescribed them to only a small set of patients. Overall, the CDK class appears to have gained additional ground in the U.S. which is good news for patients.","For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. grew 18% operationally to $201 million. Xtandi is the leading branded novel for monotherapy to treat castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We continue to see increased Xtandi prescriptions for new patients.","Inlyta revenues increased 34% operationally to $104 million. This included 82% growth in the U.S. Inlyta has benefited from recent FDA approvals for the combination of Inlyta plus Bavencio and Inlyta plus pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.","Finally, RETACRIT, our biosimilar for Epogen and Procrit, is off to a good start in the U.S. with $30 million of revenues in its second full quarter following launch.","Beyond Oncology, we had several other strong product performances. Xeljanz continued to perform well. Global revenues were up 36% operationally to $613 million. We saw continued volume growth in the rheumatoid arthritis indication. And the recent launches of ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis also contributed to the growth.","Regarding the update to Xeljanz prescribing information in the U.S., we remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which has been studied in more than 20 clinical trials and prescribed to more than 208,000 adult patients worldwide. At this stage, we do expect some impact to prescribing. But based on our initial commercial assessment, we believe that on an enterprise level the 2019 impact will be offset by strengths in other parts of the business. Xeljanz remains an important treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis in appropriate patients who are suffering from these debilitating autoimmune conditions.","Eliquis continues to perform well. Global revenues were up 26% operationally to $1.1 billion. Eliquis is now the number one oral anticoagulant in 10 countries including the U.S. and the U.K. Our recent launch of Tafamidis with the brand name of Vyndaqel has been in line with our expectations. As the first and only FDA-approved treatment for patients suffering from ATTR-Cardiomyopathy, Vyndaqel meets a previously unmet need. We have in place programs to help support affordable access for patients and we are working to facilitate early detection and diagnosis through the use of scintigraphy and by developing innovative AI solutions. AI I mean artificial intelligence solutions.","In fact, we have already seen a significant increase in diagnosis rates and since the launch have added approximately 500 commercial patients to the approximately 900 clinical trial and compassionate use patients that were already on the drug for ATTR-Cardiomyopathy in the U.S. We expect these numbers to grow as awareness and diagnosis rates increase.","Prevnar 13 pediatric revenues were negatively impacted by some government purchasing patterns in the year-ago quarter as well as during the first quarter of this year. However, year-to-date, it is performing in line. It is important to note that even with the recent change in its recommendation ACIP maintains a recommendation for the vaccine for adults 65 and older.","However, now it is under a new classification called shared clinical decision-making, wherein the decision to vaccinate should be made at the individual level between health care providers and their patients. The vaccine also maintains its reimbursement status with payers.","While the updated recommendation is not effective until the publication of the morbidity and mortality weekly report, we will assess any impact based on the customer feedback after the language is posted. At this stage, we anticipate some reduction in demand, but we believe that on an enterprise level the 2019 impact will be offset by strengths in other parts of the business.","In sterile injectables, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top line in the U.S. We continue to make steady progress toward remediation and to expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019. Once we are back on track, we continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.","Now let me speak about Upjohn. Revenues for our Upjohn business were down 7% operationally. The main driver was China where we saw a 20% operational decline driven primarily by volume-based procurement reforms that were implemented in March 2019. These reforms unfavorably impacted Lipitor and Norvasc. This impact has been anticipated since the beginning of the year and was already included in our 2019 financial guidance.","Given first half 2019 operational growth of 13% and the outlook for the remainder of the year, revenues for Upjohn in China for the full year are expected to grow by low to mid-single digits operationally. In cities where our products did not win the tender in the second quarter, we expect continued volume growth although off a lower base.","In addition, we continue to see growth opportunities in non-tender products. We also saw a 9% decline in the U.S. The primary drivers were continued generic competition for Viagra and wholesaler destocking for Lyrica in anticipation of multi-source generic competition as well as continued industry-wide pricing challenges.","For our Consumer Healthcare, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare revenues were up 1% operationally in the quarter. This reflected 4% operational growth in international markets, partially offset by a 2% decline in the U.S. We anticipate the formation of our joint venture with GSK to occur by August 1 and we expect the newly created business to unlock meaningful value for Pfizer, our customers and our shareholders.","Turning to R&D. We continue to be excited with the progress we are making with our pipeline both in terms of the breadth of opportunities and the depth of our science. Since our last earnings call on April 30, we have received seven approvals for new medicines or indications.","In the U.S., the FDA has approved Vyndaqel and Vyndamax for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy; ZIRABEV a biosimilar to Avastin for the treatment of five different types of cancer; a new indication for Inflectra, a biosimilar for Remicade, which is now approved for pediatric patients six years of age and older, with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; Ruxience, a biosimilar to Rituxan, for the treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune conditions; and BAVENCIO in combination with Inlyta, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In Europe, the European Commission has approved TALZENNA for patients with inherited BRCA-mutated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and Lorviqua for treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We are working hard to ensure patients have access to these important medicines as soon as we can.","In addition to the approvals, we continue to make progress with other candidates in our pipeline. In vaccines, we expect a proof-of-concept data readout in the coming months from the infant Phase 2 study of our next-gen 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate. Our multivalent Group B streptococcus vaccine candidate started Phase 2 trials in pregnant women, with a study being conducted in South Africa, a region with one of the highest burdens of this potentially devastating infection.","In rare disease, we presented initial Phase 1b clinical data on our investigational gene therapy to potentially treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Data from the Phase 1b study are providing the basis for an informed decision on dose selection and the design of a currently planned Phase 3 pivotal study that could begin in the first half of 2020.","With our partner Sangamo Therapeutics, we announced updated results from the Phase 1\/2I Alta Study, evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. The FDA recently granted a regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation for this potential therapy. The tissue factor pathway inhibitor, TFPI monoclonal antibody for subcutaneous weekly treatment of hemophilia A and B met the preset criteria for proof-of-concept. It is advancing to our pivotal studies. We expect pivotal readout during the third quarter for Rivipansel in sickle cell.","In Inflammation & Immunology, we set positive top line results from a Phase 3 pivotal study of our JAK1 inhibitor Abrocitinib in patients aged 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Additional data from another study in the JADE program will be available later this year.","In internal medicine, based on our assessment of the tanezumab subcutaneous data and the initial discussion with the FDA, we will prioritize tanezumab 2.5 milligram for moderate to severe osteoarthritis. We are targeting a U.S. regulatory submission in late Q4 2019, or early 2020 to be followed by EU and Japan. At this time, regulatory submissions are not planned for the 5-milligram dose for osteoarthritis or in chronic lower back pain, but we are continuing to assess and will maintain an open dialogue with the regulatory authorities on future potential pathways for tanezumab.","Lastly, in Oncology, we are excited about the pending acquisition of Array BioPharma. We believe Array's assets fit neatly into our business and we expect the three key drivers of the acquisition, the colorectal cancer opportunity, the existing royalty stream and Array's research platform to become solid contributors to Pfizer's growth potential as we move into the next decade. We expect the deal to close in the near term.","As we have said in the past, none of our breakthroughs will do patients any good if patients can't afford them. Pfizer remains committed to working with policymakers at both the Federal and State levels and on both sides of the aisle, on common sense solutions to improve patients' affordability.","We continue to work on the policy solutions I laid out in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in February. These include capping seniors' out-of-pocket costs in Part D, incentivizing value-based arrangements and establishing a robust biosimilars market to lower healthcare costs.","In summary, we delivered a solid second quarter and first half of the year. Our pipeline is producing new medicines. Our commercial strategy is helping us reach millions of patients around the world. And most important, we continue to see volume gains as opposed to pricing gains, driving our business.","Looking ahead, we expect the pending combination of Upjohn and Mylan to allow both Pfizer and Upjohn to have a singular focus on their respective parts of the business. We believe this will enable us to deliver enhanced value for patients, colleagues and shareholders.","I also want to congratulate Michael Goettler on being named CEO of the combined company. While I personally would be sorry to see him leave Pfizer, I know from having worked closely with him for many years that the new company is getting a strong leader and the right person to help it seize the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead.","Now, I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2019.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. The charts I'm reviewing today are available on our website. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2019 revenues were approximately $13.3 billion, which reflects operational revenue growth of $324 million or 2% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $527 million or 4%.","Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 6% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2019, driven primarily by Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and by 12% operational growth in emerging markets, led by 26% operational growth in China; partially offset primarily by Enbrel internationally, primarily due to biosimilar competition in developed Europe, and the unfavorable impact of timing of purchases made by governments in certain emerging markets, and Prevnar 13 in the U.S., primarily reflecting lower government purchases for pediatric indication and continued revenue decline for the adult indication due to a declining catch-up opportunity, compared to the prior year quarter; and the hospital business in developed markets, primarily due to expected negative impact of generic competition and product supply shortages.","Revenues for our Upjohn business in the second quarter decreased 7% operationally...","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulty. Please remain on the line, and your call will resume momentarily.","Chuck Triano","Okay, folks, I think we're back. We had some technical difficulties. Apologize for that. I think at this point, we'll have Frank pick up just before where he left-off.","Frank D'Amelio","Yeah. And so, I'll start -- I'll try to connect the dots. So, as Albert stated earlier, revenues for Upjohn in China increased 13% operationally in the first half of 2019, and are expected to grow by low to mid-single digits operationally for the full year.","And the 9% decline for Upjohn in the U.S. primarily driven by lower revenues for Viagra resulting from increased generic competition and Lyrica reflecting volume declines due to wholesaler destocking in advance of anticipated multi-source generic competition, that was expected to begin on July 1, but instead began on July 19.","Revenues of our Consumer Healthcare business increased 1% operationally, reflecting 4% operational growth in international markets, primarily offset by a 2% decline in the U.S.","In the second quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.89, a $0.24 increase compared to the year-ago quarter, which was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower income tax due to an IRS audit settlement, higher revenues on an operational basis, lower acquisition-related costs and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower net gains in equity securities and foreign exchange.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.80 versus $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues on an operational basis, lower cost of sales and lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially and primarily offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange as well as lower other income.","Finally, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by approximately $280 million shares to $5.67 billion versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to Pfizer's ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018 and in the first quarter 2019, which was partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter, revenues by approximately $527 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $310 million. Consequently, foreign exchange had a $0.03 per share negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter.","Moving on to 2019 financial guidance. We updated certain components of our 2019 financial guidance primarily to reflect the anticipated August 1, 2019 formation of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the pending Array acquisition. As a result, our guidance now reflects revenues and expenses associated with the Consumer Healthcare business through July 31, 2019 but now excludes revenues and expenses from Consumer Healthcare from August 1st, through the end of the year.","Guidance now includes Pfizer's pro-rata share of the consumer JV's anticipated earnings, which will be recorded on a quarterly basis in other income\/deducts with a one-quarter lag. As a result, guidance for adjusted other income\/deducts and adjusted diluted EPS reflects Pfizer's share of only two months of earnings from the JV for the third quarter which will be recorded by Pfizer in the fourth quarter 2019. Therefore, on a net basis for the remainder of the year, the consumer JV is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS, representing the foregone PCS earnings, contribution from August through the end of the year, partially offset by the two months of equity income from the JV.","Our guidance update also incorporates the expected impact from the anticipated near-term completion of the Array acquisition, and to a much lesser extent the Therachon acquisition which closed earlier this month. These transactions are expected to modestly increase our adjusted R&D expense, and increase our net interest expense within our other adjusted income\/deducts line resulting in an anticipated $0.04 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS.","Importantly, our guidance update absorbs the anticipated net impact of various other drivers, some of which are expected to have a favorable impact on our financial results offset by other drivers that negatively impact our outlook for 2019.","On the favorable side, we now expect greater contributions in 2019 from certain biopharma products, primarily within our Oncology and internal medicine businesses than we previously anticipated, and our Upjohn business benefited from the delayed entry of generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. which is expected to begin on July 1 but did not start until July 19. However, we expect this operational upside to our forecast to be offset by foreign exchange, and other recent product developments for Prevnar and Xeljanz.","On foreign exchange, we had originally anticipated in January that FX would have an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately $900 million and $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS compared to foreign exchange rates from 2018. We now anticipate that foreign exchange will have a $1.2 billion unfavorable impact on revenue and $0.08 on adjusted diluted EPS for the year based on actual exchange rates in the first half of the year and mid-July FX rates for the remainder of 2019.","So foreign exchange is expected to have an incremental negative impact of approximately $350 million on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to our January guidance. On an operational basis the ACIP's provisional recommendation to the pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for Prevnar 13 in adults in the U.S. as well as the recent revision of the Xeljanz U.S. prescribing information have negatively impacted our outlook for both products for the remainder of 2019.","In summary, our guidance update slowly reflects pending business development activity and absorbs the various operational puts and takes that we have seen so far this year as well as the incremental negative impact of foreign exchange. Finally, as a reminder, our financial guidance for adjusted diluted EPS reflects share repurchases totaling $8.9 billion completed in the first quarter, which we expect will be offset by about half from dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered solid financial results with 2% operational revenue growth, 4% adjusted diluted EPS growth and 6% operational revenue growth in our Biopharmaceuticals Group compared with the year-ago quarter. This keeps us on track to deliver solid financial performance in 2019. We updated our 2019 financial guidance based on the anticipated near-term completions of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the Array BioPharma acquisition and the completed Therachon acquisition. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $12.9 billion to shareholders during the first half of 2019 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Good. Thank you, Frank and Albert. And sorry about the technical glitch. Evidently, we didn't have unlimited talk time on our calling plan, I would guess. But with that, let's turn it to start the Q&A.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have two. It looks like 2020 pro forma EPS for Pfizer alone could be about $2.10. Is that a reasonable estimate at this juncture? So that's the first question. Second Albert, you had been steadfast that a major transaction was unlikely while Pfizer was in the midst of several important launches. I'm just wondering, what changed and what does this tell us about the outlook for the new products \u2013 thank you \u2013 meaning the Upjohn transaction? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","All right. Let me cover this one, and then I will ask Frank to comment on the EPS. And frankly, nothing has \u2013 we always said that the internal separation of Upjohn was a significant theme in the value creation thesis when we announced it's great. I mean, Upjohn has a significant business model. They remain in Pfizer. And the substantial autonomy was essential for its success. That was always the thesis. And we said that, we will not explore options before we spend after this business, because we want to focus right now on spending up this business. But I have to tell you that we substantially completed the internal Upjohn organization separation earlier this month. That involves multiple things including legal entities. We have a new organization but it is already operational worldwide. It is fully staffed. The Shanghai headquarters is already up and running. And the business it performed according to our expectations actually a little bit better.","So we always look of course to maximize value of the business. When we assessed the potential of combining these two companies, we quickly saw the potential to create value for shareholders in excess of what could be created if the businesses will remain as such. Now, that doesn't create any disruption to our main biopharmaceutical business because it's already separate business, but continues to operate as separate business as it does. It's going to have a little bit of disruption in Upjohn as we integrate, but all of that we took into consideration when we saw how much bigger value we can create for our shareholders by combining those two businesses. Frank, on the EPS?","Frank D'Amelio","So Steve, what we did is we gave some -- I'll call it preliminary financial numbers for 2020. We covered revenue. We covered EBT as a percentage of revenue operating cash flow and we obviously made some comments about -- I made some comments about the dividend. We did that obviously to be helpful. In terms of specific EPS numbers, we'll do what we typically do which is we'll provide EPS guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call as we've done in prior years.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. If I could just go back to split. So splitting up first contemplated in early 2011, then in 2017 you guys kind of called it off. And one of the reasons for that was the valuation and spec pharma went down. That was kind of viewed as the comp for established products. And I think on a sum of the parts basis you guys are worried you wouldn't unlock value.","So if I fast-forward to where we are today spec pharma multiples have gone even lower. That's going to be some variation if that's going to be what's applied to the Upjohn business. So that part of the problem hasn't really gotten any better. And I'm wondering kind of what changed in your viewpoint from -- impediment to today where apparently it's not. So that's the first question.","Second question is just the emerging markets part of Upjohn I think is about $4 billion or 40% of total Upjohn revenues. Does this disrupt the corporate footprint in emerging markets that was a pretty sizable business that's a scale business as well? And was there any contemplation on keeping the emerging market part within the parent Pfizer company?","Albert Bourla","Yes. Thank you, Tim. Look as you said the scenario split in the company was put to bed earlier on. And that scenario was mainly a scenario to take advantage of the multiples at the time so it was kind of a financial engineering. But it didn't work and will not work in Pfizer. This is why we moved away from this strategy.","What we tried to do is to create operational value, value that is creating by putting similar things together. And the first step we did was to create Upjohn because Upjohn had very different characteristics from the previous established products. It was basically carefully selected assets that was trying to get advantage of the very positive demographics that were happening in Asia and particularly in China in terms of the types of volume creation. And that was something that we completed internally and we always knew that autonomous operation having them run almost like a company within a company was going to create value. So that's the first step","But when we assessed the complementarity of the Upjohn business together with Mylan we understood that then we can create a substantially better bigger company. So this is the reason why we said that Upjohn instead of keeping it inside which is very different than the established products it in all aspects very different portfolio very different size, very different everything is now going to create significant value by putting together with Mylan.","Now as regards the emerging markets not at all. Let's start with China and then I will take it to the emerging markets in general. Upjohn -- let's start with Upjohn. As part of the new company now we have a strong pipeline we didn't have before and they'll have a strong pipeline to put through the great commercial infrastructure in China to fuel the growth.","Now let\u2019s see China? The remaining -- the Biopharmaceutical Pfizer's presence in China. The remaining Pfizer it is almost half of the $5 billion that we have right now in China. So the size will be significant. And then you can see the growth prospects of this business is growing 26% in the second quarter. So it's doing very well. But we are even more excited about the futures growth of this business. We maintain all our R&D and free force capabilities in China, by the way all of that are completely segregated right now. And in addition -- with Upjohn I mean -- and in addition we are expecting to file up to 19 new products in the next few years in China. So that's very significant.","Now let's move to in general the emerging markets in the remaining. The size of emerging markets currently in the Biopharmaceutical businesses is almost 20% of the total business. And if you see the growth trajectory of this business is growing almost triple the rate than the remaining of the Biopharmaceutical business. So with this transaction we do not reduce the scale or the growth prospects at all of the main Pfizer into emerging markets.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thank you, Albert of that. Move to our next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for the Biopharma business you guided to five year growth rate at the high end of mid-single digits. So just wondering any meaningful differences there in your projections versus consensus? And then Albert would welcome any additional perspective on the proposed Senate drug pricing legislation and maybe your Part D exposure on a pro forma basis? Thanks.","Albert Bourla","Yes. Thank you very much and very good questions. First of all, on the first we never comment on other people's projections. I know that this is your job to do projections, but we have our internal. So Frank, you want to make a comment ","Frank D'Amelio","Sure.","Albert Bourla","\u2026on that and then I will take the second question.","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So I can comment on the revenue and obviously to Albert's point we'll talk about our numbers -- I'll talk about our numbers. So from my perspective the 5-year CAGR -- revenue growth CAGR will improve. We've said previously mid-single digits. Now we're saying high mid-single digits. We'll see the growth faster. The reason we'll see the growth faster is immediately upon close Lyrica LOE goes to Upjohn so we won't have that. We believe the growth will be more sustainable because it's on a smaller base. And then most importantly, we will leverage that growth to the bottom-line as we always do. So that's how we think about the revenue.","Albert Bourla","Yes. So let me make some comments about the Senate. As you know, last week there was a markup in the Senate Finance Committee. We cannot support this bill as written and it's not only us but in general the pharma has expressed their frustration. Obviously, there are some provisions of the proposed bill that we do support and we believe will help lower spending on prescription drugs. And -- such as instituting out-of-pocket caps for patients or improving incentives for biosimilars utilization. These are very positive things in the bill.","However, we believe that none of these in -- for none of these the bill goes far enough. We would expect that they would do much more to incentivize biosimilars and we would expect that they could do much more to create relief on patients.","Also the bill while it generates savings for the health care system, it does it with punitive measures for the industry and does not distribute the savings to patients. And thus does very little to fix the issue as a result of high out-of-pocket costs for them. This is the fundamental issue right now in the political life and this is the fundamental issue of the pharmaceuticals business. More there -- on that needs to be addressed.","Now we are working very productively with the administration and we are working very productively with senators and we plan to do it with also -- to continue to make it with Senator Grassley and Wyland and Senate members from both sides of the aisle to see how we can improve this proposal. And also we noted that in the Senate bill there was the unanimous support -- almost unanimous support to introduce a comprehensive rebate reform into this bill. This is very, very positive and I believe that will be one of the very meaningful tools that the Senate Committee has in their hands to reduce out-of-pocket costs.","Now as regards what will be the size of the impact it's very early to calculate because our experience is that typically these things are changing dramatically between markup and then what comes to the floor and then eventually what is becoming a bill. So I would rather stay on the basic principles that the bill is punitive for the pharma, but more importantly doesn't distribute all of the savings that is created for the patients.","Chuck Triano","Right. Thanks for the perspective, Albert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch upon a couple of things, if I may. First, as we think about the China pricing concerns, the question that I've been toying with is Lipitor and Norvasc were down 27% or so this quarter. We've seen some evidence online that the tenders in China could be as high as 70% price drop. So, is the price drop done on Lipitor and Norvasc or are we expecting more? And then, the same theme over to the antibiotics business as well, because presumably the 7 plus 4 initiative could expand to antibiotics, and your thoughts on China business as it relates to antibiotics? Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Yes. And I think Michael gave a very good overview of the situation in China in a previous call, but I can give you also a summary. I think the -- right now, the value -- the volume-based procurement will expand from 11 cities to more cities, and that will affect the price. So, I think that the prices will go down.","At the same time, we see that there is tremendous volume opportunity of going up. So, as a result, we think that eventually the business will be the base as these close to 31 cities, but there will be continued growth for the high-quality branded products, because the Chinese healthcare system, including physicians and patients, they place a lot of value in the brand equity of this drug.","So, that has been calculated in all our numbers, but were included for China, and you saw it in the previous presentation. And that will continue. By the way, our antibiotics, they are in Pfizer -- in the remaining Pfizer, they're not part of our Upjohn it's part of Sterling injectables, and they're not at QC, so they are not affected at all by that.","So far, as regard the trajectory for our business in China. From the rebates business, we think because of the volumes, after all this price hit the significant volume expansion, we will continue seeing volume growth -- revenues growth in China.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Albert. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just on the margin side of the story. As we think about high to mid-single-digit growth for the Pfizer Biopharma business, can you just elaborate on what that looks like in terms of the magnitude of margin expansion and pre-tax growth we can think about for Pfizer over time? I guess trying to get to the question here, is there areas you still need to ramp investment on that core innovative business? Or can we think about much of the top line growth over the next few years, falling largely to the bottom line?","My second question, which is coming back to Tafamidis, and just the launch dynamics on that product. Just any early color of how we should -- how you're thinking about the coming quarters, and the type of ramp that we should be thinking about as that product gets off the ground? Thanks so much.","Albert Bourla","Frank, would you like to comment how we see margins evolving in joint company?","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So Chris, I talked about in my prepared remarks, margins -- IBT margins, I talked about in the mid-30s. The reason I did that was because we're shifting income from above the line to below the line with things like the consumer joint venture, think about above other income to in other income. So, we used IBT, as I'll call it, the benchmark to use going forward as a percentage of revenues, so mid-30s.","But, we fully expect as our revenues grow for us to leverage that to the bottom line. I think we've demonstrated that over the years, we will continue to do that going forward. So, yes, as our revenues grow, we expect margin expansion to the bottom line then obviously to not only to IBT but obviously to the EPS line as well.","Chuck Triano","Yeah. Chris, I can just -- just to clarify. IBT as income before tax, I'm not sure how common that phrase is used. But for us, as operating income, plus other income and that's the IBT, that Frank's been referencing.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Chuck.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Frank. Angela, why don't you give some color on Tafamidis please?","Angela Hwang","Great, thanks. And thanks for the question, Chris. So let me share with you what we're seeing, on our side in terms of the performance of Tafamidis. We are releasing some nice positive leading indicators, for this launch. And let me walk you through sort of the funnel of patients. And how we're seeing things play out.","First of all, we have approximately 3,000 ATTR-CM patients that we've already diagnosed. And these are patients outside of the 900 that you heard Albert talk about in his opening comments, that were part of an early access program as well as clinical trial supply.","So of these 3,000, about 1,400 of them have been prescribed Vyndaqel. And of those 1,400, 500 have actually received the medicine. And so, what we have here now are about 900 patients that are in process of clearing the access and reimbursement sort of logistics via prior authorizations that will then ultimately enable them to get the prescription.","And so I also would maybe like to mention that, so far, we're seeing the prior authorization process improve pretty much on a daily basis. And only 16 patients, 1-6, have received some sort of rejection. And even those rejections could simply be just due to documentation purposes.","So hopefully that lays out for you, where the patient flow is coming from. And how we're seeing patients get onto the drug. But also say that, we're very pleased with what we've seen so far. And what we're seeing both in terms of diagnosis as well as the process for patients to actually get their drug.","Chuck Triano","Great, thank you, Angela. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. A couple of questions please. First, we are living in a very active M&A environment thinking of AbbVie, Bristol, Takeda and so on and so forth. Your new structure will leave you a smaller company, but you will have the $12 billion additional cash from the Mylan transaction.","How are you thinking about deploying your balance sheet? And whether there is a need to reconfigure the recent historic stance of shying away from larger-scale, M&A? So that's the first question.","And then the second, more of a housekeeping question. Inlyta is an increasingly important drug as you called out in relation to the renal cell approvals. Do you have a crystal line patent which would take you out until 2030?","You list the basic patents in your annual report which is 25. What is your confidence that, in the fact you may be able to derive cash flows in the U.S. all the way out to 2030 using that second patent? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much, Andrew. Let me make a comment on BT, and then, I will ask Frank to comment on the capital structure of the new company. And then Angela you will answer the Inlyta.","So, as I said before, nothing is changing with this deal, in the way that we see business development for Pfizer going forward. You will see Pfizer to be active in BD continues to be active in BD.","And as we have said, preferably that will be on bolt-on opportunities, that would be on early to mid-stage opportunities, where maybe there is higher risk as you know, but the value creation is further greater. And the risk of operational disruption is perhaps lower.","So, we have this philosophy before and continue having it. Regarding large-scale M&A, as we said, we'll never say never and -- but right now the opportunity we have to advance our pipeline is unique. And I still do not see the need to do a large deal right now, because that can only create disruptions.","With that, I would like to ask Frank to give a more general overview on the capital structure.","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So, Andrew, you mentioned the $12 billion of cash that we're going to receive from the transaction. Our intention is to pay down debt with that $12 billion of cash. That solidifies what's already a really strong balance sheet.","We continue to have -- we expect to continue to have a solid credit rating. And then as you mentioned, we'll also generate $11 billion to $12 billion in operating cash flow post-close.","Obviously, from that we will pay the dividend. And we said we will keep our shareholders whole on the dividend. We get the importance of the dividend. Obviously, CapEx investing in the business and then the remainder will be looking at relative to share repurchases and to business development.","Chuck Triano","Angela, do you want to comment on the patent?","Angela Hwang","Sure, just quickly. Our main composition of matter patent takes us up to 2025. But of course, because of the value of the product we will continue to pursue other patents. And so, we'll see and to be determined where that takes us.","Chuck Triano","Okay. Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just coming back to the top line growth target of high mid-single-digits, could you just walk us through your assumptions?","Does that include the success -- clinical success for Ibrance adjuvant as well as status quo in the pneumococcal vaccine space? And then your comment on, Vyndaqel the 3,000 patients, so I think that's about 1,400 additional patients versus what were out there maybe diagnosed and on dexlinosol.","Is that I mean sort of you're already seeing the impact of cardiologist testing and diagnosing TTR cardiomyopathy? Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that increase in the diagnosed and treated patient pool?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Jason. Let me first clear the question about what's included in our projections of high end of mid-single-digit growth. And the way we always do it, it is with risk adjustment. There is nothing that is fully baked in.","We have a very big pipeline. And we have particularly a very big Phase III portfolio. And all of them they are appropriately risk-adjusted, so there's nothing that it is assumed a success over there or failure per se.","The fact that, we have the risks spread in many, many assets. Because, as you know we have submitted everything in time, this is what gives us a lot of confidence, that the risk adjustments are accurate.","With that I will ask Angela to comment.","Angela Hwang","On the diagnosis, so what we're seeing from a diagnosis perspective and what's helping us are the following: I think first of all, we're seeing some good use of PYP scintigraphy, which is the non-invasive method for identifying and diagnosing ATTR-CM and a good -- a high utilization of that as a non-invasive mechanism.","But also in terms of where the diagnoses coming from, we're seeing a good spread between the centers of excellence, between specialty cardiology, as well as general cardiology. So I think that the education efforts that we have ongoing about the signs and symptoms of ATTR-CM has as creates suspicion around them. It's happening across all different aspects of cardiology, whether it's in academic centers or in the community. And I think that this is why I was saying that we have some really positive leading indicators of this launch and it's going according to plan.","Albert Bourla","Great. Thank you very much, Angela. Next question please operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is as you trim down to these core assets that higher end of the mid single-digit range, is that organic growth or does that include M&A? And then I wanted to ask you also on Array. The Anchor CRC and the Adjuvant setting how do you think about those opportunities in light of the BEACON data that you've seen so far?","And then my last question is on your DMD product. Do some of the safety issues that came up in your Phase 1 study change your view about the market opportunity? What doses of the hospitalizations occur and was it due to promoter or AAV9? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very, very much Louise. Let me first take out of the way the first one which is an easy. We do not include any M&A in our projections. When we speak about high end of mid single-digit growth, we mean organically. Now Mikael, can you please comment on Array and DMD?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. So on Array, we are very excited about overall opportunity for the team. And as you know recently in May, there was communicated both very convincing updated data from the Columbus melanoma trial. The data from the second and third-line BEACON trial, which was received I think extremely well about the strong data including survival response rate of the triplet.","We're pleased that our additional trials such as the Anchor trials that served as a first trial for first-line BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC and additional trials are flours and foros [ph], fluorescence is in BRAF-mutant melanoma, foros is in BRAF-mutant lung cancer. And we've earlier stated that we've seen opportunity actually to consider extend that to normal tissue-agnostic opportunity for BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI. So overall we see this as a very strong platform.","As you know the Array also has a large number of partner program that will continue to advance in development and grow as products that provide a third leg of future opportunity, plus R&D engine that will be added to our pipeline pending close of the deal.","On the DMD, we presented at the parent project muscular dystrophy conference recently an update of our trial. And we continue to be optimistic about the field in general and as well looking at our aggregator safety data as well as data on muscle fiber distribution mini-dystrophin concentration and the early data we reported on NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment and creatine kinase as a muscle health marker.","We think the integrated data set are sufficiently encouraging to support the continued development of the investigational therapy. And as Albert alluded to in his introductory remarks our manufacturing including large-scale 2,000-liter bioprocessors are on track, as we continue the trial to support a potential pivotal study June next year.","Albert Bourla","Great. Thank you so much answering Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger ","Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, could you please comment on the innovative business in China excluding Upjohn? What is your revenue run rate in China excluding Upjohn?","Second, with respect to Ibrance adjuvant readouts, could you please update us on the timing?","And then third, with respect to U.S. biosimilars, could you update us on the expected launches in coming months? And if you have any specific timing that would be helpful. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much. I will cover the innovative business in China, and then I will ask Angela to cover biosimilars and the question about Ibrance. Our innovative business in China, it is approximately in the first half of the year half the size of the business. So it is in the north of $2 billion I think for the full year. If you extrapolate it is around $5 billion.","The business is extremely healthy. It's growing right now 26% in this quarter and the growth we expect to maintain or accelerate. We are maintaining the capabilities of the innovative business compared to the capabilities of the Upjohn have been already segregated at once. There's very little connectivity, which is mainly in enabling function systems, et cetera, but in terms of marketing, management, research and development, manufacturing all of that are already separated.","The Biopharmaceutical business has many more resources than the Upjohn, because it's a much more demanding business, and we plan to maintain them all. And you need to know that we have a very strong research organization in China, but also we plan to maintain and enhance.","As regards to the outlook of this business in China, we plan to launch approximately to introduce 19 new products in the next few years. So, let me take it back to Angela and also Angela if you want to make some comments about the innovative business in China, feel free, but also cover the biosimilars and the Ibrance question.","Angela Hwang","Sure. Sure. So, just to follow what Albert was saying, we have a strong portfolio of innovative products in China. In 2018, we have -- we saw the other listings on the NRDL of very important Oncology products. And in this year 2019, we are continuing to look forward to driving growth through the continued listing of other notable products such as Ibrance and Xeljanz, which is coming up in 2019. So, hope that just gives you a flavor of the types of launch activities that we're looking forward to and what we see as the drivers of growth.","To your second question, which I think was about Ibrance adjuvant, those -- in that regard, we're looking forward to the two trials PENELOPE as well as PALLAS, both in the high-risk early breast cancer patients. Both of these trials, if successful will allow us to double the number of patients that we can put on Ibrance. And because these are event-driven trials, I think we've spoken about these before, we expect to report to you when the recruitment and when the numbers of patients have been finalized. But that looks like approximately sort of middle of the year next year is what we're anticipating, so more to come on that one.","And then your final question was about -- yes, biosimilars. So, as you can see to-date, all three of our monoclonal antibody biosimilars have now been approved by the FDA. So we're really pleased with that. That's a major regulatory milestone that we have accomplished. And now, we look forward to the launches. That will be coming up in short order. I don't -- I can't really give you exact dates, because as you know, there's just many things that go -- or many considerations that get factored into when a biosimilar can get launched. But I think that commensurate with the successes we've seen in these approvals, we are very much gearing up and looking forward to the launches coming up soon.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thanks Angela. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris","Hi, just a simple one. The opioid litigation, can you give us an update on whether or not the opioid products are going with the Upjohn business or are they remaining with Pfizer? Thank you.","Doug Lankler","Yes. So it's Doug Lankler. Thanks for the question. So, Upjohn has no opioid liabilities, so -- and Pfizer has a very, very small amount of them as well. But Upjohn doesn't have any, so nothing will be going in the opioid area to the new business.","Chuck Triano","Okay. Great. Thanks Doug. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mani Foroohar from SBC Leerink.","Mani Foroohar","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little more detail on tafamidis' and I have a follow-up after that. You've commented on 500 commercial patients, 900 on compassionate use in clinical trial, which would imply an incremental 1,600 patients outside of those two buckets to get to the 3,000 number of diagnoses that you've hopefully given to us. My question is the breakout of that population. Of the 500 commercial patients are zero or some other number from the -- of the EAP. If zero of the patient -- if zero EAP patients are in that 500 commercial, are all 400 of the EAP patients that were on EAP in December 2018 in the 900 population you disclosed today, if all 400 of those EAP patients are in that 900, when if ever will they get -- will they become commercial patients generating revenue? And then beyond that for the other 1,600 diagnosed patients, but not yet in either those two buckets, can we think about time...","Albert Bourla","I think we lost Mani.","Operator","Your next question will come from Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst.","Albert Bourla","Before we do that, I know we lost Mani, but let me ask Angela to answer at least the part of the question that we were able to listen to.","Angela Hwang","Okay. Great. So, just to pick up on the numbers, the 1,400 patients -- commercial patients that I referred that have been prescribed tafamidis have nothing to do with the early access program. So, the early access program has 700 patients. And of those 700 patients, 25 have already been transitioned over into commercial, but I'm not counting that as part of the 500. So that's a separate stream. So, if you think just purely newly diagnosed commercial patients who came on Vyndaqel for the first time as commercial patients that's the 500.","There's a different stream that we need to follow for the 700 early access program getting commercialized or getting moved into commercial product. And like I said, there's 25 of those. And that's a different process that we have to work through with our clinical trial size in order to transition them, so that's they move at a slightly different pace with a different process, but we anticipate that over the next several months, all of these patients will need to be moved over.","Albert Bourla","Great. Thank you. Angela.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Angela. Next question? If we can take our last question please, operator.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst.","Navin Jacob","Hi, sorry, Navin from UBS. Thanks for taking my question. On tafamidis -- sorry if I missed this, but Angela, is there's any color around how much usage you're getting in sort of the pure cardiomyopathy market versus any usage in the mixed phenotype market that would be great. And then just on Xeljanz, any color on just given the label change, how you're now sort of thinking about the UC market opportunity, any color on peak outlook there would be helpful? Thank you.","Angela Hwang","Sure. So as you can tell, we have 500 patients that have received drug even though we've diagnosed a great deal more. So at this point it's a little difficult because we don't have enough numbers to be able to be exact with you in terms of how many are the hereditary type and how many are the wild type.","But just order of magnitude of all the ATTR-CM patients that exist 90% of them are going to be wild type, meaning very little are hereditary. So I would anticipate that as we are diagnosing these patients that that distribution would apply. But I don't have definitive numbers on that quite yet.","In terms of UC, so here how we're looking at it, which is that if we look at how our UC scripts are being generated today, most of them are coming from second line use, a second line after anti-TNF. So where the new label is going is in fact where -- that's in fact how our business is operating today. A large majority of our patients are our second line after anti-TNF.","So I think that this is one where we're going to have to monitor. I think as you can imagine that there is just an incredible and a significant education effort that needs to go on now with our physicians. And I think as a result of that education method we'll get a better feel of how they are looking at UC second line. But certainly this is very much aligned with how we're doing business today anyway.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much Angela. And let me make some final comments to give the highlights of the business and I want to see it from the Pfizer shareholders as well what the Pfizer shareholder is receiving.","So first of all, our shareholders will receive 57% of a new created company. The new company will be stronger will have a great scale, great diversification, great R&D and much more focused. And, of course, it will have a great capital structure. We believe that Mylan's equity is right now significantly undervalued.","Five months ago their stock was $32, which is more than $73 than were Friday's close. We have done a lot of due diligence as a responsibility for our shareholders and we feel comfortable with what we have seen.","We do not believe the issues were related to the underlying business of the undervaluation of their stock. In fact, we discovered they have done a very good job with their pipeline and they have diversified the result -- their business. Also discovered that they have a very credible cost to control -- their cost.","They soon were related to uncertainties around strategic direction around governance, around shareholder friendliness, and to believe that this transaction checks all boxes. This results in a materially less leverage company, robust cash flows, which facilitates payment of an attractive dividend, redomeciles company back to the U.S. in the most shareholder friendly jurisdiction, which is Delaware. And we do that with no meaningful dissynergy impacts. So there will be no tax dissynergies. And, of course, we have a strong performing governance.","Now this is what our shareholders received from us. In addition they will receive a 57% on the value of synergies of this combination will create, and of course they will receive $12 billion in cash.","But what is more important for our shareholders, it is what -- how the remaining company Pfizer will look like. The company will be singularly focused on innovative biopharma with valuable growth assets in a strong pipeline.","Our product portfolio and pipeline will more easily move the needle in terms of growth impact given the smaller size, which will also make the growth more sustainable.","We anticipate remaining Pfizer's revenue CAGR on a five-year basis will improve to the high end of mid-single-digit and this will happen the moment that we close the transaction.","We also as I said believe that the growth will be much more sustainable, given the small size and given the fact that the size goes down but all the growth assets and all the R&D remains in the main company.","And finally we will continue, of course, to have a very strong balance sheet with a solid credit rating. We believe that when you see this transaction in the context of the previous three -- actually all transactions are closing in this week or next week, which is the Therachon acquisition, we expect to close very soon the Array acquisition, we expect to close very soon the formation of the JV and we announced today this create a very different Pfizer that will be in the leadership of growth profile in top and much more bottom line. So thank you for all your questions and have a nice afternoon.","Chuck Triano","Thank you everybody. This will conclude our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16792":["Pfizer Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2018 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Albert Bourla, our Chief Operating Officer, Frank D'Amelio; our CFO; Mikael Dolston, President of Worldwide Research and Development; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com\/investors.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the original date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Form 8-K dated today, July 31, 2018.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making within each of our businesses, the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline and some of the steps we are taking to prepare the company to accelerate top line growth in the future.","In the second, quarter total company revenues were up 2% operationally, driven by the continued growth of key brands, biosimilars and emerging markets. These growth drivers were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a decline in U.S. legacy-established products and product supply shortages related to our legacy Hospira products.","I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 5% operationally thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines. In the second quarter, global Ibrance revenues were up 19% operationally to just over $1 billion. This was driven by strong growth in international developed markets which represents our next avenue of growth potential for the brand. And to a lesser extent, in emerging markets and the U.S., Ibrance continues to hold a leadership position in first-line hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Since its launch, approximately 12,000 physicians have prescribed Ibrance in the U.S. and more than 140,000 patients have been prescribed the medicine worldwide.","The overall CDK class continues to grow within the eligible patient population, although penetration has decelerated to approximately 64% of eligible first-line newly started patients in the U.S. receiving CDK therapy. Within the CDK category, which now includes two competitors, Ibrance total prescription share is 91%.","Xtandi's U.S. alliance revenue grew 21% to $171 million. We received good news earlier this month when the U.S. FDA approved a supplementary new drug application for Xtandi based on results from the Phase 3 PROSPER trial. The approval broadens the indication for Xtandi to now include men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This makes Xtandi the first and only oral medication that is FDA approved for both non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC and the anticipated approval of this indication was a key factor in our evaluation of Medivation.","Xeljanz continues its strong performance, with revenues increasing 37% operationally in the quarter to $463 million. We received several additional regulatory milestones since our last call. In May, the FDA approved Xeljanz for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Days earlier, it was also approved in Japan for the same indication. In June, the European Commission approved Xeljanz in combination with Methotrexate for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients.","In addition, we recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe recommending marketing authorization for Xeljanz for adult patients with ulcerative colitis, and we look forward to the potential approval of this indication. For a broad array of indications, ease-of-use and a good tolerability profile, we see Xeljanz increasingly becoming a go-to product with rheumatologists and GI physicians.","Worldwide, Pfizer's revenue for Eliquis were up 42% operationally to $889 million, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and the EU. In the U.S., Eliquis now makes up more than half of novel oral anticoagulant prescriptions, widening its market share lead in the quarter from 10% to 13 percentage points ahead of our primary competitors.","Finally, we continue to review strategic options for our Consumer Healthcare business, which delivered another solid quarter.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. We once again saw strong operational growth in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. Overall Essential Health revenues for the quarter declined however, due in large part to the ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, continuing product LOEs, namely Lyrica in developed Europe and a decline in the legacy established products portfolio in developed markets.","Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 10% operationally for the quarter to nearly $2 billion. China led the way, growing 24% operationally. Revenues from our biosimilars business grew 44% operationally in the quarter to $188 million. Our growth in biosimilars was driven primarily by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. as well as in developed Europe. We expect to broaden our biosimilars portfolio in the U.S. by potentially bringing five biosimilars to the market in the next two years.","In our sterile injectables business, as stated in first quarter earnings, we expect to see improvements in the year-over-year comparisons during the third and fourth quarter. We continue to strengthen and advance our pipeline, which we believe has the largest and most promising array of late-stage prospects it is had in decades.","Let me touch on some of our more promising recent developments. In rare diseases, following the positive top-line results from our Phase 3 study in patients with TTR cardiomyopathy, tafamidis received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. FDA and a similar designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We see this as a potentially highly important break for these patients and we look forward to presenting the full study results in August at the European Society of Cardiology conference.","In internal medicine, on July 18 we, along with our partner Eli Lilly, announced that a Phase 3 study evaluating subcutaneous administration of our investigational humanized monoclonal antibody tanezumab in patients with arthritis pain met all three co-primary endpoints. This study was a 16-week dose titration study evaluating tanezumab for the treatment of osteo pain. If approved, tanezumab would be the first in a new class of non-opioid treatments for this disease.","In oncology we currently have four potential medicines under priority review at the FDA, lorlatinib, dacomitinib, talazoparib, and glasdegib.","In inflammation and immunology, we have built what we believe is a true leadership position with our JAK franchise and currently have 10 ongoing selective immunokinase programs. We are continuing to recruit for our Phase 3 study for our JAK1 molecule in atopic dermatitis, for which we received a breakthrough designation by the FDA. We initiated a Phase 3 study of our own Xeljanz, our first JAK inhibitor in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. We initiated a Phase 1 study of a topical agent in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, and later this year we expect to share progress in our next generation JAK assets that has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for alopecia areata, a disease for which there is no approved preventive therapy or cure.","In vaccines we achieved proof of concept for our next generation multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate with the potential to cover 20 serotypes, and we are currently planning our Phase 3 program. We have currently three gene therapy programs in clinical studies, the Factor IX collaborative program with Spark Therapeutics has started to enroll patients for Phase 3. This marks the first gene therapy Phase 3 program that Pfizer has initiated, and this remains an area of high interest to us. Our gene therapy program for Duchenne's muscular disease has started dosing. The first few patients in a Phase 1\/2 trial and our collaboration with Sangamo is advancing the Phase 1\/2 dose escalation study cohort.","Through 2022, we continue to see the potential for approximately 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters subject to some expected attrition. The previously referenced approvals for Xeljanz and Xtandi represent the first two of these 15.","Before I close, let me briefly recap the announcement we made on July 11 regarding the modifications we'll be making to our structure. Effective at the beginning of the company's 2019 fiscal year, Pfizer will have three businesses, a science-based innovative medicines business, which will now include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables, an off-patent branded and generic established medicines business operating with substantial autonomy, and a Consumer Healthcare business. This new structure represents a natural evolution for our business as we transition to a period post 2020 were we expect a higher and more sustained revenue growth profile. And given the growing importance of emerging markets to Pfizer's business, we see this new structure better positioning each business to accelerate its growth.","In summary, we continue to deliver on our strategy and believe we remain well positioned to deliver new medicines for patients, enhance shareholder value and prepare the company for accelerating growth in the future. Our in-market products remain strong. Our late-stage pipeline contains several potential blockbusters. We remain prudent with regard to capital allocation, and our engagement with policymakers around the world continues to focus on creating an environment that maximizes a benefit for both innovators and patients.","It's our job not only to discover and develop medicines and vaccines, but also to advocate for affordable access so they can help the maximum number of people who need them. As such, we will continue to work with the president on his blueprint for strengthening the healthcare system, providing more access and relieving the burden on patients at the point-of-sale.","Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our revised financial outlook for 2018.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2018 revenues were approximately $13.5 billion, which includes the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $377 million and operational growth of $194 million.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 5% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2018, driven primarily by Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz globally, Prevnar 13 primarily in emerging markets and the U.S., and Xtandi in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December of 2017 and Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition. I want to remind everyone that Viagra revenues generated in the U.S. and Canada shifted to the Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018.","Revenues for our Essential Health business in the second quarter decreased 4% operationally, primarily due to a 12% operational decline in legacy established products portfolio in developed markets; a 17% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.; an 11% operational decrease in peri-LOE products in developed markets, primarily due to the expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe, all of which were partially offset by the inclusion of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada; 10% operational growth in emerging markets, reflecting growth across all portfolios; and 44% operational growth in biosimilars, mainly driven by Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S. and in developed Europe.","Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.65 compared with $0.51 in the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher other income, due to unrealized net gains on equity securities reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018; increased income from collaborations; out-licensing arrangements in the sale of asset rights; and lower charges for certain legal matters; as well as a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA in late 2017; increased revenues and foreign exchange impacts; and fewer shares outstanding, all of which were partially offset by higher cost of sales.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.81 versus $0.67 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned factors. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 85 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of shares that were repurchased during the first quarter 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter 2018 revenues by approximately $377 million and negatively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $228 million. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted second quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 versus the year-ago quarter.","We updated the following components of our 2018 financial guidance. Revenue guidance was updated solely to reflect recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates from mid April of 2018 to mid July of 2018. The adjusted R&D expenses guidance range was updated to reflect higher spend than previously anticipated in the second half of 2018 due to our late-stage development programs.","Adjusted income in the first half of 2018, which was much higher than one half of our previous full-year expectation for this component due to nonrecurring items; consequently we updated our guidance primarily to include unrealized net gains on equity securities and one-time items such as milestone payments from certain collaborations and out-licensing arrangements, and the gain on the sale of certain asset rights in the first half of 2018.","The effective tax rate on adjusted income guidance was updated to reflect the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While this estimate will continue to be subject to further analysis, interpretation, clarification of the TCJA, we believe that this revised guidance will be sustainable beyond 2018.","As a result of these updated components, we are raising our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.95 to $3.05, the midpoint of which implies 13% growth compared with 2017.","I want to point out that our 2018 financial guidance assumes no additional share repurchases. To date in 2018, we repurchased $6.1 billion of our shares. We expect the dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs to offset the reduction in shares associated with these share repurchases by approximately half. Finally, as of July 31 of 2018, we have $10.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.","Moving onto key takeaways, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of 2018 with 2% operational revenue growth and a 21% increase in adjusted diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. We increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, but we also lowered the midpoint of 2018 revenue guidance range solely to reflect recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.","We announced plans to begin operating under a new business structure beginning in 2019 and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. We returned $10.1 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank and Ian, for those comments. Operator, if we could please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, folks. I'll ask two. I want to start with a pipeline question on tafamidis, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Can you talk about the potential for that asset in light of the low diagnosis rates there and what you plan to do to build that market?","And then a bigger-picture strategic question, Ian and team, I'd like to better understand the decision you've made to reorganize the way you decided on and want to better understand whether it's tied to Albert digging in as COO and making decisions based on operational factors? Is it a realization that biosimilars will look more like brands than generics? Just some more color on what the new structure will achieve that the current one does not would be helpful. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Albert would you like to discuss tafamidis? I think it's a name that you'll very soon remember very clearly as you see its impact on patients. But Albert can talk to tafamidis. I'll make some opening comments on the reorganization and then Albert, continue to explain the reorganization. Thank you.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian, and thank you for your question, Gregg. Tafamidis is a medicine that met its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistical significant reduction, but also meaningful clinical reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular related events. This is for a disease that it is rare, but it is rare because it's significantly underdiagnosed. Right now it is expected that less than 1% of the people suffering from this disease are diagnosed actually, and a big role in that plays the fact that, until now, there was no efficient treatment.","We believe that the prevalence, which is unknown, it is quite large actually, and with a product that we're going to present the results in August in the congress in Munich, that offers significant treatment options. This market could become really large. Our efforts will focus on explaining to physicians about the treatment option but also helping them understand better the disease and increase the diagnosis rates. So more to be said after the August conference in Munich when we will announce the results.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. So, Gregg, on the restructuring, this is something that Albert as Chief Operating Officer was reviewing in that role, discussed extensively with me. It basically represents I think a pivot in the company towards growth as we see the strength of our pipeline, the need to invest in our pipeline and the need to structure around growth drivers, certainly emphasized by the fact that the optionality construct, as we said the first quarter, we no longer saw as viable. So with that, I'd like Albert to explain a little bit why we are structured around growth and why this is good for the company.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Ian, and as Ian said, the previous decision not to separate PA agent, PA testing dependent corporations but also with the comprehensive U.S. tax reform now in place, and more importantly with an increased confidence in our pipeline, now the growth is in sight in combination with the lack of LOEs. So as Ian said, we decided to organize our businesses from the base of growth drivers which will provide better operational ability to manage this business.","So a few words about those three segments. The first one, it is the cost segment of Pfizer, it's the fundamental 80% of our business and this is a science-based innovative medicines business. The fundamentals of growth in this area are very, very strong because we have an aging population, but it is increasing the demand for innovative medicines, but also science is in a position to deliver solutions right now. Frankly, Pfizer is a position to deliver strong solutions. We have made very public our release of 15 blockbusters that are expected to get registered in the next five years. So the fundamentals of growth are very strong.","In addition to the five already existing business units, we added biosimilars under oncology and I&I and immunology. The reason is that first of all this is, as the rest of the business is, high risk, high reward, heavy in R&D investments business, the biosimilars, but even more importantly right now all of our biosimilars are either registered or about to be registered in the next 12 months, which means that they are all entering commercialization phase. By placing them under the oncology and immunology businesses, that both of them, they have very strong expertise in the commercial, in the scientific and in patient experience domains, we expect that the commercialization of these products will be very strong.","The same comes with the hospital business unit that we are creating, putting underneath anti-infectives and sterile injectables. These are businesses that will grow. The sterile injectables is facing now some issues because of manufacturing supply considerations, but those will be resolved and the business will return into growth. And more, we have more than 100 research projects in this business. So that's why we created this business, to innovate.","Now if we move to the established business, the established business also had very strong fundamentals of growth, but they are very different than the researched-based high-risk high-reward innovative business. The growth drivers in this business are urbanization. The growth drivers in this business, it is a middle class that is rising, particularly Asia, and provides access to hundreds of millions of people. If you see our Chinese business, this quarter the first half of the year is growing almost 25%. This means for the size of our business that we are generating in the first half approximately $500 million. If you extrapolate, you could expect something like $1 billion of growth into a business.","Significant fundamentals. What you need to be successful in this business, it is to make sure that you have good awareness of the local markets. This is why we are placing an EOT (26:57) team member in China to be able to manage these opportunities. And you also require good autonomy, because this is a fast-moving business. This is why we are creating a company, like we are creating a division within Pfizer that will have relatively increased autonomy.","And moving to the third business, we always had the consumer business, always was operated independently. We are increasing a little bit the independence of the business, because the fundamental growth drivers has nothing to do with our prescription medicines. It has to do with the growth of consumers, of consumer consumption and it has to do with the growing element of wellness that exists in the society. And we continue examining options of course as we said for this business, and we will make our decision by the end of the year.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Albert and Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just have a couple questions. Ian, you guys have clearly been ahead of the industry in creating separate business units for reporting purposes, giving yourself optionality to spin if it made sense. And obviously it hadn't made sense, and we get that, and that's why you've decided to keep those businesses. But clearly with corporate simplification sweeping through the industry and companies clearly being rewarded for such actions, do you still feel that if conditions are right, do you believe that spinning off say the established business or the Essentials Health business is a positive, would be positive, would add value to your shareholders? Or do you believe that keeping a large company intact better serves your shareholders? That's my first question. And maybe, Albert, I'd love your take on that as well.","And then, Frank, I had asked you this question on the last earnings call, not sure. The answer was what I think we were expecting to hear, but I'm going to give you a chance to answer it again. Assuming that you don't do a large mega deal, can you still drive bottom-line leverage post 2019, post your LOEs? Your margins are around 40%. Can they get to higher than that, 43%, 44%, 45%? I think on the last earnings call you were pretty definitive in saying no, but just want to make sure you understood my time horizon, which is beyond 2019. Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Jami, thank you for the questions. So I undoubtedly believe that Pfizer has always organized itself in a way that was structurally prevalent for the market of that time and our objectives. I think this recent reorganization is around growth drivers. It does bring an element of simplification and I think it allows us to continue to evaluate our business segments to see if they're worth more inside Pfizer than outside of Pfizer. So we will continue to do that. We're very focused, have always been focused on shareholders return, not the size of the company. And so rest assured that we will, as these businesses continue to develop, look at opportunities to maximize their value. Albert do you want to add anything to that?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Ian, you said it very well and the only thing that I will say is we're always examining options for our businesses. But right now the focus, particularly in the established business, is to stand it up as a successful emerging markets-based business.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Right.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And then all options are open once we do that.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Good. Thank you. And, Frank, you want to answer Jami's beyond 2019 perspective.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. So, Jami, when I answered the question on the last call and I remember your question, I answered it for what I'll call the foreseeable future. And what I was thinking was really kind of through 2020 where we would see the impact of Lyrica, the Lyrica LOE. Beyond 2020, as we enter this period of growth, right, as we have this inflection point that we've talked about with LOEs declining materially, our in-line portfolio continuing to perform, our pipeline playing out in a positive way, then yes, we do have the ability to see leverage to the bottom line.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Jami, for the question. Can we move on to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions. The first on Ibrance and just two parts here. First, U.S. growth appears to be flattening out. I think you talked about penetration in the 60s at this point. I guess, what can you do to drive further uptake in the market? And where do you think penetration can go over time on the U.S. side? The second part of the question is on the flip side, ex-U.S., seems like it's gaining momentum here. Maybe just update in terms of where we stand for penetration on the ex-U.S. core markets.","The final question for Ian, talk a little bit more about the president's blueprint for reducing drug costs and potential changes to rebate structures. I know there's a lot of uncertainty of how this is going to play out. But how likely do you think it is that we're going to see changes to the current industry pricing structure? And how do you think about that and prepare for any changes from a Pfizer perspective? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chris. I'll let Albert discuss Ibrance and then I'll come back to your question on the evolving pricing and our market access situation in the U.S.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. And Chris, again, thanks for your question. For Ibrance we are very, very pleased with the performance. We had 19% operational growth if you compare it to last quarter, the same quarter of last year and 10% sequentially versus the first quarter of this year. And let me start by addressing the international market, and I will go to the U.S. Very, very strong performance in international markets. The sales are up almost 125% and this is driven predominantly by volume.","We had very strong uptake in all the European markets that we have launched and we have just launched in Japan and we see the same trends over there, very strong uptake of the brand. In fact, and important, I found it intriguing statistic it is that as of March, 96% of the total packs that were sold have been sold in the EU5, in the five European markets, were Ibrance. Although, over there the reimbursement didn't come with big disparities between us and competition.","Now let's move into the U.S. In the U.S. the growth was 3% sequential versus the previous quarter. So obviously we have a deceleration here of the growth. The growth deceleration has nothing to do with us losing market share. Actually, our market share remains strong, remains stable and is actually a 10% increase. The deceleration has to do with the fact that the overall CDK market is decelerating because right now the low hanging fruit has been already been harvest and what remains, it is late adopters. They need more time to be convinced to prescribe the new class.","We do believe though that the class will grow and we have strong evidence for that, the fact that when you see the overall survivor class in metastatic breast cancer, is in the 60s, as you mentioned, Chris. But if you see the new starts, it is already in the 70s, which means that we have a tendency to see over time we'll see the 60, 70. And what we do with that, we continue our D2C advertising. We continue to be able to communicate to the broad patient population about the benefits of CDK. But also we are working with currently prescribing physicians to increase usage and to increase the scripts that they progress.","So growth in the U.S. I think in the short term will come from expanding the usage or the prescription habits of physicians already prescribing. But in the midterm of course, and this is by far the biggest growth opportunity, we are expecting to come into the earlier settings with a few pivotal studies currently running, as you know.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. On the present blueprint, I mean we have submitted comments which I believe are public record. Pharma has submitted comments. Overall, we're very supportive of the blueprint. I think the president is trying to maintain a market-based system in the United States which is positive. Probably one of the largest changes, which I think would be overall positive for the industry, is the secretary's intention to remove the Safe Harbor for discounts so as to eliminate rebates.","At the moment in time, about 40% of pharmaceutical prices are subsidies to the rest of the health care system. We realize some 58% of our list price. The rest goes to subsidize profitability of PBMs, insurance companies and frankly premiums for those that are healthy. This is not a sustainable position, and so removal of the rebates I believe will be very beneficial to patients and our industry, especially those companies who are launching, those companies who are launching new products over the next five years or so.","With the removal of the rebates, we will remove the sort of what we call the rebate trap, whereby access is denied to innovative products because of a strong position of another product with its rebates. That example would be Xeljanz's slow penetration but steady into its market, given the situation of rebates of bigger competitors. I think the president is focused on improving through trade agreement the free riding that occurs on American consumers and research. He wants to promote value-driven healthcare by linking payments to performance. He's focusing on improving the efficacy of the FDA and I think that's going well so far.","And he intends to reform the 340B program, which I believe is important. This is completely distorted compared to what congress had originally intended for that program. So overall, I suppose we see more focus on net prices, rebates going away and the blueprint being implemented, which is I believe is positive for patients and positive for innovative companies.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Ian, sorry I was just listening to your answer just now. Can you just clarify, do you expect U.S. to not have a rebate system anymore? And then also on that same note, if the price increases in future are limited to low single digits, do you think that impacts your expectation for mid-single digit top-line growth for the overall company?","And a quick one on R&D if I may as well. One of the key trials for Ibrance, the PALLAS trial in adjuvant setting, can you confirm it has both low and medium risk patients along with the high-risk patients? And I ask because Novartis recently terminated a Phase 3 trial which had a hydrogenase mix of risk status across the trial. So I'm just curious if you think that introduces a layer of risk in that trial or not? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On the rebates, I do believe that the intention of the administration is to remove the Safe Harbor for rebates. Today, I would believe we're going to go to a marketplace where we don't have rebates. I don't know the speed of that, but I do believe the administration has been focused on that because that will reduce pharmaceutical prices at the point-of-sale and very positively by removing the 40% subsidy that goes to the rest of the healthcare system and putting it back on reducing pharmaceutical prices at the point-of-sale.","So we will be focusing on net price increases and you would expect them to fluctuate around healthcare inflation. As new data comes available, you may see different value equations for products that in general are around health care inflation and I don't see that as any obstacle to us growing to middle to high single digits as our growth will be coming from innovative products creating new markets. So, and as I said before, I think the removal of the rebate trap will be advantageous to Xeljanz and be advantageous to our biosimilars programs. Would you like to answer the Ibrance question please, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. With two large Phase 3 adjuvant early breast cancer trials, one is in registration, PALLAS has built intermediate and high-risk early breast cancer treatment duration up to two years. We also have the PENELOPE-B trial with high-risk adjuvant early breast cancer setting. We are very confident in our CDK and Ibrance leadership and I think the particular compelling part of Ibrance for adjuvant therapy which may be different to some other CDK is the great tolerability and the limited need for monitoring of liver EKG or difficult tolerability with G.I. So that really makes, I think, Ibrance a unique, attractive drug for a trial like PALLAS. We look forward to the outcome of that trial.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So the first one I guess is for Ian and then one on the R&D side. So for Ian, just on the new structure, I'm curious regarding business development and if this new structure in any way impacts your views around how you would pursue deals? Specifically, are you looking for deals that might be more targeted to one of the three segments? Or could a larger, overarching deal still be something of interest?","And then second question, more on the pipeline on the immunology side, you mentioned, I think you said, 10 unique programs in immunology but obviously it's a very competitive space now with a lot of players. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just frame the two or three opportunities maybe in the pipeline that you're most excited about out of all of the various kinases that you have in development and when we'll see some of the key data for those assets to help us better assess those opportunities. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Let me answer the structure as it relates to the type of deals and then Mikael will answer your questions on the pipeline, Vamil. So you know our view of BD hasn't changed much in the last couple of years. We view BD as an enabler of our strategy, not a strategy in itself, and our compass for any deal has always been generating value for Pfizer shareholders.","Specifically, at this time, regarding a large or transformative deal, I don't believe we need such a deal to drive the growth of this company. I would be and I think our leadership team is united on this view, we'd be far better off focusing on developing our pipeline, investing in our pipeline, bringing these products to market, growing these products, than undertaking a large deal. A large deal is always available to us, but the chance of developing this pipeline is unique in this moment. It requires more research, more focus and as I say, any large deal is always available to a company with our balance sheet and size.","So we would be looking at, if we were doing business development and we continue to look at the market for business development, more in single deals, things around late Phase 2, early Phase 3, something that can continue to boost our pipeline in sort of five-plus years. So that would be our focus right now. As I said, never say never, situations change, valuations change, but at this moment that is our thinking around BD and it links to this new structure with its focus on growth in all segments of the business. Mikael, would like to answer the question?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So thank you for your interest in the JAK franchise. And first, we think Pfizer is well positioned for sustained and growing leadership. We have Xeljanz now already used in three indications, RA, UC and PSA, and are conducting additional pivotal studies in ankylosing spondylitis. We have now 10 Phase 2 and 3 studies running with new generation of JAKs and five different NME JAK-related drugs in clinical studies.","For the specific examples, JAK1 is in Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis. We are very excited about the JAK1 drug class, with rapid onset of action, with strong efficacy on eczema skin clearance and pruritus, itching, which has really the potential to be differentiated from the first marketed biological in atopic dermatitis.","The second would be, we have a novel JAK that we'll present first-in-class data in alopecia areata later this fall. This has the possibility to be swiftly followed by a pivotal study, pending regulatory dialogues. This novel JAK represents a new treatment option possibility for alopecia and other autoimmune diseases with similar mechanisms such as impetigo.","And we have three different assets in rheumatology in Phase 2 studies. Readouts from those will guide future potential pivotal study design. We're also planning to expand our presence in ulcerative colitis where we have Xeljanz and are running several studies in Crohn's disease with new generation of JAKs specifically tailored for such diseases.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. Ian, since you did have an opportunity to speak with the president on pricing, did he indicate anything about the timing for implementation of the new plan on rebates? Is that something we'd see before the midterms or after the midterms?","Second question has to do with the increase in R&D investment that Mikael was able to secure. What are the programs that you're going to be allocating that several hundred million dollars behind?","And then third question has to do with gene therapy and your strategy behind your portfolio of gene therapy assets, most notably the Factor VIII\/IX program and the neuroscience program in Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy. Can you articulate what your strategy there is in gene therapy? Do you want to grow that organically or potentially do some tuck-ins around that area? And do you have the adequate manufacturing capabilities to be able to produce enough product for the areas that you've targeted? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Hey, John. Thank you for the questions. My conversations with the president were centered around his blueprint and the actions he wants to take in those blueprints. I didn't obviously \u2013 you don't get definitive dates out of an administration. But I think I would say I see a huge sense of urgency on the part of the administration to act on the rebate part of the middlemen where they see that the subsidy that pharmaceuticals is delivering to the rest of the healthcare system is unsustainable and needs to be corrected. So I expect the administration to act on that with as much urgency as they can.","With regard to the gene therapy, I mean we have made a substantial investment in manufacturing in gene therapy. The plan is, we'll come online within the next couple years, about $300 million to date. We've committed to that. We're committed to gene therapy. We have the gene therapy that Mikael had just mentioned. We would look to tuck-ins if they were available. That's part of our view on buying intellectual property that has within the next five years launch potential. And we're committed to this area and we think we have a strong franchise. We certainly are not going to buy gene therapy that we think is way overpriced, but we will buy gene therapy that we think has value.","On the U.S. R&D, I'll really ask Mikael and Albert to comment on specific programs, but I would say that most of it is focused on ensuring that those 15 products get launched and in development spend. Albert, do you want to make a comment here?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","You're exactly right and that Mikael can give more details, but we are focused on new Phase 3 starts. We are focusing on the next generation pneumococcal vaccine that it is about to start. We are focusing on JAK1 atopic dermatitis Phase 3. That has already been started. We are focusing on starting Phase 3 studies with other JAKs right now. Mikael? In gene therapy that we just spoke, we are having three clinical programs that we are scaling up right now.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","I think you said it very well. We have a growing Phase 3 registration portfolio where all areas are contributing. Indeed, the pace of pipeline today is close to 100 clinical projects, of which more than 40%, 4-0, are in Phase 3 registration, and we're geared up to deliver up to 15 blockbuster potentials over the next five years as well as preparing for the next wave of even stronger productivity going from 2023 and onward. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Okay. I'd just add to that, that we also have trials that are extremely large in the vaccine, 20, where we're entering into Phase 3, and we tend to be very competitive there and also in our vaccine for (50:31) which is \u2013 and for C. diff. Now C. diff is a large trial. We are the leader in that category. One of our competitors withdrew from developing their products. This is a significant disease burden. We need to invest. We need to make sure we get to the events and expand the cohorts. So we're putting a lot of money into vaccine trials as well.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","And many Phase 3 are coming right now, so it's a good time for R&D pipeline.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much. Ian, a follow-up on your comments on the administration's blueprint and planned changes to rebates. Obviously per your comments, under the current structure there are billions of dollars at stake and probably thousands of jobs, so there will be pushback to this. I'm just wondering, are you still confident that the administration will pursue this with urgency? And also, do you believe the changes will be limited to the government business or will it also extend to the commercial side as well?","Then a follow-up on tanezumab, if I may. You're obviously looking at rapidly progressing OA in a much more systematic way than you did in the prior trials. So given that, are you using the same definition for RPOA? And given the methodology differences, is it appropriate to compare the rates in the new trial to the prior trials? Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Look, you know, reform of systems is unpredictable. I believe that the administration is focused on rebate reform. I believe that initially their reforms will be focused on the public sector where they have the authority to take the rebates out of the Safe Harbor, but I believe that will extend to the commercial business very, very quickly as I can't really see a bifurcated system where half the system is on net price and the other is on a rebate. It's just the transparency won't allow that. So I would see rebates going away and the system accommodating itself to negotiations on value and net price. But as I said, this is a political decision, and you have one person's view and we'll have to see. But I do think it's a priority for the administration. Mikael, would you want to talk about Phase 1?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. First, I just wanted to say that we are really pleased with the readout of the recent tanezumab OA 1056 study which showed positive outcomes for tanezumab compared to placebo in all three primary, co-primary or pain physical function in patients' global assessment. And the drug was well-tolerated in general with less than 1% patient discontinuing therapy.","Now concerning rapidly progressing away, despite this, OA study was conducted in a more advanced patient population were patients have already failed other therapies. The rate of RPOA rapidly progressing away in the treatment group was less than 1.5%, which we think is a similar ballpark back run rate to what's been seen in other large OA studies.","The decent profile of tanezumab will be partly supported by the readouts next year, and overall we believe that tanezumab has the potential to offer a valuable treatment alternative for pain patients that are currently poorly managed by a variety of treatment alternatives, such as opioids and NSAIDs.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Just one question please. The culture and cost base of an optimal established product business I would imagine is very different from a business which is buried within its pharma company. To what extent do you think the restructure could realize significant improvement of the cost structures, whether it's optimizing the growth? And then beading on from that, would you be giving guidance for each of the individual business units, revenue and\/or EBIT? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","We will not be giving guidance for the individual units. We'll be giving guidance for the stock ticker of Pfizer. But I believe this is about more about getting the right focus and the right management and positioning our headquarters of this new BU or positioning the leader that's that way in China. I think it will lead to simplification, will lead to savings in our expense base. But that is not a primary motivation for doing this. It's more about getting focus of management around key sectors. Albert, would you like to add to that?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","I think you said it very well, Ian. And I would add that indeed it is different, the cost structure of a business in aggregate. It is not likely innovative, but just heavy in R&D. That business will not. But also it's not like a generic business, because this is business. It is a growing in the emerging markets business, where it has significant field force presence, and this is how we are driving our growth. And this is why I think we have a competitive advantage to be able to lead in that space, exactly because we are very well entrenched into the physicians and the prescription base of these markets.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","The only thing I would add is that it's a business where we've taken significant savings already.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And thanks, Andrew, for the question. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on your pipeline. So first on tanezumab, could you comment on what you think the approvability of your drug would be despite some of the safety concerns? And then secondly on tafamidis, just curious how you distinguish your product from others that are potentially in development. And then the last one is just on the JAKs, the alopecia areata opportunity, could you size what that market opportunity might be and what you think the right pathways are for a JAK product to deal with alopecia areata? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Why don't we have Albert talk about the size of the market for alopecia areata and then we'll have pipeline answers by Mikael.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","We think it is a significant market, because this is a market that is that it is extremely emotional for people. We've done extensive market research with patients. And one of the things that it was very indicative for me, it is in our clinical studies. We are enrolling faster than anything I have seen so far, which is an indication of how much patients they consider what a very big medical need. With that I will ask Mikael to comment on all the R&D questions.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. First on tanezumab, I'm real excited about the way forward for tanezumab supported by the positive primary endpoint that I spoke to in the doses we have selected, the convenient substitute cutaneous administration and good tolerability. Of course, all approvals are pending final readout and regulatory dialogues, but what makes me excited is that there is a real scarcity in new pain drug classes and pain patients, which has a real impact on the life quality needs new drug classes. And you are obviously aware of the challenge we have as a nation with extended and excess use of opioids. And tanezumab offers for patients that are not eligible or well tolerating or willing to take opioids, or progress on opioids, NSAIDs, are really I think attractive alternative. And we look forward to detail the benefit risk profile as all studies read out next year.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Louise, just adding to Mikael's and my detail on those comments, I do think we see the alopecia areata and the clinical indications around that mechanism of action to be a blockbuster status. So where I can do forecasts, I would consider that to be a blockbuster. And I just want to correct something on the gene therapy plant, it'll be ready to produce at industrial scale in early 2019.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. And finally on tafamidis, what is distinct in that trial, Albert alluded to earlier that we are studying the cardiomyopathy indication which has the majority of patients wild-type excess production of TTR and a smaller proportion of patients are mutant. We have recorded a really great tolerability profile and we'll share that outcome in more details of what was a positive study including all-cause mortality and severe related hospitalization. But to the very best of my knowledge, this is the only pivotal study available that have outcome data and includes the most prominent patient population, the wild-type.","To run such a study takes more than four years, so we think that tafamidis will have an opportunity pending regulatory dialogue, to be a real first-in-class drug for severe patient needs and Albert spoke to how we hope to grow the diagnostic rate and lead indication of patients and have likelihood to be the only drug for many years that have such a study on this patient group with real hard endpoints.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mikael. Thanks, Louise, for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. So I have two questions. Ian, if you could just help us better understand how the U.S. pricing system might evolve. Currently, the largest percentage of the U.S. drug market is the commercial market which is employer driven, private coverage where the employers and the insurers dictate patient co-pays, et cetera. So, I was hoping that you might be able to help us better understand HHS initiatives to impact rebates in the private sector for out-of-pocket costs in the private sector since that's the majority of the market and the majority of profits for the industry.","And then second, with respect to the reorg, are there cost efficiency opportunities? Maybe, Frank, you could comment on whether this yields cost-efficiency opportunities at all to help offset the Lyrica patent cliff pressure starting next year? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, thank you for the question, Dave. U.S. pricing, I accept that it's companies, that companies and PBMs that set the co-pays and set the structure by which commercial companies pay, there's a system that's opaque in many ways to the end user and to the payer for that matter. So I think that if you have the public sector with clarity on what net price is, then I think you'll see that the private sector will not ignore the net prices that are occurring in the public sector, so I think it will effectively force transparency into the private sector as well. And I would see a situation where patients are paying their co-pays and their coinsurance over net price and not list price, and so I think it's very positive for the health of the pharmaceutical market.","Of course, you may see that rebates in the commercial sector hold on for longer than we expect and we'll have to see exactly how the administration does in fact take away the rebates in the public sector, so there's a lot of uncertainty. So what you're getting is basically a simplified view from my perspective of saying that if the administration is determined to take rebates out and they can act in the public sector, I would expect that transparency to push the private sector to remove rebates and would be pricing over net price. So I think it's very positive for the pharmaceutical industry and for patients.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So, Dave, on your question about the reorg and potential cost efficiency opportunities, the way we think about this, the way I think about this is whenever there's a reorganization like this, it gives us an opportunity to review our processes, to review our operations, and in particular to see if there's opportunities to simplify what we do, how we do it. So yeah, I think there's clearly some opportunities to simplify parts of the business. That simplification could generate some synergies, but our current thinking is we would take those synergies and reinvest those and in particular in areas where we could double down and accelerate on our pipeline to get those products that everyone's been talking to, to market as fast as possible.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for me, just first on tafamidis, one of the pushbacks we get from investors is, can Pfizer launch a drug in rare orphan disease and really build the market out just based on limited track record. So my question to you is, as we think about this market that's largely driven by patients with wild-type cardiomyopathy, just trying to understand. My understanding is the only non-invasive diagnostic is an imaging technique that's not really widely used amongst cardiologists. So can you just talk about, do you just think a new drug drives awareness and that imaging technique would, I don't know, gain broader utilization? Or just how do you ultimately envision the treatment rate expanding?","And then a quick one just on Xeljanz, 2019 formulary negotiations, I imagine you guys have some view there. With the Lilly product coming in at a bigger discount, I'm just kind of curious if you're anticipating any impact from a gross-to-net perspective assuming the current system holds next year. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well on Xeljanz, I think our marketplace is clearly replacing injectable TNF factors and that would be the structure of the pricing. I don't think we're going to be particularly concerned about the pricing of a product that comes in with a, what I would classify as not as strong a label as Xeljanz. So I think we'll leave it at that on that one. And then other question was, Mikael, on tafamidis?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you very much. I think although TTR cardiomyopathy is a rare disease and we spoke about the opportunity to really support early diagnosis of more and more patients, we need to recognize, it is often ending up being managed by cardiologists. And of course, that's a patient and customer group, the cardiologists, where we have years and years of experience and are likely one of the leaders in having the right dialogues and ways to communicate and influence with information of relevance. Specifically, there are non-invasive scintigraphy techniques that can define the amyloidosis of the heart related to TTR.","We are working on algorithms that can help to increase probability that someone has TTR cardiomyopathy and not heart failure and vice versa. And we think combination of improved trials in the clinic scintigraphy and also just by offsets in the scin that proves the position of amyloid will be increasingly common and simple ways to increase diagnosis. And of course, as Albert spoke, as there is a drug, there is an incentive to increase awareness, diagnostic rate and we look really forward to work with physicians and patients to make a drug like this, pending regulatory dialogues, a potential new treatment alternative that may change the lives of many of those patients that today have a very limited life expectancy.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael, and operator, if we could take our last question please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Ian or Albert, you guys have a lot of new product cycles coming in Innovative that should drive growth. I know you've said a spinoff of Essential isn't a strategic priority, but does a more aggressive pace of divesting later cycle or say underperforming franchises make sense? I'm just thinking about what you can do to drive faster growth that may involve shrinking the revenue base.","And then for Mikael, for talazoparib, the PARP class has been less dynamic for investors than originally thought. Maybe you can speak to how you view differentiation and how aggressive you could be when looking at combinations in I-O? And is this a strategic priority for you guys? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Geoff, thank you for the questions. I think what we said was that the previous construct we didn't believe would produce value, the optionality construct we had previously that we were reorganizing around growth factors, that our priority was standing up the new construct of the established products unit with a leader working out of China and that we would continue to look at all alternatives to maximize value, all our different business units to Pfizer. So I hope that answers your question on that and, Mikael, would you like to discuss the other issues?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","We are increasingly excited about the opportunity with talazoparib. It's a really potent PARP inhibitor, and we think it's a unique way of binding and trap the DNA process of replication. May play out as we learn more of it in the clinic to the higher end of efficacy in this drug class and that's really what we are keeping an eye on.","Specifically, we think we also have some unique trials that are based on drug combinations that we have initiated. We have a tissue-agnostic study, EMBRACA, in then mutated cancers across many solid tumors which can be a really pioneering approach for patients that have these mutations and allow, in a tissue-agnostic manner, patients to get a combination of talazoparib and avelumab. It's really based upon that such patients are likely to respond stronger to I-O plus PARP blockade.","We also initiated very recently avelumab\/talazoparib ovarian front-line in high-risk patient Phase 3 study which we think has a unique design and it's a tumor that is likely to have potential to respond to both of these agents in a favorable manner. We really look forward to that study.","And finally, you may know, we have Xtandi and talazoparib combination in DDR positive castration-resistant prostate cancer. So we're building up a quite leading focus, talazoparib portfolio of indications and near-term of course, that EMBRACA data for breast cancer patients with the BRCA mutations have an action date for potential approval December this year.","Charles E.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance, as well as 2016 financial guidance.","I am joined here today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2015, which is located in the For Investors Section in the lower right hand corner of the page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statements. Factor that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as on our reports in Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.","Also, today's call is not intended to, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for, or buy securities of Pfizer or Allergan.","We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you Chuck, and good morning everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top-end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me; and we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in five years.","Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year, and I will close with a few comments about Allergan.","Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets.","Specifically in developed markets, during the year we gained incremental market penetration driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 adults, Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and we still saw steady growth from key inline products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected.","And during the year in emerging markets we saw operational revenue growth primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, Lipitor, and Enbrel, as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established pharma businesses is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit, and we are seeing the expected value contribution to our GAAP business that we anticipated.","Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward.","In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned to win their markets and are performing strongly against their competitors' set.","Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For Bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our six Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of the remaining five Bococizumab lipid-lowering studies [technical difficulty] during 2016.","For [indiscernible], this year, we and our partners Merck will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and two fixed dose combination tablets using data from eight clinical trials.","For Dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for a Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung cancer, and we'll discuss our regulatory strategy with the FDA. So Xeljanz in the first half of this year we expect top line results for our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis when non-biologic DMARDS do not have proven success, and where there are currently few alternatives for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy.","In addition, in the first half of the year we anticipate the decisions from the FDA for a once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to re-file our application for RA in the EU.","For Ibrance, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole, and we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for Ibrance in the E.U. by year end.","Additionally, in the oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. with Xalkori in ROS 1 non-small-cell lung cancer, and we expect to file for approval of Inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. And in immuno-oncology we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong, deep competitive market position. We now have five immuno-oncology assets in the clinic, and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for Avelumab, with seven of them being pivotal registrational studies.","We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registrations in areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric, and lung cancer. Of these seven studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year, and to see data from the other tumor types in the following two years. And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those that have a breadth of portfolio assets to support rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with Avelumab when compared to other companies' assets, and we have already initiated six combination studies with Avelumab.","In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with Keytruda and in combination with Avelumab in various tumors, 4-1BB in combination with Rituximab in lymphoma, a combination of Lorlatinib, our next generation ALK inhibitor with Avelumab and ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, and data from [indiscernible] with Avelumab in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking of all of this into account, we believe we are well on our way to being a leading player in this space.","And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing two great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about acceleration growth potential in our innovative businesses and strengthening our established business, and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016.","Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan, and have been delighted by the engagement and rapport that is occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in information in gastroenterology, and we have a -- when we will have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis and Bystolic.","In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","When you look at over the next few years we expect both companies will continue -- contribute, sorry, several potential new drugs to launch. We'll also continue to be excited about the international potential. And by coming together, we are enhancing category leadership throughout our complementary inline portfolio, and a combined pipeline with great late-stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to the provost combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.","Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a competitive product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure, and financial position, and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy, while preserving our options as putting the company into an innovative business and an established business. If we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders.","By the end of the current quarter our integration teams will be fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In summary, we're looking at a year ahead we have a sound strategy, and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into the account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products, as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading inline products, a healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of the business with the pending addition of Allergan. We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines to patients by producing expected top line growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business development, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Ian. Good day everyone. As always, the charts that we're viewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations.","Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include three months of legacy Hospira Global operations. By comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations.","Now, moving on to the financials; fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion, and reflect year-over-year operational growth of 1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations. The continued strong performance of products that are early in their lifecycles such as Prevnar 13 adult, Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in emerging markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13, and certain other products.","Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of 934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of 1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of 35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer-standalone achieved operational growth of 646 million or 5% while at the same time absorbing a 720 million negative operational impact from product losses of exclusivity.","Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses or 1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new, in-line, and acquired products, lower effective tax rate, and few diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 125 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to our share repurchase program which includes the impact of $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition related cost, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter, and non-recurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize Avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters, and a lower effective tax rate.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year ago quarter.","Now, moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments; in the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operational year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan.","Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase of revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of low royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales.","IBT was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Chantix, and 11% operational increase in R&D reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline primarily for Bococizumab and Tanezumab.","Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally driven by 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues to the strong uptake among adults.","Global oncology revenues grew 61% operationally driven by Ibrance in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And consumer healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S.","Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues and associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched consumer healthcare products, Ibrance, and Prevnar 13 adult. And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with oncology oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and Ibrance.","Fourth quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S.","Emerging market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East.","Income before taxes declined 12% operationally reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity, a 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased legacy Hospira development programs.","We exceeded the top of our guidance range of expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7% at the low-end of our guidance range due to increased Alliance revenues and sales volumes, and we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of the favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings.","We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top-end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses are $14.3 billion, or higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products such as Prevnar 13 adult and Ibrance, other inline products, and certain Consumer Healthcare brands.","We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was a $1.24 versus our expected range of a $1.37 to a $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, and non-recurring charges related to pension settlements.","Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan.","Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new inline and acquired product that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that that would be in this range and consistent with our previous comments we expect full year Prevnar 13 adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level.","We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates in 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on the reported revenues, including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion.","Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity, as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of a $1.54 to a $1.67, and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range $2.20 to $2.30.","In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs.","In summary, to exclude anticipated foreign exchange impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.","Now moving on to key takeaways, we had a very strong financial performance in 2015 and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their lifecycles and we achieved this growth despite a 3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity.","Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of 49 billion to 51 billion absorbs a 4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela.","We announced our proposed combination with Allergan, and continue to expect the transaction to close the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016, and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin Bristow","Good morning, and congrats on the solid finish for the year. So a couple of product-specific questions if I may, on the Prevnar franchise, you've posted strong 4Q numbers. Could you just talk about your expectations for the trajectory going forward? On Ibrance there's been a lot of discussion around [indiscernible], and the potential there for a threat to Ibrance. What's your view here?","And then just lastly on Biosimilars, can you update us on the status of your Biosimilar candidates, and when we should expect any data readouts? Thanks.","Ian Read","Thank you, Colin. I'll ask Albert to manage the Prevnar and Ibrance, and then pass it over to John for Biosimilars.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much for the question, Colin. Let me provide some insight to help you understand the situation moving forward. In the U.S., obviously we have done an excellent job with the catch-up opportunity. We have achieved 86% markets there, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awareness of the recommendation at healthcare practitioner. And as a result, over the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about a third [ph] of them.","Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture, as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies that we all have in place, but even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it will be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this will be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable, with much larger eligible population, and who have already received pneumonia in our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations, and following that reimbursement from the authorities.","Now this will be phased likely over a two-years window period, because in Europe this is done country-by-country, and sometimes region-by-region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year.","Now let me move on Ibrance, and your question about competition or particularly [indiscernible] drug. Look, [indiscernible] drug, while in the same class, is for any [ph] indication. The refractory patient population, what we have received breakthrough designation, is a very small population with few options available. In fact the average refractory patient undergoes seven lines of treatment. So it's -- they are in high-mid.","Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain, and we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in U.S., and six other countries, and an accepted filing in Europe, where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. Ibrance has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far feedback is very positive, particularly on patients' quality of life.","We are having a very heavy clinical program. We have two pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, two studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, and three in early breast cancer, PENELOPE-B, PALLAS, and PEARL [ph]. Ibrance is part of 88 investigational initiated trials, approximately 50 in breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert. I think just on Ibrance, you mentioned next year for Europe, you meant this year, late this year we may be able to get registration\u2026","Albert Bourla","Correct in '16, I mean. Sorry. I apologize.","Ian Read","Yes, thank you. Go ahead.","John Young","Okay. So thanks for the question on Biosimilars, Colin. So I think we're obviously very excited to being able to bring together the combination of Hospira's current inline biosimiliars which are already in the market. So we have three assets, as you know, which are already in the market in Europe, Nivestim, Retacrit, and Inflectra. And to bring that together along with the legacy Pfizer monoclonal antibody pipeline, plus some additional assets that Hospira have. So in total, when you look at the pipeline, we have nine distinct biosimilar molecules in different stages of development. Infliximab, outside of the E.U., Adalimumab, Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab, Rituximab, Pegfilgrastim, Ranibizumab, Denosumab, and Ustekinumab.","So overall we have a very strong pipeline. A number of those assets are in Phase III, late-phase development. And the first dataset there you'd be seeing from our Phase III studies would come from the legacy Pfizer Infliximab program where we would expect to produce data from our Phase III towards the end of this year.","Ian Read","Thank you, John.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, John.","Chuck Triano","Operator, can we please move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Chuck Triano","Jami? Okay, Jami. We may come back to Jami if she's -- if we can correct the technical issues. If not, let's go to Alex.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Frank, your gross margin for 2016 is better than we expected, considering you're integrating a lower margin business in Hospira and losing exclusivity on some high-margin products. Can you help us understand what's driving that, and how we should think about -- and should we expect traditional margin expansion going forward, given that your Innovative business is growing at a faster rate?","And then on Hospira's contribution this quarter, it doesn't seem to reflect much revenue synergies. Obviously it's too early, but how should we think about Hospira's contribution next year and possible revenue synergies going forward? Thank you.","Frank D'Amelio","So Alex, on the gross margin, let me run the numbers and then I'll answer the question. So we ended the full year at 18.5% in terms of cost of sale. So I'll do the cost of sale. The reciprocal obviously is gross margin. We got it for next year across the sales number of 21% to 22%. So if you take the midpoint of that 21 to 22, just to make the math easy, that's 21.5% from our 18.5%. That's a 3%, 300 basis point increase in our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira.","In terms of -- I think your question, which was why wasn't even more, I think the answer is our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service, and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle. But there's four major buckets, right? There's the number of facilities, there's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective, and then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all four of those very aggressively to basically -- to manage our cost structure in manufacturing, but that gives you a feel for what the numbers were, and why they are what they are.","Ian Read","Please, John.","John Young","So thanks, Alex. So obviously, again, we are very excited by the opportunities afforded us by the combination of our two businesses. And I think I've talked about biosimilars already, and the opportunities we see in that marketplace. So let me just touch briefly on sterile injectables. Obviously it's a very -- it's a large, it's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally, and one of the sort of features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex-U.S. markets, such as Western Europe, and particularly China.","So, one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China, and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially the lag time since September when we closed this transaction we've been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately. To be very focused on registering and brining those molecules to market.","So in the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware. Drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short-term, as well as medium and long-term to deliver significant growth ex-U.S. through the sterile injectable business and the combination of Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, John. And operator, see if we can get Jami Rubin back.","Operator","The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Sorry about that. Don't really know what happened on my end, but anyway, just a few questions. Frank, can you tell us what the Venezuela revenues are? I guess we are in consensus, we're surprised by the size of the hit; can you all hear me?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes, we can hear you. You're a little static, but we can hear you.","Jami Rubin","Okay, sorry about that. Anyway, so Frank, if you could just provide more color on Venezuela? And why such a big hit?","And then Ian, just a couple of questions for you, just back on this whole breakup thesis and the timing, I think investors initially were disappointed by the timing that you laid out at the time that you were announcing Allergan deal. I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. I just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal, and I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this, but I would think that that would -- that the difference in -- even growing gap in valuation between where your stock is in an SOTP should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction, and if you could just comment on that please.","And then just, thirdly, on revenue growth. I mean, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency, and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth -- or just talk about operationally revenue growth, when we should start to see a positive inflection point, because it has, when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years and some of that's divestitures, and spins, but really since 2013, we've had revenues sort of flat to down. When is that going to change, and what's going to drive that change, just talking from Pfizer's standpoint? Thanks very much.","Frank D'Amelio","Let me just do the revenue growth first. Well, you know, as I said, '15 was the first year when we saw revenue growth; '16, we expect it to be around operationally narrow. We expect it to be Hospira and Allergan, we expect it to be flat and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in '15, and we'll hold that franchise. We won't grow it again. We'll have good growth from our inline products and our newly launched products, but we'll still deal with a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see, as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trial in Ibrance as we begin to see the launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us returning to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons for doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our innovative business. So we're aware of that issue.","Now this is the breakup timing. Number one, I point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than a DRG. In fact I think it's roughly the same as a DRG, and in fact, given the our pressure that one would expect in a stock, I'm actually -- well, never like to see the stock go down. It certainly was expected to come under pressure from the odd community.","Now the breakup timing is an issue of -- we are focused on integrating this company and the two companies together, and we have laid out the full questions that we need to answer. And I think shareholder would want those questions answered. So, can we run the businesses successfully insider Pfizer? And we bought Hospira. You are seeing the sterile injectables. You have got the Biosimilars. You're beginning to see if you strip out the LOEs and stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth, but that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trade value and can we unlock trade value in tax efficient manner? And these are the very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by innovating we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders. And frankly, don't particularly see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done and integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for more speedy decision, but I think we are taking the right approach for shareholder value here.","Ian Read","Venezuela?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes.","Ian Read","So, Jami, the Venezuela revenues for -- I'll call it initially projected for 2016 were about $800 million, roughly the same size as 2015. If you look at the adjustments, we took -- we changed the exchange rate from 6.3 Bolivar to a dollar to 200 Bolivar to dollar. We went to the SIMADI rate for Venezuela. That change in the translation is what causes the adjustment that we made for 2016, and we thought that the timing of that adjustment was appropriate, given oil prices, given what's going on in Venezuela economically, given the dollars that are coming out of Venezuela, we thought the timing for this was appropriate. But it's really the 6.3 to 200 to the dollar conversion that's really causing the adjustment to 2016.","Frank D'Amelio","Now, Jami, ongoing, when Venezuela passes through this crisis and they re-establish a normal economy, we would expect Venezuela to grow back to be in the -- between 200 and 400 million a year. So the actual delta medium-term is for the 400 million between what was an overvalued currency.","Jami Rubin","Thank you.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Ian and Frank. Can we move to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Hi. Three questions please, two of them of very short. Firstly, perhaps you could just outline sequential growth for China, say, [technical difficulty] last quarter? Second, do you anticipate extra notice from Treasury on conversion, and obviously [technical difficulty] how restricted do you see any measures to impact the Allergan transaction? And then finally, just returning to [indiscernible], the patients in the ongoing Phase 2 trial, which accelerates approval that have not seen Palbociclib in early line of therapy, is that an approval possessing given the design of that trial, given the fact you are approved for indication or does that include any regulatory approval for the drug? Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay. I am going to do the notice first. We at the moment understand that the Treasury are working on formalizing and regulating the first two notices they issued, which are not in many ways applicable to our transaction as we're at the below 50% ownership.","I really can't speculate if there is going to be a third notice or not. We feel confident the transaction is fully within the U.S. law and fully within accepted interpretation of that law and expect the transaction to close in the second half of next year.","With that, I'll go to growth to Frank, and I would ask Mikael to talk about Palbociclib.","Andrew Baum","And with China.","Frank D'Amelio","On China, for the quarter, China grew 10%. Full year, China grew about 10%. Nice numbers. Somewhat moderated from 2014. In 2014, China grew to about 15%. So, we saw some moderation in the growth in China.","That said, Andrew, we remain very bullish on China. Has an increasing population, increasing personal wealth, government is committed to healthcare. We see increased spending in the government and the GDP rate is still very healthy. Not as high as it has been the past, but still quite healthy. So, we remain very bullish on the China market on going forward basis.","Ian Read","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you, Andrew, for a good question here. Two things; first, I want to just to point out that Abemaciclib is somewhat different from Palbo and Novartis drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different resident profile likely due to hitting multiple CDKs particularly been reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile, and we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from Ibrance with very good reliability.","Now you asked about this late stage population studies Abema [ph], and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate as Ibrance is having a very nice uptake in the marketplace in first line metastatic and some also more advanced lines, and hopefully with Prevnar 3 approval, Ibrance is likely to be used in multiple lines.","Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will of course have the potential to face patient population that have seen CDK inhibitor, and that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from drug like Ibrance at various stages with different anti-hormonals. And we are also now studying Ibrance in triple therapy. So I think you can see that multiple drugs is likely to be the preferred as patients become more advanced.","Andrew Baum","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So\u2026","Ian Read","Good morning.","Vamil Divan","Hi, good morning. Just again on Biosimilars front, I know there has been a couple of questions, but just a couple of more if I could. One is specifically on Enbrel, and if you can discuss in terms of 2016 how you are viewing the impact of Biosimiliars to your performance for that product?","And then second, now that Hospira has closed, I am just wondering, I guess this is a question for John or whoever wants to jump in, in terms of the value having a Biosimilar business under the same broad umbrella as your innovative business so you can leverage that commercial infrastructure areas like oncology and autoimmune disorders. Is there any way sort of maybe make more sense than to keep Pfizer as a single entity as opposed to splitting up and then needing to rebuild the commercial infrastructure for your Biosimilars in those similar areas where you do have innovative products? Thanks.","Ian Read","Vamil, I'll ask Geno to talk about Enbrel and the impact of Biosimilars in Europe.","Geno Germano","Sure. So, the first Biosimilar for Etanercept has been approved in Europe. And we've watching the situation very closely and evaluating adoption of Biosimilars across each of the countries throughout Europe for awhile now.","Our overall expectation is that there will be somewhat modest impact in 2016. The Biosimilar landscape is clearly still developing. There are different approaches taken by different countries. And we have a very clear detailed roadmap for how to address each of the dynamics that exist in these different countries.","So we are fairly confident that we are going to continue to have a strong Enbrel business throughout Europe. We think that the new patients would be probably most at risk of being exposed to the Biosimilars and hope that the availability of lower cost biologics will expand the market. So overall, we see this as again a modest impact to our business in the initial period of time.","Ian Read","And Vamil, maybe a very interesting question on the connectivity between the Biosimilars and the other space. I would say that that would be taken into account if there was any such linkage that was positive in our TSAs, the setup the separate companies to ensure that that as overall we maximize value of that between both companies in the contracts we would sign if we decided to split. Thank you.","Vamil Divan","Thanks, Ian.","Chuck Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Couple of questions. First, apologizes if I missed the explanation, but the 2016 guidance includes roughly an incremental 4 billion in revenue and $0.08 in earnings from Hospira implying down to significantly down underlying sales for the legacy Pfizer and flattish to down EPS, and it seems that generic exposure in currency cannot be the explanation because the predicted 4.6 billion hurdle in 2016 from these factors is well less than the 6 billion plus predicted in 2015 at this time last year.","So actually the comparison on generic exposure in currency is improving and more than offsets the year-over-year increase in Prevnar. So, any thoughts on that would be appreciated.","And one more, how should we think about the long-term outlook for Sutent particularly given the competition from immuno-oncology agent. You think Sutent will soon become a defining asset or do you see growth in the future? Thanks.","Ian Read","I'll ask Albert to talk about Sutent and its possible combinations and the other studies we have already had on Sutent. And then, I'll ask Frank to come back on your questions about growth rates.","Albert Bourla","We remain very confident in our position in the RCC space and that includes both, Sutent and Inlyta, because they are very well known by physicians and other stakeholders. The recent approval in RCC for immunotherapy but this does not affect Sutent. It is in the second line. Sutent is used primarily in first line. And s we have previously disclosed we are studying Inlyta, and Inlyta plus other PD-1 inhibitors pretty aggressively so that we can achieve better result in monotherapy in RCC second line.","Ian Read","Frank?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. Let's see if I can answer the question. Just first, we don't give a specific number for Hospira revenues for 2016. But that said, I believe I could still answer the question. So, the way I think about this is if you enter the midpoint of the guidance prior to foreign exchange in Venezuela, which is part of the basis of your question, the midpoint for guidance would be 52.3 just to use midpoint. We take 50.3 compare that to the 48.9 that we printed in 2015 are all now at the same foreign exchange, so, clearly operational. That's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said -- Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira on a year-over-year basis was essentially flat operationally while absorbing 2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016.","The other data point I think to help you answer the question is, remember, we did 1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So, when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the 1.5 billion that we printed in 2015. So that's how I think -- that's how you get to numbers we said and why we said operationally the numbers were essentially flat if you left Hospira out of the equation.","Steve Scala","Thank you, Frank.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey, guys. How are you doing? Thanks for being so clear on the communications in the quarter. I have one question that's been danced around but maybe let me just ask you it again and hope so I won't annoy you, but I'll try again.","So first is do you believe that there is anything, Ian, under the current U.S. statute that would allow treasury to block and\/or materially delay the closing of the AGN deal? So I am asking you if there will be third proposed notice. I am asking you under the current law, are you very -- do you remain I guess very comfortable there is nothing that treasury legally could do to block the deal or to materially delay it like in the 2017 when there will be a new a congress and a new president.","And then I would also just for Frank perhaps just like you talked a little about your leverage ratio, if my math is right, the leverage ratio of the combined company the NewCo should closer to be around 1? By my math, you could take that to maybe 3 without affecting credit ratings in a big way, I would like to hear -- that's my math and I am not very good at math, so I would love to hear your general thoughts around leverage ratio of the NewCo where you might be willing to take that should the deal close. Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mark. And thank you for the compliment on the clarity to communications. We strive to make them clear. So on your question which I don't think on the current law, I do not believe there is any reason why this deal will not close; full stop.","Frank D'Amelio","Mark, let me run some numbers. So on leverage let me run the Pfizer numbers based on third quarter. We haven't issued a balance sheet yet for the fourth quarter. We will do that when we file the K. We had about 37 billion of cash in investments. We had about 39 billion of debt, short and long term debt. So to your point call that one to one essentially, and what we said when we announced the Allergan deal, what I said was we could take the leverage ratio at yield point up to about 2.5 to 3.","And then, obviously, once took it there, we would want to see what kind of rhythm that created relative to the company, the operation supporting the company in that we take it there, but that we still want access to commercial paper. We would be willing take a one notch downgrade but we would still want to have access to commercial paper. But in terms of your math and your calculation 2.5 to 3, that's right. That's basically what I talked about when we announced the Allergan deal. So, your math was good.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman","Yes, few things. One is can you tell us what the key products are in Venezuela, if there are any massive ones that we need to be hitting the model on? Second, Frank, maybe you can go through some of the push-pulls on SG&A and how you are thinking about the spending this year? And then, third, can you just give us an update on the IL-6? Thanks.","Ian Read","So key products, I don't think there's any outstanding product, but the Enbrel is the biggest product that contributes. John, would you want to add anything to that?","John Young","Yes, I think the Enbrel is the biggest product. I think in addition to that we have a portfolio of matured established product, Lipitor and Norvasc would be other key products for us in Venezuela. So really just think about the basket of established products and the fit in that marketplace.","Ian Read","Okay. The SG&A? Yes.","Frank D'Amelio","So, Marc, on SG&A, let me just talk to the quarter and then I'll talk to the rhythm of the numbers. So if you look at the quarter, we had a big spend in SG&A. It's 4.6 billion all in. Three major factors there, right, one, obviously the inclusion of Hospira, which added a couple of hundred million. Two, sequentially, if you think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So, internationally, we had six more selling days. Domestically, we had two more selling days.","So, sequentially, Q3 of '15 to Q4 of '15, we had more selling days. So obviously it helps revenue, but also increases the spend on our line items. And then, we had obviously I alluded to in my comments increased promotional spend in many areas of the business.","Now, if you take that 4.6 and you annualize it, times 2 is what? 9.2 times 2 is 18.4. If you look at the guidance we gave for next year on SI&A, it's 13.2 to 14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4 number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016, which is a combination of Hospira numbers, the selling days, and then the increased spend in the quarter. But we look at it for next year, we get a number that our annual basis is significantly lower than what that annualized number would be.","Ian Read","And, Mikael, do you want to discuss IL-6?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you for your question. So we tested IL-6 antibody in Lupus and [indiscernible], and while antibody did show some activity, we found that overall profile did not compete as well as many other real interesting immunology agents and other opportunities we have in our very rich pipeline of 90 clinical programs. So this is part of prudent portfolio prioritization within Pfizer.","Marc Goodman","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Can we move to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions and for all the clarity that you've given on the '16 guidance. Ian, first question on the timing around the breakup, I think you've indicated that integration of Allergan is very important. You've also indicated that you had time to look even deeper into the Allergan portfolio.","As you think about integration, can you give us some more commentary around how you are thinking about mapping out integration? Some look at Wyeth and look at the massive amount of synergies that you are able to extract out of Wyeth transaction and are somewhat puzzled as to why you can't do that here. So, any commentary around that?","Two additional questions; one on CDK 4\/6, this one is for Mikael. Mikael, when you look at preclinical models, is there any argument or hypothesis around a drug that has to be given intermittently that it might have less efficacy than one that's given on a continuous dosing? And is that supported by any preclinical models?","And then, the last question just has to do with Xeljanz. Obviously, a very important asset for you not only in the U.S. but on the EU timing for filing, I think you indicated you wanted to have that filed before the end of the year. Just any update on what Europe is looking for within that filing to secure approval in Europe?","And then, on psoriasis in the U.S., any developments there on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint and then obviously with Enbrel seeing generic competition what have you done with your infrastructure in Europe to still keep some infrastructure in place to support Xeljanz if and when it gets approved?","Ian Read","Okay. So let me just -- quickly the last one first, we still have very strong expectations from Enbrel in Europe as Geno was discussing. We are not removing our support from Enbrel. So we expect to have full support for Xeljanz when it launches in Europe. There was a somewhat of a slippage from -- as you say, the end of the year to the beginning of this year on the Xeljanz application in Europe. We wanted to get it right and make sure that it was in the best shape we could, and these things happened. So there was a slight slippage on time on that. Mikael, do you want to deal with this hypothetical on CDK 4\/6?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, thank you for the questions. Of course, always we would caution you can speculate on things that haven't been studied in humans in comparative aspects, but you know, we think it's important to hit CDK 4\/6 hard for breast cancer, and when you do that with high doses you will get efficacy on the tumor, but also see some neutropenia and that's we why chose the intermittent schedules. Particularly it seems very effective for combination therapy with multiple agents such as [indiscernible] in breast cancer.","For other tumor types, we may explore various schedules for various combination of drugs, but for breast cancer we think to show some schedule with the combinations we have studied is very effective and works well.","Ian Read","Thank you. Geno, you want to deal with the other questions that John asked on Xeljanz?","Geno Germano","Yes. John, I think the question -- as Ian had already alluded to, we are now expecting our filing to be in the first quarter of this year. We're actually meeting with [indiscernible] at this point. We did generate additional data on immune function as a result of the discussions that we had with the regulators in the first submission. So we feel that we have a strong package that we have responded to the information requests that they had, and we're just tidying up the kind of last few details and expect to put that filing in imminently.","Ian Read","And psoriasis and -- so, question on psoriasis? In the U.S\u2026","Geno Germano","So psoriasis -- well, as you probably know we have a -- we received a complete response letter from the FDA on psoriasis. We have provided a backgrounder to the FDA, and we expect to meet with them also this quarter to follow-up on the components of the complete response letter, and once we know in more detail what their issues and concerns are, then we'll determine best way forward from there.","Ian Read","Thank you. Frank, do you want to deal with the\u2026","Frank D'Amelio","Synergy number?","Ian Read","Yes.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. So we have certainly announced the deal more than $2 billion. We gave you the timing in terms of when we would get that. A couple of comments, John, to your question, I think first why more than $2 billion, why not a higher number? I think these are two companies that have done a lot on the cost reduction front; significant reductions at both companies, I think efficiently run companies. Two, not a lot of therapeutic area overlap, which is always seeing a kind of a trigger for synergy opportunities. Third, if you look at the Allergan cost of goods sold, two-thirds of that from my perspective, from a synergy perspective was unaddressable. It's their end of business and then royalties. So really not a lot we could do there, but all that said and done, we're working now with the Allergan teams with Brent, with Bob Steward, with Tessa. Ian and myself, our leadership team here at Pfizer, we've already launched a couple of operational teams, and we're starting to dig into this in much more detail. If there is more there, please know we're going to get it, and we'll tell you about it. So I think on a synergy front just more to come.","Ian Read","Yes. And you know, John, the process from this deal was not huge cost synergies, it was about driving revenue growth in the innovative business, driving reasonably young portfolios, taking the products internationally, and then getting excellent capital allocation over the world. So we will get the synergies we can get, but our focus is on growth, and a lot of the questions on the call have been about growth. So this is part of the solution to that, and also really a good capital allocation.","Frank D'Amelio","Thank you for the questions.","John Boris","Thanks, Ian.","Chuck Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. If I could go back to the revenue guidance, the midpoint is about $2.5 billion below consensus, you flagged FX was a major headwind. I know that we spend a lot of time trying to incorporate FX, and I imagine consensus does too, yet that's still a very big delta. So my question on this is when you look at analyst models, are there particular revenue line items for products or divisions where you think consensus is too high unrelated to foreign exchange?","Second question, you mentioned the 4-1BB with Merck, and I'm showing foundation data with Keytruda. That's Phase I data, so as such I'm blinded -- I'm wondering if you can give us a preview of the tumor types here you think are most promising and also any preliminary safety findings?","And then last pipeline question, last year you mentioned having an oral PCSK9 approaching human development, and I'm wondering if that is now in the clinic when I look at your pipeline chart I see a new compound has been advanced on the Phase I?","Ian Read","Okay. Frank, if you could deal with the first question, and Mikael will have remaining two.","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So Tim, let me run the numbers in, then I'll answer the questions. So your numbers are right. So consensus numbers give or take on revenue for 2016 about 52.4 billion the midpoint of all guidance $50 billion, the net there is roughly 2.5 billion that you alluded to, just to kind of nail the numbers.","I think two major pieces in terms of the GAAP; one is, clearly the Venezuela adjustment we made in 2016 wouldn't have been at the 52.4. So that's an $800 million adjustment. That would take a 52.4 to 51.6, and then I think when you look at the line items, I think the big difference [technical difficulty] if you ask me to point out one single place, it's Prevnar 13. Significant results, and the growth expectations in Prevnar 13 -- '16 versus our modeling for '16 where I said in my comments, and Albert punctuated in some of his detailed remarks about we're expecting that to be essentially comparable to 2015 levels. Those are the two things that I would point out that will make up the majority big piece of the difference in terms of your 2.5 billion.","Ian Read","Thank you. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","So thank you for asking about 4-1BB, and as you know, we believe that the combination therapy moved immuno-oncology feel to the next level. We are very pleased with the 4-1BB, one of tumor antibody that we have. We have started eating combination with Rituximab in lymphoma and with PD-1 Keytruda in a small study across various tumor types, and have also initiated combination study with Avelumab.","The 4-1BB antibody, the Pfizer antibody shows very good tolerability when combined with other biological agents, and it's clinical performance suggest also very interesting favorable clinical activity on top of other biologicals, such as Rituximab and PD-1 Keytruda. We will share the date from this first cohort this year likely at ASCO. We are quite excited about 4-1BB and also OX40 that's in our pipeline, and you will see 4-1BB Avelumab data likely late this year as well OX40 monodata, and early next year several doublets and triplets, which makes me very enthusiastic as I look forward how we advanced the strategy of combinations therapy.","We have an oral PCSK9 in Phase I. It's too early to have any definitive interpretation of that data, and we also have a PCSK9 vaccine in late preclinical development.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard Purkiss","Oh, thanks. I have a couple of questions for Mikael, just on Ibrance, can you flag any upcoming data for tumor types outside of breast cancer that we should look out for? Also, can you update on how well the Adjuvant breast cancer studies are enrolling? Thanks.","Ian Read","Mikae, would you like to\u2026","Mikeal Dolsten","Yes. I could say a few words, so as Albert alluded to, there is a large number of Ibrance study, the great majority by investing in initiative research. So we will have to see as these studies result report emerging. I can say that we also have sponsor-led studies outside breasts, that includes pancreatic cancer, and head and neck, and we're also looking at triple therapy in breast cancer. I remain optimistic and excited about Ibrance performance, and think we will see interesting datasets coming from several of these new tumor types.","Ian Read","Enrollment? It's going well?","Albert Bourla","Yes, actually I can only add here. But likely the Mantel cell lymphoma, and the neck we may see data even this year. And then many of the areas that Mikael discussed, including small-cell-lung, we may see next year.","Chuck Triano","Okay, thanks Albert and Mikael. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question, just a couple of quick ones. On Bevacizumab, given Pfizer's experience in cardiovascular I was just curious what your thoughts on the demand trends were, looking peripherally at the PCSK9 class today. I know a lot looking forward depends on outcomes data, but just curious about whether there's a tipping point, and the position adoption.","And then just on Biosimilars in the U.S., just wanted to get you guys to view on where you think the FDA is with respect to extrapolation when we're looking at the upcoming senior panel next week. Thanks.","Ian Read","Geno, any comments on that?","Geno Germano","Yes, I mean I think I would just reinforce the comment that you made. I mean, it's been our contention all along that this class becomes a real class in managing these patients with the cardiovascular outcome data, that we'll be seeing either late this year or starting next year. Our program is advancing nicely. We have, as you know, two cardiovascular trials. And the SPIRE-2 trial, which is in the high-risk patient population, we've now reached the point where we've discontinued screening. We're almost completely enrolled. And that trial is moving along very rapidly. And the SPIRE-1 trial will be completely enrolled by the end of this year or early next year.","So we're looking forward to these data, and the impact that we think they're going to have on the marketplace.","John Young","So, on the Inflectra AdCom, as you know it's scheduled for February 9, next week. I think it would probably be premature to speculate on the view that the FDA will take. We certainly think that this will be extremely informative as to the FDA's views and perspectives on extrapolation. I think obviously their product is being filed by Xeljanz. So specific questions about the AdCom really should be directed to Xeljanz, but I would say is that while we obviously await the resolution of the advisory committee and certain other factors. We're certainly moving ahead with the preparation for launch plans in 2016.","Chuck Triano","Thanks Geno, and John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. I have three questions. First, Ian, besides the likelihood of closing, what do think investors most under-appreciate about the Allergan merger? Second, I guess these are two financial questions. One is with respect to Enbrel ex-U.S. Could you just give us a sense for the percentage of revenue that is in countries where Biosimilars are launching in 2016, so that we have a sense for the percentage of Enbrel revenue that's exposed to Biosimilar threat?","And then finally, Frank, if you could just run through the cash flow outlook for 2016, the operating cash flow, and then the planned use of funds. Thank you.","Ian Read","David, again on your question on Allergan, our interactions with the shareholders, both sell side and buy side have been very positive. I don't think in reality there's anything underappreciated, other than the Street's perception of risk around the close. I would direct you back of course to the excitement I have about the products that Allergan have that they just launched, about their phase III products, both in depression, and in diabetic gastroparesis. And they just got breakthrough status, so -- and the combination of our information knowledge and RTAs with Xeljanz around their area. Our jacks around their expertise net area. I think perhaps the Street is just -- is right now hung up on this close issue. So bio, John?","John Young","Yes, David on the question regarding percentage of Enbrel business potentially exposed to Biosimilar competition, I don't have a figure on the top of my head. I would say more than 50% of the ex-U.S. business would be in the European Union, where we expect to see biosimilars. We won't -- we're not expecting to see it in Japan, Australia, and several of the Latin American countries. But I would say it's more than 50% of the business.","Frank D'Amelio","And then the last question was on '16 operating cash flow. The way I'll answer this David, is if you look at our operating cash flow through three quarters, it was about $10 billion. We expect the fourth quarter to be healthy in terms of the operating cash flow for the year. And then obviously 2016, we expect -- we want to obviously continue to grow that operating cash flow number. And then in terms of the uses, from my perspective, the uses of how we deploy our capital haven't changed, obviously investing in our business, returning capital to shareholders. I mentioned in my remarks we returned 13.1 billion to our shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, and obviously looking at some bolt-on acquisitions if those make sense. So -- but no change. It would be how I'd answer the question on capital allocation.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks, also a three-parter. First Frank, what level of detail should we expect in the proxy in terms of your long-term projections, similar to the Pfizer Wyeth documents or any difference and any caveats you'd like to order to let us know about before folks start slapping accretion percentages on those numbers?","Secondly, going back to something you said earlier. Taking your leverage to two-and-a-half to three times for Newco, and if you were to apply that capital to buybacks that would create EPS accretion that's far beyond what you've suggested. So just would like your thoughts on what you'd be doing with that leverage or is that just kind of a hypothetical.","And third, for John, do you still see the benefit of the Hospira device business alongside the drug business as you originally thought? Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay, John, could you deal with Hospira first please?","John Young","Yes, sure. I think we would say that in the Hospira infusion systems business, which comprises pumps, consumables, large volume solutions. We believe we acquired a very valuable asset. It provides novel capabilities in an adjacent area. And that adds significant value to customers, and their patients. And we are committed to ensuring its success in the short, medium, and longer term.","Ian Read","Okay, Frank, on the leverage and then the loan level of detail.","Frank D'Amelio","Level of detail, and the proxy.","Ian Read","Yes.","Frank D'Amelio","So I think on level of detail, we'll be providing revenue details, EPS details. It would be directed out, I believe, it's several years, five years. So there'll be information out there relative to projections on the company; on the leverage number, the 2.5 to 3, in my mind that's what's possible. In terms of what we did on buybacks, we tried to provide information when we announced the deal to give you all the data you needed. So that when you connected the dots you could model what at buyback numbers would be, right.","So we started out with the accretion dilution. We said neutral in year one, modestly accretive in year one, more than 10% in year three, and then high teens in year four. We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be. It was 10.6 billion shares. We said we'd have 5.5 billion, and Allergan would have 4.7 billion. And then we gave the tax rate, which was 17% to 18%. So with those data points, we felt we provided the information that you needed in order to model what the buybacks would be. And then just to the two-and-a-half to three, now clearly there could be some extra juice if we took the leverage ratio up to that level.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks, just two quick ones here. First, just more broadly on emerging markets, can you talk about the growth outlook here maybe beyond China, just given the current economic environment we're seeing? Has there been any change in your growth expectations there?","And then the second question for Ian. I know you've obviously had a very large deal pending right now. But how are you thinking of business development given the recent volatility and kind of valuation reset we see in the market. I guess what's the size and scope of assets that you could be interested at this point, given the upcoming Allergan transaction. And maybe how quickly post the Allergan transaction could this company start considering larger deals if there was an attractive opportunity in the market.","Ian Read","Thank you. John, you want to talk about China?","John Young","Yes, sure. So I mean, I think as we always say, Chris, on the emerging markets. We're always going to see courses and course of volatility. But at the same time we continue to expect to see growth numbers in the mid-single digit mid to high single-digit range. Frank's already talked about China. We continue to be very positive about the prospects in the short, medium, and longer term in China. It's obviously not just the world's largest country, with 1.3, 1.4 billion population, but we continue to see a strong government commitment to expanding access to to quality healthcare. We are very encouraged by steps that we see the government taking in the regulatory environment to really enhance quality standards in the marketplace.","And whilst there are few headwinds, GDP growth is slowly but still positive, still mid single-digit percentage. We are seeing some pressure on pricing. But overall when you put all of those factors together, we can continue to see China being a very positive growth driver.","Ian Read","Thank you, John. On BD, Chris, we see we would be more focused to smaller deals than larger deals right now. But once we close, we'll look at the opportunities. And we know we still have substantial flexibility and of course it will be measured against the alternative usage of that cash which right now are scheduled for buybacks and the accretion equation. So we'll make the decisions that we believe are best for shareholders and we will take it into account the -- what the asset priced at the time when we close.","Frank D'Amelio","And Chris, the only thing I would add is we, Pfizer-standalone today generate a lot of operating cash flow. The combine new company we said by 2018 would be generating in excess of $25 billion a year in operating cash flow. So, new company will generate significant amounts of operating cash flow. Thank you.","Chris Schott","All right.","Chuck Triano","And can we take our last question please, operator?","Operator","Your final question comes from Manoj Garg from HealthCo.","Manoj Garg","Hi, it's Manoj. Thanks for taking the question. A couple on the pending Allergan transaction and one on next Tuesday, on Allergan, one, I guess if maybe just if you can highlight, what are some of the levers that would dictate whether the deal would close in early second half of '16 versus later in the second half?","Two is, for Frank, on the $2 billion synergy number if you can just quantify as we fine-tune our pro forma model, if that's a gross number or an net number?","Ian Read","Okay. On the lever, Doug Lankler, would you indicate what you see the levers are for the close?","Doug Lankler","Sure. So, Manoj, we're working closely with regulators. We are pleased with the profits that we are making. We like the standpoint from the complementary nature of the businesses. And as a result, we continue to expect to close the transaction during the second half.","Manoj Garg","Thank you.","Doug Lankler","It's a net number.","Manoj Garg","Synergy number is a net number?","Doug Lankler","Right. Yes, you asked whether it was gross or net. And the answer is it's a net number.","Manoj Garg","Okay.","Ian Read","That should do it.","Chuck Triano","That should do it. Thank you very much for your questions.","Ian Read","Thanks for your time everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2014 performance. I am joined today in New York by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance First Quarter 2014 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.","We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session. As we expect there will be questions related to our proposal to AstraZeneca and I would also note that there are limitations to place on our responses by the U.K. Takeover Code and to such there will be some questions we are not in a position to answer at this time.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you Chuck, and good morning everyone. During my remarks this morning, we will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some observations on how our strategy is progressing. Before discussing the quarter, I\u2019ll begin with a few words about the proposal we made to AstraZeneca to combine our two companies, and the rejection of our proposal by AstraZeneca\u2019s Board.","The proposal we announced publicly last Friday represented a substantial premium of 32% to AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders based on AstraZeneca\u2019s closing price of \u00a337.82 on the day before speculation began regarding a potential proposal at 39% premium to the closing price of \u00a335.86 on the day before our January proposal, and a 22% premium to the unaffected all-time high closing price since the formation of the company in 1999. This is an opportunity for AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders to realize near-term value creation well in excess of its standalone prospects as well as the opportunity to effectively trade up their AstraZeneca position for equity in the new combined company with far greater potential for value creation.","Up to this point, we\u2019ve only had access to publicly available information of AstraZeneca. Based on what we have learned through their information, we believe our revised proposal is compelling and responds to what we\u2019ve heard from their shareholders. We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interest of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer\u2019s shareholders that we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction that can be recommended by both our Boards. We would like to engage with AstraZeneca to gain a better understanding of their business and prospects. We believe they are an excellent strategic fit to Pfizer, and they have a strong and complementary alignment across and within our product portfolio and research platform.","That said, we remain very confident in our go-forward strategy regardless of a combination. We see this as further enhancing our strategy and consistent with creating shareholder value. Regardless of whether we complete this transaction, the main pillars of our strategy remain in place; namely focusing on innovation and advancing our pipeline, maximizing the productivity and returns generated within our commercial businesses, and remaining good stewards of our shareholders\u2019 capital. We believe that our formidable proposal merits serious consideration. Given our position and strength, we will remain disciplined as we move through this process.","Turning to our performance for the quarter, overall we continue to perform well in a challenging operating environment. Our financial performance was in line with our expectations. Revenues for the quarter reflected the continuing impact of product loss of exclusivity and the expiration or near-term termination of some collaborations, a disproportionate amount of about one third of the anticipated full-year impact was recorded in the first quarter. If you exclude that impact, we had 1% operational growth. We saw growth from many of our key revenue drivers including Lyrica, Xalkori, and Inlyta globally, Enbrel outside of the U.S. and Canada, recently launched products, Eliquis and Xeljanz in the U.S., and from our collaboration with Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan.","I would point out that our business has historically demonstrated seasonality of revenues, and this quarter was no different. In terms of product developments we reported positive results from Prevnar 13 CapiTA study in older adults, and announced FDA approvals including supplementary new drug applications for Xeljanz to include radiographic data in the label, and for Eliquis for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, as well as FDA approval of Nexium 24-hour for over-the-counter use for the treatment of frequent heartburn in adults 18 and over. And there were several positive elements in our pipeline, including positive results from a randomized Phase II study of palbociclib in combination with letrozole in first line treatment of ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. Positive results from a randomized Phase II study of bococizumab in the reduction of LDL cholesterol, and a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults.","For the full year revenue outlook, we anticipate key products will continue exhibiting growth, and that operational growth in emerging markets will be in the mid-single digit range rather than in the 3% range we saw in this quarter. Typically, our sequential annual product revenue pattern exhibits relative strength in the late quarters compared to our first quarter. For the balance of 2014, we anticipate incremental revenue contributions from Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 adult, Duavee and the expected launch of over-the-counter Nexium. As you know, at the beginning of this year, we implemented the new commercial operating structure to position the company for the future and to focus on maximizing growth.","We have three global operating segments; global innovative pharma, global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare and global established product pharma. These segments are fully functioning and are increasing the focus of management in providing greater transparency to shareholders and enhancing our ability to drive the business. As we previously committed to you, in today\u2019s earnings announcement, we provided the revenues and costs associated with each of these operating segments. In a few minutes, the leaders of each segment Geno Germano, Albert Bourla, and John Young, will provide you with additional context regarding the performance of their particular segment. While we have moved to this new operating structure, our overall focus and priorities have not changed. We remain focused on driving future value creation for shareholders by delivering innovative new products, maximizing the potential of our existing products, remaining diligent in terms of capital allocation, and driving a culture that continues to foster strong ownership environment.","Reflecting on the state of our business, I am pleased with our pipeline progress. We are continuing to see the benefit of the decisions we took over three years ago when we decided to focus our research and development in the areas where we have the most expertise and where the greatest unmet medical need exists. Looking at the compounds we have across all stages of our pipeline, I can confidently say that this part of our strategy is on track and gaining momentum. Similarly, our past and current steadfast focus on the prudent management of our capital is enhancing the overall competitiveness of our businesses. This quarter, once again we operationally reduced our adjusted cost of sales, adjusted S&I expenses, and adjusted R&D expense in total.","We will continue to build on our solid track record of realizing benefits from cost reductions and productivity initiatives, and as we\u2019ve done in the past we will use business development opportunities as an enabler of strategies for creating shareholder value. Overall, I believe we are performing well in a challenging operating environment. Our pipeline is advancing. We have a strong track record when it comes to using capital to generate value, and we have an engaged and motivated work force that has embraced the culture of ownership. Collectively, these are the elements of our strategy that are helping to drive our overall business results. Throughout this year, you will see us taking actions that execute on our plans to advance new therapies of patients, strengthen our commercial businesses, manage our cost structure, and deploy our capital in ways that yield the greatest value to our shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn over to Frank.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks Ian and good day everyone. As always the charts we are reviewing today are included in our Web cast. Before I begin I wanted to remind everyone that at the beginning of this year we began operating under our new commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, global innovative pharmaceuticals, global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare, and global established pharmaceuticals. Consequently, we are now reporting our quarterly and the annual P&L and the quarters with structure for all periods presented. I also want to remind everyone that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013 the financial results of the Animal Health business are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter 2013.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. First quarter 2014 revenues of approximately 11.4 billion decreased 9% year over year reflecting a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange and operational decline of approximately 6% driven mainly by the expiration on October 31, 2013 of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreements for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries continued erosion for branded Lipitor in the U.S. and most other developed markets, the loss of exclusivity in subsequent multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets. These were partially offset by the strong operational growth of Lyrica, Xalkori and Inlyta globally, Enbrel, outside of the U.S. and Canada, Eliquis and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. the contribution from the collaboration to market generic medicine in Japan with Mylan. In addition reported revenue included 57 million from transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 increased 12% primarily due to an aggregate operational decrease of 3% and adjusted cost of adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower effective tax rate and a few diluted weighted average share outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program and the impact of Zoetic exchange offer. Reported diluted EPS of $0.36 compared with $0.38 in the year ago quarter was positively impacted by the abovementioned items and lower restructuring and assets impairment charges compared at the year ago quarter.","Reported results were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned year-over-year decrease in revenues and the non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations associated with our Animal Business and the gain associated with the transfer of certain product rights to Pfizer\u2019s JV with Hisun in China in the year-ago and finally higher legal charges compared with the year ago quarter. And foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter revenues by 3% or $364 million and had a net positive impact of $195 million on the aggregate of logistic cost of sales adjusted SI&A expense and adjusted R&D expenses. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared the year ago quarter.","Now moving onto our 2014 financial guidance, historically our business has demonstrated seasonality of revenues and this quarter is no different. That said we\u2019re confirming all components of our adjusted 2014 financial guidance ranges and as such continue to expect our adjusted revenue to be in the range of $49.2 billion to $51.2 billion. We expect that the continued momentum from our new products including Prevnar 13 Adult, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Inlyta, and Xalkori. The expected launch of over-the-counter Nexium and the accelerating operational growth in emerging markets will help to mitigate the impact of product LOEs and losses of alliance revenue.","It\u2019s important to note that our adjusted financial guidance continues to reflect a full year contribution from Celebrex in the U.S. If necessary, we\u2019ll update our financial guidance when we\u2019re in a better position to make an informed judgment about the market exclusivity of Celebrex in the U.S. from May 30 through the end of this year. We\u2019d report to reported diluted EPS due to the applicability of the UK Takeover Code to our proposed combination with AstraZeneca, we\u2019re not currently permitted to confirm or update our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance which is our customary quarterly practice.","Preparation of certain reports by our reporting accounts financial advisors in accordance with the UK Takeover Code are currently underway. Because Pfizer recorded a number of charges during first quarter 2014 relating primarily to the resolution of litigation-related matters, Pfizer's previously-issued 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance is no longer valid. Updated reported diluted EPS guidance will be provided as soon as practicable.","As required by the UK Takeover Code, the Pfizer Responsible Officers including Ian, Doug Lankler, our General Counsel in May confirmed that the adjusted financial guidance provided has been properly compiled based on the same assumptions set out in the adjusted financial guidance issued on January 28, 2014 and prepared in accordance with the accounting policies of Pfizer.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the business leads Geno Germano, Albert Bourla, and John Young for the respective commentary and results for the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical\u2019s Global Vaccines and Oncology and Consumer Healthcare and Global Established Pharmaceutical, Geno?","Geno Germano","Thanks, Frank, and hello everyone. On the Global Innovative Pharma is our research driven biopharmaceutical business focused on developing and commercializing innovative new medicines. Our current portfolio consist of newly launched products including Eliquis and Xeljanz key in line brands including Lyrica outside of Europe and Enbrel outside of United States and Canada. In addition to the other products that we generally anticipate will maintain market exclusivity beyond 2015.","Our strategy involves making targeted investments to help grow our recently launched brands and other leading medicines in order to generate sustainable revenue growth overtime as well as making investments in R&D to support our next wave of innovative products. Well, some of these near term investment objectives include continuing to build on a momentum with Eliquis among cardiologist focusing on its differentiated clinical profile building on the efficacy profile of Xeljanz in the United States through promotion of the data regarding inhibition of structural damage that\u2019s now included in our labeling and also our mono-therapy indication.","Leveraging our presence in the women\u2019s health category to launch DUAVEE in the United States as a potential new standard of care from moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Continuing investment in direct to consumer advertising for Lyrica, Chantix and Viagra in the United States plus investment in growth market such as Japan. In supporting ongoing Phase III clinical studies for bococizumab, ertugliflozin and Xeljanz.","Now moving to the first quarter results for the Global Innovative Pharma segment. In the first quarter, revenue declined 4% operationally versus first quarter 2013 and this was largely due to the expiration of the Enbrel co-promotion term in the United States and Canada. Revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in Canada in February 2013 as well as some other smaller LOEs from prior periods. We excluded the impact of Enbrel in these LOEs underlying operational revenue growth was 10% driven primarily by continued growth of Xeljanz\u2019s Eliquis Enbrel outside of the United States and Canada and Lyrica outside of Europe.","Now I\u2019d like to review selected financial highlights for the Global Innovation Pharma segment. As a reminder, the revenues and expenses presented are those that were directly attributable to the GIP segment. First quarter 2014 income before taxes declined 5% operationally to $1.8 billion versus first quarter 2013. IBT as a percent of revenues on an operational basis declined modestly to 57.4%. Increased investment in recently launched brands and key in line products partially offset by benefits from cost reduction and productivity initiatives resulted in a 12% operational increase SI&A expenses compared to prior year quarter.","Our first quarter 2014 R&D expense grew 29% operationally compared to last year as we initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab and ertugliflozin and continued investment in our expensive clinical development program for potential new Xeljanz indications. Additionally IBT in the first quarter 2014 benefited from a significant increase and other income primarily due to trailing royalties earned on sales of Enbrel in the United States and Canada after October 31, 2013. On that date the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the United States and Canada expired and we became entitle to royalties for 36 month period. In conclusion we are excited about the GIP portfolio and our pipeline. We believe our focused investment strategy this year will drive sustained future revenue growth.","And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Albert Bourla to discuss the Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much Geno and hello everybody. Both these comprised of three separate distinct businesses, vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare, each poised for organic growth over time. We\u2019ve had an eventful year so far and have several significant milestones. First with vaccines, we presented positive results from Prevnar 13\u2019s CAPiTA trial at the major conference which clearly demonstrated that Prevnar 13 can prevent a significant portion of pneumococcal community acquire pneumonia in adults\u2019 age 65 and old. Evidence from this study is important for population in which age related decline of the immune system makes it difficult to prevent disease.","Hospitalizations due to pneumococcal pneumonia in adults represent a growing burden to public health systems. For example, the annual cost of adult hospitalization in the U.S. alone is estimated at $8 billion. We look forward to further discussing this data with regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees to help inform decisions regarding Prevnar 13 label and recommendation of the age. Regarding ACIP we have had productive interim discussion with pneumococcal working group. We are prepared for more formal ACIP presentation in June should the CDC confirm that topic in their agenda. Second, in vaccines again, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation of our vaccine for meningitis B, a disease that is characterized by rapid onset with high rates of fatality. We intend to a BLA with the FDA by mid-2014.","Moving to oncology, we presented positive results palbociclib\u2019s PALOMA-1 trial at the major conference. We are very pleased with the results which highlight the potential for palbociclib to become a new standard of care for women with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. This is encouraging information for these women who represent approximately 60% of the advanced breast cancer population. We\u2019ve continued to have productive and ongoing discussions with the FDA about this data as well as the other necessary supporting data for a new drug application. We continue to envision its potential by way to filing an NDA based on the PALOMA-1 data. Although, no decision has been made. Once one has been made we will communicate it public.","We also begun those in patients in two additional Phase III trials one in recurrent advanced breast cancer and one in early breast cancer and next we reported positive results for the Xalkori compare to chemotherapy in the first line setting for all positive non-small cell lung cancer. Final with consumer health care, we receive FDA approval for Nexium 24HR for over-the-counter use. This approval represents the first significant milestone in executing our Rx to OTC strategy. The U.S. launch is set for May 27. We also continue to advance promising candidates to position the next wave of potential innovative launches including the C. difficile and staph oral vaccines as well as our small inhibitor for hematologic cancers.","Now let\u2019s go the VOC first quarter results. For this quarter VOC segment delivered revenues of $2.2 billion which represent an increase of 1% operationally versus Q1 2013. Please note that the revenues and expenses presented are those that were directly attributable to the VOC segment. Revenues for vaccines increased 2% operationally driven by the U.S. primarily reflecting government purchasing orders. Internationally, revenues were flat operational with emerging markets growing at 14% rate driven primarily by China and gavi (ph) purchases but essentially offset by declines in the UK and Canada.","Oncology revenues increased 10% due to growth for new products Xalkori and Inlyta partially offset primarily by changes in Sutent buying patterns in certain markets. Consumer health care revenues declined 3% operationally due to a soft cough, cold, flu season in the U.S. and Canada in comparison with the same period last year. Extreme winter weather negatively impacting retail traffic in the U.S. and increased competition for our group with the return of certain brands to the market; however, it is important to note that as the year progresses we anticipate revenues to be positively impacted as more healthcare providers appreciate the value of the Prevnar 13 adult indication. Of course the therefore potential will depend upon updated labels and recommendation of the seasons. Additionally we expect revenues to be positively impacted by the launch of Nexium 24HR and other consumer products the timing of certain national immunization programs and continued uptake of recently launched products in oncology among other factors.","I would like now to walk you through a few additional highlights from the VOC segment finance as typically regarding our income and our direct managed expenses. VOC segment income before taxes was 1.1 billion or 48.6% of our revenue. This represents an improvement of 2.8% points operationally. Our gross margin was 1.8 billion or 81.2% of revenue, an improvement of 0.8% points compared to the year ago quarter. Due to a greater percentage year coming from our Oncology and Vaccines business as well as further cost efficiencies in manufacturing.","SI&A expenses were $531 million, this represents a 2% increase operationally primarily due to prelaunch expenses for Nexium; however, as a percentage of revenues our SI&A expense has remained consistent year-over-year. The VOC R&D expenses were $184 million which represents an 18% decrease due to the completion of certain Phase III trials which more than offset incremental costs related to the expansion of the palbociclib clinical development program.","Thank you and I will now hand it over to John Young, Group President of the Global Established Pharmaceutical segment.","John Young","Thank you, Alert, and good morning everyone. Global Established Pharma is a large and highly diverse business with unique opportunities across portfolios and geographies. It\u2019s a significant cash generator and its Pfizer\u2019s largest business. For the first quarter of 2014 the GEP business accounted for just over half of Pfizer\u2019s total revenue and about two thirds of Pfizer\u2019s total revenue from the emerging markets comes from GEP. Notably during the first quarter, emerging markets comprised nearly 30% of the GEP segment revenues. Contributed to some perceptions of this business traditional commodity generic products in develop markets are actually very small part of the GEP portfolio. And it came through in May by 5% of GEP revenues.","We see our GEP strategic priorities as two fold, one is optimized the financial performance of the decline in components in the developed markets. And two focus on the current and future areas of growth and reversing the decline in trend. I am not optimizing the business margins over the mid to longer term.","Before I get into the details of the GEP performance of quarter one, I\u2019d like to give a quick overview of the business and have it structured. GEP is comprised of three components I have different market dynamics. Two of these components are in the developed markets. First, Peri-LOE includes major brands have recently aloft or are approaching a lots of exclusivity. Such as, Celebrex, Lyrica in Europe, Zyvox, Pristiq and Detrol.","Secondly legacy established products include mature off pattern products such as Lipitor and Novex and we also have targeted opportunities that exist in this product grouping. We expect to see a decline in both of these areas, featuring tense erosion from generic competition. However, we will continue to focus on growing the patterned brands prior to the loss of market exclusivity, as well as to optimize the transactions of brands to the off pattern stage and extend their life beyond LOE.","The third component is the emerging markets including the BRIC-MT markets. This includes all GEP product sold in emerging countries and growth opportunities in emerging markets including the BRIC-MT\u2019s. This component is expected to grow steadily driven by favorable macro-economic and improving social-economic conditions in these countries.","Growth opportunities represents fourth dynamic of the GEP business, that includes organic and inorganic initiatives such as partnerships product enhancements and are by similar portfolio spanning both developed and emerging markets. We anticipate these opportunities will drive revenue growth and legacy EP developed and emerging markets portfolios overtime.","Now let\u2019s go to the GEP first quarter results. For this quarter GEP delivered revenues of $6 billion which represents of 10% decline operationally, the Peri-LOE products in developed markets experienced an overall decline of 17% operationally. Due to lots of exclusivity and subsequent multi store generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and for Viagra in most European markets, as well as the determination of the co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan and the decline in our share of revenues resulting from the winder determination of this three our co-promotion agreement for certain markets.","However it\u2019s important to note that certain pattern protected products have shown positive operational growth including Lyrica in Europe, Pristiq in the U.S. and developed international as well as Inspira in developed international markets. Our legacy established product in developed markets experienced a 10% operational decline from early due to the continued share erosion by generic versions of Lipitor in the U.S. in most developed international markets.","The legacy emerging markets increased 1% operationally, growth was negatively impacted by certain onetime of shares under moving this operational growth would have been 4% driven by BRIC-MT markets. The growth opportunities increased 10% operationally driven primarily by contributions from the collaboration with Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan and Quillivant XR sales in the U.S.","These growth opportunities performance is reflected in the previously mentioned operational results of legacy established products in the emerging markets components. The revive one final metric for how we measure GEP\u2019s underlying performance, expiring alliance product to LOE and Lipitor in developed markets. The operational revenue decline in the first quarter 2014 for the remaining 92% of GEP\u2019s portfolio was 2%, other post to 10% for the segment overall.","I\u2019ll now walk you through a few additional highlights from GEP financials and we\u2019ll explains what it\u2019s driving some of the rations and how I see them revolving. In terms of the ratios, obviously speaking to our direct managed expenses relative to our revenues, income before taxes that is directly attributable to GEP was $4 billion in the first quarter 2014 or almost 68% of GEP\u2019s revenue.","This represents and improvements of 1.7 percentage points on an operational basis. Our gross margin as $5 billion, or 83% of revenue this is representative of the portfolio profile of the GEP business that is mainly composed to pushed LOE on Peri-LOE brands with a smaller contribution from generics. As large brands with market exclusivity this gross margin will come under pressure.","GEP, SINA expenses were $837 million in the quarter this represented a 20% operational decrease and it\u2019s primarily driven by the increased sale force expenses in the both develop and emerging markets, as well as resource allocation favoring higher growth opportunities within the emerging markets. This 20% reduction also reflects a favorable onetime item this quarter related to administrative expenses. We will continue make SI&A expense discipline a focus of the management of our business. The GEP R&D expenses for the quarter are 2.3% revenue and represent a 23% operational decline. This is the result of focused reductions in operational expenses, partially offset by higher spending for clinical trials associated with the development of our biosimilars portfolio. Moving forward we expect to increase investment in those assets that have entered and will enter Phase III. In summary, while GEP is expected to go through a period of revenue decline over the next few years primarily due to the LOEs of major brands in developed markets. We are focused on building our revenue base and stabilizing margins over the mid to longer term and following the period of anticipated LOEs we expect revenue growth to return other growth opportunities become a more substantial piece of the GEP business in the future. Thank you and I\u2019d now like to hand it back to Frank.","Frank D'Amelio","","Thanks, John. Now moving on to key takeaways our first quarter 2014 results were in line with our expectations with effective loss of exclusivity of certain products, the expiration in near term terminations of certain collaboration agreements and a continued challenging operating environment. We confirmed all components of our 2014 adjusted financial guidance which continues to reflect the full year contribution with Celebrex in the US, we\u2019re now operating under our new commercial structure and presentation of our financial results for the new structure provides transparency and to each of our global segments, with respect to our late stage R&D pipeline we achieved a statistically significant primary endpoint resulting in our PALOMA-1 Phase II breast cancer study of Palbociclib and began dosing patients for two Phase III breast cancer trials and we presented positive results of our CAPiTA trial which demonstrated Prevenar 13 prevented a first episode of vaccine type community acquired pneumonia in adults 65 years or older. We continue to create shareholder value through a prudent capital allocation. Today the 2014 we\u2019ve repurchased $1.7 billion or approximately 54.3 million shares and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock this year. Finally we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","","Chuck Triano","","Thanks, Frank and I want to thank the audience for listening, I know the prepared remarks were longer than typical but given it was the first quarter with the new financials for the segments we wanted to give our business leaders some time to walk through their segments and the financials. We\u2019ll get ready for the Q&A session and I think I would just reiterate once more related to questions regarding AstraZeneca we will limitations placed on the responses by the UK takeover code. With that operator, if we could please poll for questions, thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","","Good morning Frank thanks a lot for taking the question. If I could just throw one at you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten this in all kinds of one-on-one meetings, but it might be good just to address it again. You know the big concern I guess about the AZ deal or proposed deal is that you guys obviously think there\u2019s something wrong with Pfizer if Pfizer wasn\u2019t able to acquire AstraZeneca, so I was just wondering, Ian or Frank, if I could just get a general reaction to that. And then number two, the Street as I understand, it is currently modeling pretty dramatic revenue decreases for GEP as well as more modest decreases for GIP over the long term, and I heard in the prepared remarks you talked about a return to growth in GEP and I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and help us out. I know you did a little bit, but I\u2019d appreciate some more color if possible. And then finally, an easy one for Frank, since you have 2013 segment information at least for the 1Q 13 in the press release, is there any chance that those numbers could be audited such that that would become year one? Thank you very much.","Ian Read","","Thank you Mark for your one question, you know I think we\u2019ve gone out of our way to say that this, I see this AZ deal as a way to accelerating an already good strategy. I think we\u2019ve gone at pains in this release to point out the exciting developments in our pipeline, the evolution of fixing of any core, the way we return value to shareholders, and so I definitely feel that we did this out of position of strength. In fact we having approached AZ in December and having received a negative from them in confidential conversations decided to wait until we had results of Palbociclib and adult vaccine, so that if we came back into the market it would be seen as we\u2019re coming back from a position of strength. So, you know we will continue to operate our business, continue to drive shareholder value and feel very confident about our standalone strategies. I\u2019m going to ask John to talk a little bit about GEP, and I believe it was interesting enough in GEP when you took out the loss of exclusivity or loss of the deal with Amgen you know and other small LOEs, it was 10% growth which is a really good growth in that area, solid in that area. John, regarding GEP.","","John Young","So, thanks for your question Mark, I think we\u2019ve -- certainly in my prepared remarks and in the meetings that we\u2019ve had with the analyst community, one of the things that we\u2019ve been very clear on is that we knew that in the short to medium term, we will see pressure on revenues as we experience losses of exclusivity from some of the major brands in our portfolio that are either already post LOE and are still coming under pressure, so brands would include Lipitor falling into that bucket or some of the major brands that we have in our portfolio that have yet to lose exclusivity but will do so over the coming few months and years, so brands like Lyrica in EU, like Celebrex in the U.S., like Zyvox and so on.","So to be clear we certainly know that this is a business portfolio which will come under revenue pressure in the short to medium term. But in the medium to longer term we certainly see our revenues plateauing and having the opportunity to return to growth, and the underlying drivers for that opportunity that we see in the medium term would include our biosimilars portfolio. We believe we\u2019re going to have a strong biosimilars portfolio of we hope ultimately five biosimilars that we will aim to bring to market. Clearly, the landscape for that type of portfolio in the regulatory environment is still evolving, but we have regulators that have clarified the regulatory pathway. We actually believe that as a very positive opportunity for growth.","And additionally, we see the opportunities for growth with this portfolio in some of the emerging markets including China as an example, but not limited to China, remain very positive. Our China business continues to perform well. And additionally, we see additional opportunities for growth with certain key partnerships such as Hisun in China and our Teuto partnership. So when we put all of those things together, whilst in the short to medium term we certainly will see continued pressure on revenues in the medium to long term, we do believe that this business does have a number of underlying factors which will enable us to return to growth in the medium to long term, so hopefully that answers your question Mark.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Thank you, Frank.","Frank D'Amelio","And Mark, no change from what I\u2019ve said previous. 2014 year one, three years prospective audited financials, and I think the key here is remember audited financials require more than an income statement. They require a balance sheet, a cash flow statement, another comprehensive income statement, and the shareholders equity statement. So, no change from what I\u2019ve said previously.","Chuck Triano","Thanks Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. Good morning, Ian and Frank, and the rest of the team. I just had two questions. First, with respect to Xeljanz obviously the competitive landscape will evolve down the line, but you\u2019ve talked about driving greater uptake, could you just comment on why you wouldn\u2019t consider discounting more to drive greater share? Obviously, the plans are using safety concerns to limit formulary adoption in an attractive Tier 2 status position, but really the plans obviously get tremendous rebates on Humira and Enbrel, so I guess I am just wondering how we should think about the pricing strategy for Xeljanz and if pricing can be a greater lever to driver greater uptake? And I guess just a follow on to that is since you\u2019ve asked for just one question, could you just update us on the once a day formulation development and filing timing? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, David. Geno could you take those questions?","Geno Germano","Yes, and obviously Dave we\u2019re keenly aware of the kind of pricing and access and reimbursement environment for Xeljanz and then frankly in the whole class of biologics for RA and have run all the scenarios and frankly at this point in time we think the best thing to do is to continue to build on the positive profile that we\u2019re seeing with Xeljanz the data from our Phase III studies from our long term extension now we have the structured data in our label. We have positive outcomes from patient reported outcomes analysis and we think that that will give us the strength that we need with physicians and with payers to continue to grow the business. We saw a nice increase from fourth quarter of \u201913 to the first quarter this year with a 16% uptick in prescriptions and we continue to gather momentum. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that. With regard to the once a day we are putting the data together and I believe we\u2019re planning to file next year.","Chuck Triano","Thanks Geno. Next question please operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much, and I appreciate all the business unit details it\u2019s very helpful to understand the company here. So two questions, the first was if you actually split your business into three standalone entities can you quantify how much more operating expense or dyssynergy the company would incur I think which would be a helpful data point as the street looks to value your various business units? My second question is just managing the company in this business structure it\u2019s been four months. Maybe the business unit leaders could you just talk about what they\u2019re finding in terms of the strategy and expense structure of the business. I guess my question is should we think about are there incremental cost cutting or updated strategic priorities for one of more of these units over time as the new management teams kind of further review their franchises or is everybody pretty comfortable in terms of how the business that they\u2019re positioned today and how they\u2019re being managed? Thanks very much.","Ian Read","So Chris on this idea of three segments I think I would sort of withdraw the market to the view that there are actually two major segments inside the company. There is an innovative core and there is an Established Products and as we look to the future optionality, I'll be more focused on that and looking at multiple businesses with multiple dissynergies. So we don't really think there's any material dissynergies, if these businesses were to be standalone or these two segments, in fact, we think that management focus overcomes those types of dissynergies. And on the, sort of getting at this stage given we've taken so long with prepared remarks, I'm really going to just say that I think we feel that we've laid by our opening comments the major strategies of these businesses and during the year it will be ample time I think for the business unit leaders to have conversations with you. Frank, do you want to add something to that?","Frank D'Amelio","Yeah. Just a couple of quick things on the first point, Ian on the standalone to respond to Chris. Chris, we gave you all the detail we could relative to kind of the direct managed and then the allocated piece with the big chunks of the allocated piece being research and development through PAC, medical and then corporate centers, so finance, IT, those kinds of functions. In terms of hypothetically, if they were separate companies, there'd be some incremental cost, right? There's one CFO in the company today. They'd each need their own CFO and they'd each need their own General Counsel. So, there'd be those kinds of incremental costs. Then, we didn't assign any of the interest expense or the interest income to the businesses either. We left it out of the allocation. So, there's some items clearly that would be incremental if they were to be standalone but to Ian's point, I don't think there's anything that would be really material to those being standalone.","Ian Read","That\u2019s correct. Well, our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs: Just a couple. On Prevnar 13, you had mentioned that the next ACIP meeting is June. What are the potential outcomes of that meeting? I would assume that the most realistic outcome given the results of CAPiTA would be that the, the Prevnar 13 would be included in the 65 and older mandated vaccination schedule, if you could confirm that? And then, just one other question or rather two other questions on the new business structure. Ian, how does the business development process work in the context of the new structure? So, if VOC wants to make an acquisition or GIP or GEP, I may have gotten those wrong, wanted to make acquisitions, are they competing with each other for capital? How do you assess which of the three groups get capital to make acquisitions? And just finally Frank, I noticed when you broke down the three businesses that there is a very large R&D expense, $896 million allocated under Other. How do we think about that Other business? How do we allocate that across the three businesses?","Ian Read","Well, Jami, thank you for the questions. I'm going to just answer the Prevnar 13, because I think we're -- to say -- we took a long time in the prepared remarks, they will consider in June. Normally, the usual practice is for ACIP to have two meetings, one to debate and then the second meeting they would vote on. They may decide to short-step that in June and both discuss and vote but the normal pattern would be a discussion in June and then a vote in October. Albert do you want to add anything to that or is that fine? ","Albert Bourla","That's fine. It's not unprecedented what they have done it one\u2026","Ian Read","It's unprecedented -- we're working with them. The data was really good, but we're working with the agencies as hard as we can to get them to see and get excited about this data. On BD, how it works is? That there is a corporate cost of capital and BD is run corporately, in essence each business unit will have projects that they bring forward to the corporation. Competition for capital is not necessarily -- we're not necessarily limited in capital. There's a competition for good ideas and best returns. And I think the most important thing of this structure is that it puts the business leaders on the accountability side of the projects they want to get funding for. So I think it clears up and makes it very, very -- it's good governance that inside the company now, a BUD that says I want to do this project and I stand by it and I'm a champion by it and the accountability attached is which I think brings a great judgment and a great discipline to capital allocation. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?","Frank D'Amelio","No. I was going to answer Jami's third question on the ecos, I don't have anything to add on the business dev point. Jami, I think, the best way for me to explain this is to point you into the certain pages of the release and just quickly walk you through it, if that's okay. So, if you go to Chart number 18, you'll see up on the top quarter ended March 30th, 2014,and there's a column called Other and in that column called Other, there's an R&D expense line which amounts to $896, which is the number you quoted. If you go to the next page and you go to the tables on the bottom, but the one higher up on Page 19 you'll see the $896 off to the far right column and then you'll see the breakdown of that between the different organizations. Then if you go to the next page and you go to the table again, but the bottom three numbers, you'll see in the last number there, research and development expenses and you see how we give percentage ranges to drive at each of the BU. So we try to provide drill down for you all so you could see how we take the numbers and then how we drill them down and we gave you ranges of allocation to enable to you to do that by position.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Thanks for taking my question. I don\u2019t know what to answer this to, but obviously AstraZeneca in terms of its statements has pushed back around valuation to mix of cash and equity and also execution risk. Would characterize conversations you\u2019ve had with shareholders voicing similar concerns or perhaps there is a slight different perception as you go around asking about that? And just another side question, just on GEP, I wonder if you could breakdown the current R&D spending in terms of what would be on newer projects such as biosimilars and what might be associated most of the older based business products? Thank you.","Ian Read","We listen to the shareholders and we thought it was a compelling offer which fully valued AZ and we\u2019re waiting commentary back or further commentary back from AZ. On the R&D I\u2019m giving you quite a lot of statistics in the backup pages for you to allocate R&D, but perhaps John, do you want to make a couple of comments on the main sort of around spending gap?","John Young","Yes. Obviously, the precedent we don\u2019t sort of go into detail on the sort of breakdown of R&D expenses in overall. I think what I\u2019ve mentioned, Jeff, in my sort of opening comments, is that, that obviously includes operational expenses for the business unit as a whole and also includes the expenses for the development of the biosimilars portfolio. I think at this point that\u2019s probably is as much detail as I can give.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink","So first question for Frank and then the second question is actually on Prevnar 13. Frank, can you just talk about your cash and borrowing capacity and remind us what your current reading is and what the difference in the borrowing costs might be from the current rating to a single step down in the rating? Then separately as we think about Prevnar 13 and the adult indication, obviously there has been quite a bit of impressive data already accrued in terms of the herd immunity that we have already seen presented to the ACIP. I am just wondering, if you could help us understand that in terms of the evaluation of Prevnar 13 particularly in international markets and the willingness for national immunization programs to pay for the adult indication? Then just a last question on Prevnar 13, the ACIP also reviewed a possibility of a three dose schedule for Prevnar 13. Can you just update us quickly on how a three dose schedule might actually evolve or if that\u2019s a very unlikely situation or if the product is already being used mostly at a three dose schedule?","Ian Read","Okay, so I will ask Frank to answer the cash and borrowing and costs and then will ask Albert to take the Prevnar adult and the ACIP three dose question.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So Seamus let me start with on the current ratings with S&P - I\u2019ll do long-term ratings first; S&P were AA. Moody\u2019s were A1, Fitch were an A plus. On the short-term ratings with S&P we\u2019re at A1 plus, with Moody\u2019s we\u2019re at P1, with Fitch we\u2019re in F1. In terms of cash and borrowing capacity, the end of last year [audio gap] dollars, obviously given that, given our ratings, we have a significant amount of borrowing capacity and in terms of a change in rating, well that due to our borrowing cost. Obviously, you got to make assumptions without notches, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be any material notch change. So whatever changes they were would not be material. And quite frankly, if you look at the capital markets these days and investment grade paper it\u2019s a very favorable market.","Albert Bourla","Let me start first with the herd effect and then I will speak about the dosing schedule. While Prevnar 13 has led to substantial reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal disease, the residual disease burden in the U.S. and globally is still significant. Even a decade after the introduction in the infant program, in U.S. alone, there are 440,000 cases of non-bacterial pneumococcal pneumonia. They account for 300,000 hospitalizations, 200,000 emergency room visits, and unfortunately 90,000 deaths. And globally, WHO has also similar estimation. 600,000 to 800,000 adult annual deaths due to septa caused pneumonia which is the leading cause of cough.","We need to understand that the scientific community and us of course do not regard the herd effect as an alternative to direct vaccination. So in summary, we believe that the vaccination with Prevnar 13 represents a compelling value proposition for healthcare systems around the world. Moving now on the dose schedule. First of all, we support the continued scientific exchange on the topic, but having said that, we have a vaccine schedule in the U.S. that has demonstrated success, and we believe that this clinically proven FDA approved CDC recommended four dose schedule is the optimal way to protect the U.S. infants and young children from pneumococcal disease and also we believe there are no data in the U.S. population to make a decision to divert from this four dose schedule, that it is proven to be so successful.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert. From my point of view and I think from society's point of view, the Prevenar 13 vaccination schedule delivers considerable value and we see that value to society in the overall treatment and don't necessarily really look at it as a per dose cost. It's more an overall value delivered by the protection. Mike, do you want to add a little bit about the herd effect?","Mikael Dolsten ","Albert described it very well and I could just comment, kind of one clinical aspect, what we learned in Netherlands is that when we typed the serotypes from the pneumonia and IPD cases, which was possible by a proprietary assay that we have developed, it was nicely shown that a significant fraction, about a quarter of the cases requires to serotypes from the regional Prevenar to 7-valent which clearly shows that although there has been immunization, there is a residual serotypes remaining in the population and herd effect is not sufficient to protect. Finally, I just want to add a medical aspect that - with increasing age you're more susceptible to severe outcomes and increased fatality, first by age, underlining the importance that Albert alluded to, to get the campaign rather earlier than later in adults for protection.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Boris from Suntrust.","John Boris - Suntrust","Thanks for taking the question. Just first question is for Frank, when we look retrospectively at the last big breakup that we had which was Abbott spinning off AbbVie, when we look back at that transaction there was some dilution that was associated with it. By our math, the breakup of the two companies was about 15% dilutive in retrospect to what the separate companies would have earned if they'd stayed as one. In this instance, you're breaking up into three. What is the potential dilutive effect operationally and potentially from any tax leakage by breaking the entity up into three different businesses? Second question, just for Ian, you indicated in your opening comments that once you had the palbo data and the Prevenar data that, that positioned you at least from a position of strength to be able to go back to AZN. Is your assumption that on palbo that you'll be able to file in '14 and then launch in '15 and are you assuming you're going to get a universal vaccination recommendation on Prevenar going forward, and is that the position of strength that you're coming at this from?","Ian Read ","Thank you, you know on this whole issue of Abbott and AbbVie, we really can't comment on how they went about restructuring and what expenses they incurred and what dilution they incurred. I do believe though just from memory that, that, I think if you took the value of the two separate companies after they did this and you stripped out general market movement, they still created many billions of dollars of value. So, I think that's a more important issue than the dilution or the small incremental cost of the separate companies. By the way, as I've tried to reemphasize, John, we are not talking about -- if we are -- there's no decision been taken regardless of separating these companies, and certainly, we are not talking about of three or four ways split, we are talking about two major segments, just to emphasize that. On this question of yours on position of strength, I was not trying to assume any action on the part of the FDA or the ACIP panel, I was just talking about the strength of the data and the data is compelling and that one would expect the marketplace to follow the data. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you, couple of questions that are both merger related. What things do you think that a merged Pfizer and Astra can do better than Astra alone? In other words, what do you see as potential weaknesses of Astra standalone business either in terms of product mix or R&D abilities or geographic positioning or anything else? Then, I want to go back to a question I asked on the call you guys did last week just to confirm or reconfirm Pfizer's intentions assuming it acquires Astra, is it again most likely that you would take the post-merger entity and eventually split it up completely into separate publically traded companies because it's kind of a different story if the answer to that is no. So, I guess I am just looking for some continued assurances here and not promises but rather what's most likely or is there something about in version and re-domiciling in the U.K. that would make a full split-up like that more difficult?","Ian Read","Yes. So I think if you look from our point of view, if you look at AZ and it's my view not their view, so I am talking of my view of their strategy, not their view of their strategy that they have had a strategy of confronted with massive LOEs. They have gone out and they have licensed in and brought in lots of products from other companies. In fact, most of their pipeline is licensed in products with very few developed nationally. But -- so we look at that and we look it to fit with our portfolio, especially immune Oncology area, where they have assets which standalone or probably coming late to the market, but if they were combined with our portfolio, I think it strengthened their portfolio substantially. And then when you look at their products, they fit into our categories. So we believe that with our marketing presence and our ability in those categories, we can make more out of those products that they can standalone. But the power of this deal for us is these three components, it\u2019s the fit on the portfolio; it's a nice fit with the early pipeline, but it's not a pipeline story per se. It's also a removing of overlaps and making the organization more efficient. And I do believe you\u2019re seeing, you will continue to see a trend in the industry towards as governments pressurize on access and pricing, they are really telling the industry you need to get more efficient, you need to bring to market higher value products at a lower cost and there are ways -- different ways of doing that, there\u2019s internal improvements in your efficiencies which Pfizer has done and been very effective at. There is asset swaps as you saw going on between GSK and Novartis, which also gets to -- getting companies to remove overlaps or there is industry consolidation which -- this would be an example of that. And then the third component of value here which is really important for Pfizer is its ability to free the balance sheet up and get our tax rate down, which would enable a lot of different strategies. And so all three of these elements are important, I've been asked would you do it if you didn't have this part or you didn't have that part? I mean the answer is I'm doing it because I have all three parts and it strengthens our strategy right now and creates I believe compelling shareholder value. I would say on your other question that we are interested in preserving optionality that we've set up. We would see the integration of AstraZeneca with Pfizer along the way that we are organized. We would preserve that optionality. We would focus on managing those businesses as efficiently as possible and no decision has been taken about the future as there's been no decision taken about our businesses at this moment in time, but we would conserve that optionality.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Ian. Next question please.","Operator","You next question come from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","There\u2019s couple of things. First, you had mentioned last time on the call about palbo that you were going to be meeting with the FDA. I just wanted to know if that meeting actually had taken place, if you have it scheduled yet. I was a little unclear about your comments on palbo there. Second, the meningitis B vaccine, when will we see the data? And then three, on biosimilars can you just remind us of when will we start to see data from the studies there, these pivotal Phase IIIs and filings start to occur? Thanks.","Ian Read","Okay. Thank you. On palbo, it is scheduled. It is extremely imminent and once we've had that meeting and once we have any confirmation from the FDA, we will let you know, but we're still in discussions with the FDA. On Mening B, I don't know who's the best here -- Mikael, do you have the data or there\u2019s\u2026?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. I can just mention that, we are in the process of sharing data at conferences. It includes experiences from our Phase I, Phase II and dosing schedules and also they're recording data, strong data on combining Mening B with vaccines that are used in these age groups, such as GARDASIL or the typical adolescence vaccines, different schedules in Europe and U.S., hence we would present soon at the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases and later in this fall, corresponding U.S. presentation too.","Ian Read","Thank you. John, biosimilars?","John Young","So, we'll get back to you with some specifics on our plans for presentation of the data. I mean, just to remind you, we have two of our portfolio, which are in Phase III, we have rituxumab, which initiated a Phase III or initiates Phase III in second half of this year. We have trastuzumab where Phase III has already been initiated. So, rituxumab will go into Phase III in second half of the year, trastuzumab is already there. So, it'll be some time before we see the readout of those studies, but we'll get back to you separately in regard to your question about when any plans to present any other of our Phase I data.","Ian Read","Yeah. Thank you and I would say internally that Mikael is very satisfied with the profile that we're exhibiting and the ability to say that is biosimilar and we're very pleased with the science we have and the capabilities around this development area.","Chuck Triano","Right. We can move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen","Thank you. I have three brief one. First, why is stage R&D such a high percent of the total, 56% of R&D is unallocated to any division, which seems high versus your peers. Second is there still uncertainty around Celebrex U.S. sales from May 30th to the end of the year given the settlements? And then lastly, Ian, are you willing to give any assurances of limited R&D cuts in U.S. like you did in the U.K.? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you. Could we do, first of all the -- yes, the early stage and the allocation algorithm there and then dub you on through the uncertainty?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So, I think the best way to answer this Steve is the way we manage the organization, which is all of the post-POC R&D spend is in the business units, the new operating segments, the pre-POC R&D spend. So all the discovery, the research up and through inclusive of POC is in Mikael Dolsten\u2019s organization WRD. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the other column. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that. So that\u2019s why you get the split that we currently have.","Geno Germano","Yes, so on Celebrex both Mylan and Actavis have sued the FDA having concluded that FDA will give Teva, 180 days exclusivity. They believe that unless the courts overseeing those suits rule in Mylan and Actavis\u2019 favor and change FDA\u2019s ruling that Teva is going to have exclusivity. We previously settled with Teva and as part of that settlement the earlier stage Teva can launch December 2014 their exclusivity would begin then.","Ian Read","Frank do you want to add to that?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Just -- and I should have mentioned partner alliance too, regulatory toxicology all those kinds of things Pharm Sci are all in that other column as well.","Ian Read","So, on your question about the integration of the two companies, I think we\u2019ve made some commitments to the combined Company\u2019s presence in the U.K. and we clearly will stay with a massive presence in the U.S. as a combined Company.","Operator","The next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","On the VOC unit, Albert, you mentioned these are really three different businesses kind of blended into one. Can you just talk about that one specifically in terms of the synergies and overlaps you see that may give or probably keep them all as one unit as opposed to being structured maybe differently? And then second just on the consumer side, you\u2019ve highlighted the news around Nexium 24HR always have some displaying news for your singular potential being in OTC product, just given your -- you\u2019ve been generally bullish on the Rx OTC switch opportunity, how important do you see to have consumer business internally to be able to profit from that opportunity as opposed to maybe do alliances with other companies that might have consumer if you didn\u2019t have one yourself?","Ian Read","Vamil, thank you for the questions. First question remind me again was on\u2026","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","The three separate\u2026","Ian Read","Well, look, see, these units are independent global units that are run basically separately. I think any type of -- and Albert is a very experienced business leader and has three division heads reporting to him. Any type of synergies between those businesses is more of the nature of managerial talent and leveraging strategies across great leaders and not really address towards synergizing the operational infrastructure those businesses, as all these things, they are global and they have their own culture and their own focus which is part of the reason why we made them global businesses. On the other side, from the point of view of the corporation, consumer business is an important business for us. We see there\u2019s a great store of value. We\u2019ve made acquisitions in that business, and the OTC strategy is a component of the value of that business. But we are not just managing that business only because we have an OTC strategy. We see acquisitions as part of that strategy and switches and organic growth and freshness index in the business and continuing to make sure that business grows. Thank you for the question.","Unidentified Company Representative","And we have time for our last question please, operator.","Operator","Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei fro BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Ian at one point would you consider going directly to the AstraZeneca shareholders. You mentioned a premium that you are offering plus as well as your disappointment by the company\u2019s lack of engagement. Then on the pipeline and approaching AstraZeneca from a position of strength, other than palbo and Prevnar 13 in adults, what are the other key assets that you believe may not be adequately appreciated by the Street? Thank you.","Ian Read","We\u2019ve made public our offer to the Board. We remain considering all our options on how we progress these discussions. I think on our -- you are talking about our pipeline, I think you have got PCSK9 which is we will arrive at the market, we expect roughly at the same time as the other major competitors in that with outcomes data. We have palbo, we have all the trials around palbo, Prevnar 13 adult. We have got the mening B. We have got the SGLT2 ertugliflozin with Merck. We have the Xeljanz life extensions around that. Around that continuing growth in Eliquis, continuing growth in Xeljanz, continuing growth in Oncology portfolio and in Inlyta and Xalkori, some very good fast following products in Oncology that could come to market, given we think they are very differentiated. So frankly opportunities abound inside our Company both from the inline portfolio, the emerging markets opportunities, the pipeline recent launches and to be launched and then if you look at the sort of across of vaccines, Oncology and give a very nice portfolio of unique opportunities. So, as I say, we're doing this because we see an opportunity create additional value from this acquisition or combination not because we feel any negativity towards our present strategy which we feel is very strong. Okay, thank you.","Chuck Triano","Thank you everybody for your time today.","Frank D'Amelio ","Thanks everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Pfizer's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2015 performance. As usual, I'm joined by: our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide R&D; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Second Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentation section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our current report on Form 8-K dated today.","We'll now make some prepared remarks and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter, provide some comments on key areas of focus in the pipeline, and close with a few words about business development and the pending Hospira acquisition.","Starting with the quarter, it was another quarter of strong operational performance. For the third consecutive quarter, we saw operational revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite LOE headwinds. We continue to see solid revenue growth from our newer products as a result of the investments we are making R&D and our commercial operations. Specifically in the second quarter as compared to same period last year, ELIQUIS alliance revenues nearly tripled on a global basis, and XELJANZ revenues nearly doubled.","PREVNAR 13 revenue in the U.S. increased 87%, primarily due to continued strong uptake in PREVNAR 13 in adults, with most of the growth in the overall PREVNAR 13 franchise coming from the adult indication in this quarter. We have done an excellent job for the first half of this year of getting to patients and capturing the potential of PREVNAR 13 in adults in the U.S., as evidenced by the outstanding year-to-date performance which has been primarily driven by the catch-up opportunity. Over the next few years, we believe this catch-up opportunity in the U.S. will be robust. However, we will likely need to expend more effort to reach these individuals, and the opportunity will moderate over time as the catch-up opportunity becomes fully realized.","Given current demographics and aging trends, approximately 4 million Americans will turn 65 each year, and a part of these adults will be part of our immunization effort. As we move through the catch-up population and get to a more normalized adult immunization rate domestically, we will be expanding our efforts to capture expected new growth outside the U.S. Given the Asian demographic trends, we expect to obtain several pneumonia recommendations and reimbursements between 2016 and 2018 in many international markets.","IBRANCE continues to be well received by oncologists treating post-menopausal women with ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. There are approximately 3,000 healthcare practitioners already prescribing IBRANCE. This is up from 800 at the end of the first quarter. Our current first-line market share in this patient population was approximately 22% during the quarter, up from 10% during the first quarter.","We look forward to filing for approval in the EU later this year, and are working to add the data from the PALOMA-3 study to our U.S. label for women with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed during and after endocrine therapy. I would note that all of these products I just mentioned are now meaningful contributors to our business.","We also saw quarter-over-quarter operational growth from several of our inline key products, including LYRICA, SUTENT, XALKORI, and INLYTA.","In our Consumer business, we saw quarter-over-quarter operational growth from several brands, including CENTRUM, ADVIL, ROBITUSSIN, and EMERGEN-C. We are seeing strong performance from NEXIUM OTC despite a decline this quarter due to the non-recurrence of initial retailer stocking associated with the launch last May. Since its launch, NEXIUM has generated revenues of approximately $300 million, making it one of the largest and most successful Rx-to-OTC switches.","Regarding other Rx-to-OTC opportunities, we received the top line results from the LIPITOR actual-use trial that was completed last December. Results show that co-primary endpoints were not achieved. Based on our analysis of the data and recent feedback from the FDA on the overall program, we have decided to terminate the program. That said, we continue to evaluate other products for potential Rx-to-OTC switches.","Moving to emerging markets, revenues increased 6% operationally compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by operational growth in PREVNAR, LYRICA, and LIPITOR.","This quarter was a further example of our track record of solid operating performance. Given our strong execution across the businesses during the first half of the year coupled with an improved operational outlook for the remainder of this year, we are raising the midpoints of our 2015 financial guidance for reported revenue by $500 million and for reported diluted EPS by $0.03 per share and adjusted EPS by $0.04.","As we enter the second half of this year, our strategy, focus, and priorities remain unchanged. Top line growth remains a priority. Over the last three quarters we have seen top line operational growth on a total company basis. Recent product launches in key inline products are performing well, while the impact from the remaining LOEs has diminished. For example, the impact from the CELEBREX LOE will be annualized after another two quarters and ZYVOX shortly after that. Once this happens, we will have put the most significant LOEs behind us and expect to return to a more measured cycle of product loss of exclusivity.","We remain steadfast in our efforts to deliver the next wave of potential new innovative therapies over the coming years. The areas where we see the largest potential to benefit patients and where we are focusing our resources include building a strong immuno-oncology portfolio. Per our agreement with Merck KGaA, we believe we have one of the most comprehensive bio platforms in development in the pharma industry today. We expect to have five different IO drugs in the clinic this year and up to 10 different drugs by 2016. The key targets include avelumab, the anti-PD-L1, OX40, 4-1BB, our vaccine-based immuno-therapy regime, CCR2, IDO1, and several bi-functional antibodies. We believe that these combinations are the key to better patient outcomes in IO. And given the breadth of our assets, we think we are well positioned to win here.","We'll be collaborating on up to 20 studies with Merck KGaA, and we plan to have up to six immunology Phase 3 trials ongoing by the end of the year across several tumor types, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian, renal, bladder, and gastric. Our second-line non-small-cell lung cancer registration study is currently recruiting. And where possible, we will be looking to accelerate these studies. For example, we are planning to move quickly into a registration study with avelumab in combination with INLYTA in kidney cancer later this year.","We also continue to build our palbo [palbociclib] franchise, moving our R&D efforts into early stages of the treatment paradigm as well as in non-breast cancer indications.","In cardiovascular, we have a comprehensive Phase 3 trial program for bococizumab, our investigational PCSK9 inhibitor, for its potential to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improve cardiovascular outcomes. We anticipate our LIPITOR low-end trials will complete in 2016, and we estimate that our CV outcomes data will be available in the first half of 2018. The outcomes studies are timed to event trials, so it is difficult to predict exact dates, but we anticipate that this will be consistent with the timing of other industry outcome studies expected by our peers.","Our ertugliflozin Phase 3 program is well underway. And given JANUVIA's recent positive CV outcomes in clinical trial results, we remain enthusiastic about the demand potential for the ertugliflozin-JANUVIA combination in an area of significant patient need.","In vaccines, we recently started a Phase 2b study for our staph-aureus vaccine. And depending on final results, it could serve as a registrational study. Also this month, we initiated a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of our investigational C.difficile vaccine. Both of these vaccines could be key to stemming the spread of the leading causes of serious healthcare associated infections.","In immunology, the FDA accepted review for a supplementary new drug application for XELJANZ once-a-day modified release tablets. Our PDUFA date is February of next year. If approved, it would bring us one step closer to offering the first and only once-a-day oral JAK kinase inhibitor treatment for those living with moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. We believe this will be an important product modification.","In rare diseases, we enrolled the first patients in Phase 3 clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of rivipansel for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in hospitalized individuals with sickle cell disease who are six years of age or older. And additional clinical studies are underway for prevention of sickle cell crisis disease. We believe this will build on our strength in researching and bringing to market therapies for hematological rare diseases based on our deep history in hemophilia.","In biosimilars, we started a Phase 3 clinical trial of our potential biosimilar to bevacizumab, making a total of five monoclonal biosimilars now in Phase 3 development.","In sterile injectables, we're excited about the opportunity to combine Pfizer's branded portfolio and global commercial organization with HOSPIRA's demonstrated R&D capability and manufacturing capacity of sterile injectable products, and this will occur upon the close of the acquisition. Overall, as a result of the work we have done to focus our R&D efforts in the areas we believe offer the greatest potential for therapeutic benefit and chance of commercial success, we are building a stronger portfolio on behalf of our patients that we believe will create value for our shareholders.","Turning now to a few words on business development, it remains an enabler of our strategies and, as I said before, is not a strategy on its own. While we have seen strong performance from our recent product launches, over the next few years we are looking at business development as a way to invest in generating sustained near-term and future growth, knowing that the next wave of our potential major registrations or launches won't happen until 2017. In the interim, we have the financial capacity to actually seek out the right deals at the right price that will create value for our shareholders. We are optimistic that we can find these deals as we go through the period to 2017.","In keeping with this philosophy, we have proactively evaluated virtually all of the deals announced this year and have chosen to pursue only those that efficiently use capital to strengthen the business, drive growth, and accelerate value. For example, we have entered into several agreements year to date that have bolstered our scientific and technical capabilities and provided us with the potential for new growth opportunities. Of particular note are the two most significant transactions with Merck KGaA in immuno-oncology and the pending acquisition of HOSPIRA. Regarding HOSPIRA, we are proceeding on track and are awaiting regulatory approval from several jurisdictions. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of the year.","In closing, I am pleased with our strong financial position, new and inline product performance, pipeline advancements, and recent business development activity. We are performing well. And for the remainder of this year, we will focus on further strengthening both our innovative and established businesses to best position them for their long-term success.","I will now turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details of the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Thanks, Ian, good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast.","In the second quarter of 2015, reported revenues were approximately $11.9 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $125 million or 1%, mainly driven by: the strong performance of PREVNAR 13 adult, ELIQUIS, IBRANCE, and XELJANZ, all of which are early in their life cycles; the addition of vaccines acquired from Baxter in 2014; and operational growth of 6% in emerging markets, mainly due to LIPITOR and PREVNAR 13. Reported revenues were unfavorably impacted by the loss of exclusivity of CELEBREX and ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed European markets.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.56 versus $0.58 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the $0.06 negative impact of foreign exchange and partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 201 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. I want to point out that excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, adjusted diluted EPS would have increased by approximately 6%.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.42 compared with $0.45 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of higher legal charges and acquisition-related costs associated with pending acquisition of HOSPIRA versus the year-ago quarter, as well as charges incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for legal entity alignment activities, partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges associated with cost reduction and productivity initiatives, lower purchase accounting adjustments and a lower effective tax rate versus the year-ago quarter.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter reported revenues by approximately $1 billion or 8% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $518 million or 7%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter.","Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the second quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 8% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including ELIQUIS globally and XELJANZ in the U.S., and the continued strong performance of VIAGRA in the U.S. and LYRICA in the U.S. and Japan, which were partially offset by declines of RAPAMUNE and BenefiX in the U.S.","Income before taxes increased 9% operationally due to the operational increase in revenues and a 2% operational decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses primarily due to additional promotional investment in certain in-line and recently launched products and a 21% operational increase in R&D, reflecting incremental investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab.","Second quarter VOC revenues increased 29% operationally due to the 52% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of PREVNAR 13 which grew 87% in the U.S. due to continued strong uptake in adults and 10% internationally, and the inclusion of Baxter's marketed vaccines in Europe. A 36% operational increase in oncology revenues, driven by the launch of IBRANCE in the U.S. in February, and to a lesser extent by SUTENT, INLYTA, and XALKORI.","Income before taxes increased 51% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues and the associated improvement in gross margin, and a 16% operational decrease in R&D expenses as a result of lower clinical spend for TRUMENBA, PREVNAR 13 Adult and certain oncology products, which were partially offset by a 15% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investment in both the PREVNAR 13 and IBRANCE launches.","In the second quarter, Global Established Products revenues decreased 14% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-sourced generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December of 2014, generic competition for ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed markets in Europe beginning in the first half of 2015 and, to a lesser extent, from continued generic competition for LIPITOR in developed markets and the termination of the SPIRIVA co-promotion agreement in most countries, including the U.S. in April of 2014. All of these were partially offset by operational growth of 2% in emerging markets, primarily driven by LIPITOR.","Income before taxes declined 17% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 1.5 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to unfavorable change in product mix, a 3% operational increase in R&D expenses reflecting increased spending in our biosimilars and sterile injectables development programs, largely offset by lower post-marketing clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by an 11% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity initiatives.","Because of our strong operational performance and improved operational outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues by $500 million and the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.04. We now expect reported revenues to be in the range of $45 billion to $46 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07. We also now expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.47.","In addition, based on our year-to-date results we now expect cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% versus our previous expectation of 18.5% to 19.5%. To reflect incremental expenses for ongoing Phase 3 programs, we now expect our R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion versus $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion previously. It's important to note that any changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-April which exclude the impact of potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar did not materially impact our latest guidance.","I also want to point out that we are continuing to absorb an estimated $3.4 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity and declining alliance revenues, and an estimated $3.3 billion negative impact of unfavorable changes in essentially all foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates in 2014.","Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of solid financial performance, primarily driven by products that are in the early stages of their life cycles: PREVNAR 13 Adult, ELIQUIS, IBRANCE, and XELJANZ. Also I want to point out that this is the third consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. We raised the midpoints of our 2015 reported revenue and EPS guidance ranges to reflect our strong operational performance and improved operational outlook for the remainder of 2015.","We achieved several key R&D milestones since our first quarter update, including FDA acceptance of our NDA for XELJANZ once-daily, the anticipated PDUFA date of February of 2016 and the presentation of data from our immuno-oncology portfolio at ASCO, which included 10 abstracts on avelumab with our partner Merck KGaA, as well as results from a Phase 1 study of our anti-4-1BB antibody.","We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To-date in 2015, we've returned $9.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank and Ian, for the summary. With that, operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. First on the immuno-oncology franchise. While you're somewhat behind, Ian, can you comment on some of the aspects of your strategy in IO that might not be fully appreciated by the investment community?","And my second question, perhaps for either of you on the subject of what you call business and legal entity alignment activities. Those costs are growing strongly. Can you offer any color as to when those activities might wrap up, or at least what some key mile markers are along the way on that process? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. We believe that we will be first in some tumor types with the PD-L1 from Merck, but we also feel it's very important to understand that we're just at the beginning of this immuno-oncology wave. And we have, as I commented previously, a substantial number of assets that can be combined and added, both with immuno-oncology assets and with the backbone targeted therapies or chemotherapy or with INLYTA or with XALKORI, with IBRANCE potentially.","So we feel that, as this market develops, what's going to be really important is the ability to have combination products and the ability to have a more full control of the total value of the total pricing of those combination products to the payers. So we believe that Pfizer will be very well positioned with multiple combinations of immuno-oncology assets and combinations of its own inline assets to be very, very effective in those combinations. Frank, do you want to talk about the...","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sure. So on the business and legal entity alignment, let me run the numbers first and then I'll answer the question, which is for the quarter we spent $63 million, year to date $164 million in business and legal entity alignment cost. I said previously we forecasted a spend of approximately $400 million for the year. We'll be give or take in that range of approximately $400 million. The spend will continue obviously for the rest of 2015 through 2016. We've talked about a decision on alignment in the fourth quarter of 2016, by no later than the fourth quarter of 2016, suspending obviously we've continue through then, at which point we make a determination going forward based on the decision that we make.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","First question is can you give us your latest thoughts on what's going on in China as well as just the broader emerging markets?","Second, in the press release it talked about for PREVNAR the Gavi shipments and emerging markets had some special programs. Can you just give us a sense of how much of that was one-timers versus what we should expect ongoing?","And then I think you mentioned how much FX hit your expenses. But can you carve out the gross margin specifically and how much that had an impact? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, look. We remain, as we've said, optimistic about the long term in China and the emerging markets. We continue to see a secular movement to the middle class and wealth creation. I would ask John Young, who manages the majority of our business in the emerging markets, to make some comments specifically on China, and perhaps his view of the opportunities more broadly in emerging markets.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay, thanks for the question, Marc. So I think Ian hit on our view in summary form. It's obviously a significant population, 1.3 billion people. We continue to see strong economic growth, albeit moderating economic growth, but we envision that the economic growth will continue. And I think as Ian has already flagged, we see a continued commitment from the Chinese government to expand access to healthcare, to quality healthcare to its citizens. We don't see that trend halting in the short to medium, even the longer term. And so we believe that actually for manufacturers such as ourselves who are positioned well in China with a strong existing base, a strong network of joint ventures, and a portfolio frankly that is well suited to the needs of Chinese patients, ranging from our innovative portfolio with oncology medicines and vaccines in the future as well as today's portfolio such as LIPITOR, which is obviously a leading treatment to help to manage cardiovascular disease, which is a growing concern for Chinese patients.","So when you sum all of that up, we know that we will continue to see some pressures on our business in China and pricing. We've factored that into our forward-looking views, and we will continue to see China being a significant opportunity for future growth.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. And similar stories played out in most of the emerging markets, too, and in differing forms. Albert, do you want to talk about the Gavi shipments and those items that were raised?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, I wouldn't call them one-time. What is happening with the Gavi businesses is there is volatility. Volatility depends on when the CDC places an order or when Gavi will place an order or where or when an IP will occur. So this volatility will continue. This is the normal course of the vaccines business. But in general, pediatric is doing very well this quarter with 5% overall growth.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Frank, on the FX?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Sure. So, Marc, lots of moving parts, obviously, that impact gross margin. Favorable items would be things like our oncology and alliance revenue growth. An unfavorable item would be our U.S. LOEs. But maybe the easiest way to do this macro level with the numbers, Q2 last year our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 18.9%, this quarter 17.9%. If we remove foreign exchange from this quarter, which reduced cost of sales by $255 million, that 17.9% becomes 18.4%, so roughly flat year over year. If you go year to date, last year, year to date 17.9%; this year, year to date 17.3%. If we remove foreign exchange, that's 17.3% becomes 18.2%, once again, relatively flat year over year with a lot of moving parts impacting the number.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. If I could go back to the topic of M&A, and, Ian, I know you made some comments earlier. Watching the big pharma industry for almost 20 years, it seems like big pharma companies have very often not participated in biotech M&A because there has been this longstanding sense that the valuations are too high. And if I listen to what several companies say now at the current point in time, several big pharma companies again \u2013 and I raise that concern if I look at what Pfizer has bought over years, it's generally been either big pharma companies or other types of targets like Hospira. So my question to you is how do you currently view valuations in the biotech space? And have you loosened up at all in your valuation framework such that you think you can find value in the biotech landscape at the current levels of valuation?","And then second question is on ENBREL and whether you expect to see any pressure caused by biosimilar REMICADE now being available in Europe, or do you expect pressure in year 2016 or 2017 or maybe even in the current year?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. I'll make some comments on M&A, and then I'll ask Geno to comment on ENBREL in Europe. Tim, I believe that the marketplace is extremely efficient and that the valuations in biotech are in many ways price perfection. But all the deals that have been done, we have looked at them. The deals work for some companies because of their portfolio, because of their ability to achieve synergies in ways that perhaps we couldn't.","We do remain disciplined on our cost of capital. We think long term that's important, that people who invest in Pfizer expect a risk-adjusted return on the cost of capital. That means that we don't expect to find value in the marketplace. There are always opportunities. We stand ready. We have the cash. We have the capability. We have the management team. We are continually looking for those opportunities. As I say, I'm optimistic that we'll be able to deploy our capital in a way that will increment value to shareholders.","I would say further that if you look at the Established Products business and the Innovative business, if there were two projects and both of them were risk-adjusted equal, our inclination would be to do, for portfolio reasons, something in the Innovative space rather than the Established space, given that we've done the Hospira acquisition for Established.","So once again, I'm very well aware that there is an active market for business development. We think we've done the ones that are prudent. We evaluate all opportunities, and we're optimistic that we're going to find and have sufficient courage to find those opportunities that come into the marketplace. So with that, I'll pass it over to Geno to look at ENBREL.","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","Sure, Tim. ENBREL continues to do well. We had good 2% operational growth this quarter outside the United States on a very large base, so the business continues to deliver for us.","With regard to REMICADE biosimilars, we're not seeing a significant impact on the ENBREL business. Given the different administration routes, REMICADE being an infusion and ENBREL and HUMIRA and others being self-injected therapies, we don't see a lot of overlap there. There's a lot of experimentation going on country by country, so there's always the possibility that we'll see some new things happening. But overall, we're not seeing or expecting a major shift in the ENBREL business related to the REMICADE biosimilar.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Geno. Operator, can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ian, in your prepared remarks, you signaled M&A activity focused on top line growth bridging the gap to 2017 filings, so I have two questions related to that. Are you backing off from breaking up the company, a strategy you outlined or certainly outlined the optionality for a couple years ago? Where are you on that?","And number two, how big would you consider going? Can you throw out some parameters there in terms of size? Is it all about top line growth? Is synergies a big consideration? And just also you had talked before about tax inversions being an important part of that equation too. So if you can, put that in perspective.","And then my last question relates to Lipitor OTC. Now that that product doesn't appear to be going forward, would you consider putting your Consumer business up for sale? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, Jami, as always, pretty big questions. Okay, on the breakup, we have not changed our views on wanting to have the optionality of the breakup. We continue to spend considerable amounts of money preparing and putting ourselves in a place to trigger that optionality if we take that decision. And as I said, we've laid out the criteria for that, which includes are the businesses doing well, do we think they could do well on their own, is there trapped value, and is there after-tax value that could be achieved? And we will make that decision by the latest the fourth quarter of 2016 on whether to trigger that optionality.","On your question about big, small growth opportunities, we look at it from the point of view of, as a pharmaceutical company, we want to buy \u2013 the ideal of course is to buy a pipeline and also products that are growing. These products and opportunities, you have to have a belief in the future \u2013 often the future potential of the products you're buying. There's a lot involved in an acquisition this large. It's a combination of what you think the portfolio will do, what you believe the synergies that will come through on the operational side, and of course tax and tax planning plays a role in that. So to a certain extent, the discussions that are going on in Washington right now about potential international tax reform does affect the way we look at the different opportunities we have in the marketplace. You would expect us to be looking at that very carefully. Certainly, any acquisition we do make will have a bias on the near-term revenue opportunities and on accretion.","OTC, look, the Consumer business is a tremendous business, a tremendous store of value. We took NEXIUM OTC and it has been an incredible success. We continue to invest in the Consumer business. We always look at our businesses, all of them, on a regular basis and our strategic plan vis-\u00e0-vis what part they play in the total value to Pfizer shareholders. We're always reviewing that. At this moment, I think the Consumer business is a very valuable and growing asset for Pfizer. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian, our next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thank you for a very clear opening statement from all of you. It's always very helpful. I want to go back and build on some of the questions that have already been asked. But the first one is just, Ian, I know you get asked this every quarter, and I'm sure Chuck tells you you're going to asked this every quarter, but this quarter I think it's become a little bit more of a focus for investors. There are widespread Wall Street rumors that you might be interested in something like an Allergan. I understand you wouldn't comment on that. But can you just comment in general on your interest in inverting at this point? What kind of thresholds would need to be versus what the official thresholds right now to make you comfortable that such an inversion could be completed? Is inversion still a priority I guess for Pfizer?","The second question was for Frank. Maybe you've disclosed this. I'm not sure, so shame on me if you have. But I've heard from little birdies that money that you've already spent preparing for separation, this might have been embedded into an earlier answer, it wasn't clear to me. But the money that you've already spent preparing for a separation of Pfizer is on the order of $1 billion. I'd just like to know if that number is \u2013 if you're willing publicly to talk about whether or not that number is realistic.","And then the final question, and this is a tougher one. I don't know if you'll be able to answer it. But some of us have been now thinking about if and when Pfizer splits, perhaps instead of floating one or more of these companies, they might be a strategic acquirer for one or more of these companies. I think we're all trying to get a sense of what the cost basis is for these companies so that we could understand if it's realistic that someone could buy them, or would the tax burden on such a transaction be prohibitive? I don't know if there's any kind of even finger in the wind, words of wisdom you can give us, Frank. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So, Mark, on the inversion question, the reason you do any deal is, as we said before, and it sounds like mother putting up a pie, but it's that we believe it's going to create value for shareholders long term. And so we can remain interested in the potential of an inversion because it would facilitate and enable wealth creation for shareholders. It would certainly also position Pfizer on the current tax laws to be \u2013 it would liberate our balance sheet and would position us to be far more active in the M&A space and competitive, which is why there's always a push to have tax reform because at the moment the American companies are not as competitive as the European companies given the different tax rate.","So the inversion is attractive both because it creates immediate value and enables you to meet the premiums to acquire the company. And it's attractive because it will liberate your balance sheet for future activity and spending and cash flow. And that, in its turn, informs you as to what level of inversion you find acceptable, whether you want an inversion that is between 60% and 80% or below 60%. So it's a complex issue. And we're not focused totally on inversions. It's only a component of the business development strategy and only comes in when you believe you need that value that's created by the inversion to get to the premium to buy the company. But inversion is not our one-track business development strategy. With that, I will pass it over to Frank, who will answer the other two difficult questions.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","The little birdie question.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","The little birdie question.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","So, Mark, year to date, cumulatively to date, because that's what you're asking, not year to date, cumulatively to date we've spent give or take approximately $300 million. And I include the $164 million year to date this year. The thing to remember about these kinds of optionality projects, think about carve-outs, as I said. There's a massive amount of work that needs to be done. And when you're looking at I'll call it the total cost structure, these kinds of projects, they do run into the low billions of dollars. That's the nature of what they do.","But here's what you've got to remember. In that number, there's tax leakage. Now you do everything you can to minimize tax leakage, but you've got to create multiple legal entities. Anytime you're creating multiple legal entities or more than one in a country, you create tax exposure, tax leakage. There's potential leakage regarding debt and the decision making you make around whether or not you're going to repurchase debt.","And then there's all that I call blocking and tackling that needs to be done in areas like systems, legal entity and tax planning, regulatory work, supply chain. It's a massive amount of work. And think about the visual. This is a company that's been restructuring for a decade, integrating, putting things together. And now you want to do something where you're taking a major piece of the company and you're going to carve it out, in a sense undo much of the work that you've done previously. It requires a lot of effort. It costs a bunch of money. But year-to-date, which is what you asked me, cumulatively to-date, it's been about $300 million.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","That being said, we do see the logic because there are two different businesses and we do feel that the amounts we will need to spend to put ourselves in a position to complete optionality as being money well spent for shareholders given the potential upside of what optionality could produce.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Essentially, the cost of having the option is really what it translates to, Mark. It's really the cost of having the option.","And then the last piece about tax basis, obviously it's premature to get into tax basis of the businesses. But what I would say is to just punctuate what Ian said, the fourth criteria is being able to unlock that trapped value assuming there is some, in a tax efficient way. So obviously, anything we would do with that extensive tax planning would maximize the after-tax return to our shareholders.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian and Frank. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citigroup.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Three questions, please. Firstly, just revisiting the tax question. Could you give us some sense over the next three years to five years where your effective tax rate is going as the business currently stands given the change in mix of the business, particularly the increasing U.S. contribution?","And second on the tax, how do you feel the ongoing debate in Washington, what the probability you feel of any meaningful change may improve the effective tax rate that you pay?","Second, could you comment how the recent Teva-Allergan deal impacts the M&A landscape from a Pfizer perspective?","And then finally, you obviously reported a very strong quarter for PREVNAR 13. To what extent should we expect an inventory destock in the following quarter, i.e., how much of this is industry stocking, given I imagine that most of the vaccinations are going to happen (44:10)? But please correct me if I'm wrong.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew. On the tax question, we don't project our tax rate. There are just too many variables in there, including business development, including where we make our earnings, including potential changes in U.S. tax law, and we give guidance on a yearly basis on our tax rate. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Just that year-to-date, our tax rate is 25%. Our guidance for the year is 25%. So for 2015, we're running pretty much right according to our guidance. And then just to punctuate what Ian said, there's just too many moving parts to try to project out tax rates beyond the current year. But we'll obviously include the 2016 rate when we provide our 2016 guidance.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. On DC, look, it's too difficult to speculate on what would happen on tax legislation. I do think I am heartened by the conversations that are occurring and the acknowledgment in Washington that something has to be done to allow global U.S. corporations to become competitive, given the nature of the U.S. tax system. And hopefully they will take action earlier rather than later to allow us to be competitive. And I think we will see that unfold in the next five months as to whether Washington will take any action on that or not.","On the Teva-Allergan, does it change the landscape for us? I don't think it changes the landscape for Pfizer in any material way. We continue to have our own strategies and pursue our own BD objectives and this doesn't impinge upon that. Frank, do you want to talk about anything else? Oh, yeah, and then it's Albert on the PREVNAR 13.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, Andrew. I'm monitoring the inventories and there was no significant inventory build in the quarter. So inventories didn't materially affect the Adult performance also.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So I think, Andrew, what we need to do on PREVNAR 13 Adult is, you have three influences or four influences going on. One, you have the underlying rate of U.S. citizens becoming 65, which is about 4 million a year. You have then in the U.S. the bolus of catch-up, which is significant and we believe will last certainly this year and next and maybe into the third year. And then you have the progress in the G6 countries as we get and have had per our registration and labeling changes to enable adult vaccine to be sold to the 65 and above.","And there, of course, you have a huge cohort of probably substantially larger than the U.S., probably twice the size of the U.S. And that's going to take market development. We're going to have to work on that country by country. But we see there also the movement of the population to over 65 plus the catch-up opportunity. So overall when you look at those waves of opportunities, we feel that the adult vaccine is an interesting ongoing large franchise for Pfizer.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of quick ones. On your AVASTIN biosimilar, you started the Phase 3 trial with a primary endpoint of objective response rate. Can you talk about the discussions you've had with regulators and whether you anticipate objective response will be an approvable endpoint?","And then just two, on the IO pipeline, can you walk us through the key readouts we should be paying attention to over the next 12 months? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. Technical question there, Colin, on that. I don't know if, Mikael, you want to address that question?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","All of our Pfizer biosimilars have been evolved in their development strategies in close consultations with the major regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA. So they all reflect input and robustness in trial design and what should be predicted the best choice of endpoint for approval opportunity.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So I think we feel satisfied that we have an agreement with the major agencies and the endpoints will be the ones necessary to get approval.","IO pipeline. Mikael, do you want to run through that or tell them what you think are the significant things coming forward and when we're likely to be issuing results?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So I am really excited about our IO pipeline. And starting with anchor drug, avelumab, we have now more than 1,000 patients that have been on avelumab. And we feel that we see a consistent good response rate, substantial clinical durability in responses and a robust safety profile. And we reported some studies at ASCO and now we have positive readouts in lung, gastric, ovarian and bladder.","You're aware and Ian alluded to that we've started a second-line lung cancer trial. We expect in the relatively near term opportunity to move to first-line in that setting. Our experience across the various indications will lead this year to numerous announcements of Phase 3, up to six pivotal studies that include several in lung, gastric, ovarian, bladder and renal.","We also at ASCO communicated favorable data on 4-1BB already seen in the Phase 1 in follicle lymphoma showing good tolerability and together with rituximab favorable responses. We are expanding that study. 4-1BB, which is a unique molecule, one of the few I think in this industry this advanced, is also in studies with katuda (50:41) as well as soon to be in an extensive program with avelumab.","We also have recently entered clinical studies with OX40 as another positive event for our immuno-oncology pipeline. And we have communicated favorable data with our CCR2 in pancreatic cancer. And later this year we expect a vaccine to start dosing for prostate cancer, and we have numerous compounds, NMEs, that will also enter next year. So you see really us evolving a very comprehensive monotherapy and a combination therapy. We will over time share more data. There is an ESMO conference that we'll give you an update on avelumab and will include particular lung cancer, ovarian, and also some bladder we expect, and we'll continue to inform you about the progress of 4-1BB.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks so much for taking my questions, so two if I could, one building a little bit on what you talked about earlier around the amount of cost around planning for a potential split. Do you have a sense of what the dyssynergies would be to actually execute a split of the company at this point if you're trying to split it into two parts? I just think you may have some sense of that by now. And as more of us view Pfizer as a sum of the parts basis, it would be helpful to have a sense of how you think the dyssynergies would be.","And then the second question I had was just on the vaccine side with the VOC business, a lot of focus on oncology obviously. But can you talk a little more generally about your strategy in vaccines? You're obviously making good progress with PREVNAR in adults. Staph is moving along and that obviously looks promising, but maybe a little more broadly where you see other potential areas for value there. You've obviously made some deals. You have maternal vaccines. You talk about C.diff. What do you think people might be underappreciating with your vaccines business as opposed to how you see it internally right now? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, on the cost of dyssynergies, Frank, do you want to make a comment on that?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","From my perspective, we've obviously been looking at this. We've been analyzing it in detail. I think I'd summarize it by saying we don't see it as being a material dyssynergy relative to optionality based on all our current analysis.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So your question the vaccines, I'll try and do a summarized answer, and then I'll ask Albert if he wants to add anything to it. I think you're seeing us continue to drive and maximize the PREVNAR 13 opportunity both in infants and adults. We believe that the opportunity in adults is broad and deep and durable, so we're confident in that. We continue to work on PREVNAR, on the PREVNAR family to look at further enhancements.","We believe there's a real opportunity to accelerate as long as the Phase 2 trial on the back surgery performs as we expect, we think there's an opportunity to accelerate the staph-aureus vaccine. We're in Phase 2 with what we believe is a very good vaccine with C.difficile. And then we've made acquisitions of other vaccines like the Baxter (54:08) acquisition to add some critical mass to what our field force carries. We have TRUMENBA, which we think will develop over time as an important vaccine. And then we've done acquisitions and licensing of vaccines for infants. So do you want to add some more detail to that, Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Very few things to add, Ian. I think in vaccines we have substantial scientific capabilities and significant substrate, research substrate, that allows us to see optimistically into the future, and we've had a very good track record of delivery. With staph, we have already initiated, as Ian said, the Phase 2b study, and that's in 2,600 patients. If the Phase 2b data show considerable efficacy, we will consider requesting an accelerated approval from this product, and the study that we are running now could potentially serve to support registration.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","And have breakthrough status, right?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And have breakthrough status. And the same as it was for C.difficile. That has breakthrough status, but also as you recall we had outed recruitment and vaccinations in a previously initiated Phase 2b study as a result of some cases of redness that we observed at the injection site. Now we have already recently received approval from the FDA to initiate a new Phase 2 program with a different formulation. So we are moving full speed in materializing that as well.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the questions. The first one was just a little bit more color on PREVNAR 13 adult. I appreciate the earlier comments, but can you just give us little more color? When you think about the U.S. catch-up bolus, how large is that bolus and how far through are you at this point? Do you have any numbers on that front? It would be pretty helpful.","Second on your PD-L1, you highlighted in the past the high disease control rate that we've seen with some of the studies. I guess when can we see more survival data that could help us assess that disease control rate versus maybe some higher overall response rates we're seeing from other products as we just think about this as a combinable agent longer term?","And the final one was just coming back to business development. It does seems like we're just seeing a significant consolidation in the industry at the same time we're seeing an uptick in innovation. I know Pfizer has priorities in terms of what it needs to do given its product cycle. But could you just elaborate a little bit more just how this rapidly changing environment is impacting your business development priorities, either in terms of further sense of urgency, willingness to broaden the scope of what you're looking at? I'm just trying to understand how the backdrop of the sector affects how you're pursuing deals. Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. PREVNAR 13, Albert, why don't you give us \u2013 yeah.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Again, I will express my excitement about the success that they're having so far with PREVNAR in the U.S. And basically, we're able to make pneumonia vaccination for adults an age-based event, so people would get vaccinated when they come to age of 65 rather than a seasonal event. But of course, we were very successful in catching up a lot of previously vaccinated.","To give you a sense of the numbers in the U.S., as Ian said, approximately 4 million people are turning 65 every year. In 2014, when we started with PREVNAR, there was a large cohort of approximately 27 million people that that were previously vaccinated with an old technology vaccine. And there was also another cohort of 18 million people that had never received a vaccine; so in total 45 million people. Usually there are 2.6 million deaths also that are happening per year in that cohort. So main, we don't have exact split of how much is catch-up and how much is normal business in the U.S. But given the massive number of vaccinations that are occurring, a big part is coming from catch-up, and this is large, as we said. That's why we said that this year we'll continue growing and will be very big. Next year also will be substantial, very big, might not grow versus 2015, but will be very big.","And then we move internationally. Internationally, the age and demographics are more compelling than the U.S. because the percentage of people that are living above 65 is much higher. Countries like Japan, for example, is almost double than in the U.S. in terms of percentage, 14% approximately in the U.S. to 26%, 27%, 28% in Japan. And this is where we expect in the G7 to start getting a wave of recommendations now that we've got approval in Europe for pneumonia. But as long as we get recommendation, then reinvestment comes and then we start commercially penetrating very aggressively, as we did in the U.S.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Albert. I believe the cohort in the G6 countries are around 94 million.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","That's correct. It's double the U.S.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Double the U.S., okay. PD-L1 data, yeah, that we are in partnership with Merck KGaA...","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So at a more higher level we can say when we carefully go through data from lung, ovarian, gastric, and bladder, where we have extensive number of patients for six months or more, we see response rates that are very comparable to other PD-1, PD-L1 agents. Of course, it depends on how you cut your data. We have generally looked at response rate including all patients and not solely PD-L1-positive, and that's part of our long-term strategy that it seems that patients that even have low expression of PD-L1 will benefit, particularly when you later develop combination therapies. So we accumulate experiences across all PD-L1 spectrum, but will of course in various endpoints look at PD-L1-positive. That was the strategy in our second-line lung cancer, which is all-inclusive for lung cancer patients in second-line, but the primary endpoint is on PD-L1-positive.","Disease control rates are very high in our studies, in general, 50% or higher across several indications. And when we again compare to others, where do we look at disease control rate, six months progression-free survival, et cetera, we are very pleased with avelumab both for efficacy and tolerability, and you will get further data update at the ESMO oncology conference.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Going back to BD, look, we look at BD probably in two large ways in Pfizer. One is when we're looking at individual needs of the business units, which can be like a smaller tuck-in or can be an acquisition of an individual product. When we look at individual products, it tends to have normally \u2013 because very often you're buying the product at the beginning of it, either before it's approved or after it's approved, but you're looking at opportunities to expand indications. And so we look at the risk-adjusted return and we make a decision whether to participate in that franchise. And that can be influenced by the ability to combine it with our existing therapeutic areas if we can get also additional synergies through operational savings. So that's one way we're looking at BD which is more opportunistic, product related.","Second type of BD is trying to buy technology, like perhaps gene therapy or selectors when we're going to CAR-T technology. Those tend to be longer-term investments. And the third type of BD is what you would say is a more traditional BD, where we look at total companies. And there the driver of value often is existing pipeline, existing products, potential pipeline product opportunities, synergies, and potentially tax savings and future liberation of the balance sheet because you are no longer are constrained by the U.S. tax situation.","So I think what you've been seeing in the marketplace is foreign companies with significant tax advantages taking advantage of acquisitions in the U.S. and building up their organization. You've seen a refocusing by some companies, and you've seen with the Allergan-Teva transaction where one company needs to strengthen its portfolio and focus by acquiring the generic of the other company. So look, we are actively monitoring this process. I don't think we've lost out to any opportunities that would have made sense for our shareholders. We're determined if an opportunity is there we will not lose out. We have the world. We have the capability. We have the capital. We have the management team. So I feel that, frankly, our BD strategy and philosophy and approach is appropriate for this point of time in the value cycles.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks, gents, and congratulations on a strong quarter. First on biosimilars, you have five antibodies in development. You're obviously making a significant investment there. Can you update us on your updated views on the potential of Pfizer in the biosimilar market in light of what we're seeing in Europe and how we should think about the opportunity for Pfizer?","To follow up on that, given these investments, how should we think about some of the overlapping assets that you're getting from Hospira? And then finally, could you comment on the recent PCSK9 approval and potential implications for your bococizumab? Thank you very much.","John Young - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks for the question, Alex. So first of all in terms of your question about the size of the market, we continue see around about $100 billion of currently patented biologic medicines that will lose patent protection over the next five to ten years. That's a significant market opportunity for companies that have the technology platform capability and current biosimilar portfolio to be able to capitalize on that opportunity. So we continue to think that we are very well placed.","And in relation to your question about Hospira, we continue to see that our portfolio and Hospira's are highly complementary and we're very excited about the opportunity that that presents post-close.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","On the PCSK9 approval by in Europe from Amgen in the U.S., by Sanofi Regeneron, I think we expected on LDL lowering. I don't see substantial \u2013 I see modest use of these products until the outcomes data comes through. We don't think we would be that far behind on outcomes data. I think the size of the market is difficult to predict at this time. It really depends on how the CETP development comes through. If the CETPs which are oral come through, I could see a market that is segmented three ways; i.e., statin use that sees you get to goals, statin plus a CETP, or a CETP alone if you're statin intolerant; and then potentially PCSK9 being held in reserve if the CETP can't get you to the goals of the statin.","So it's very, very difficult to predict how this market will shake out in value. And I think it's interesting to see what will happen in 2016 if the CETPs are approved and what type of label, what type of pricing they come into the market with and what type of pricing we see develop on the PCSK9s as negotiations occur with managed care.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. Just back to PREVNAR 13, can you quantify the shipments that you made into Gavi and the vaccine alliance and also provide some additional color on which national immunization programs included PREVNAR 13 into their program?","And then secondly, on your XELJANZ filing in the EU, can you remind us what led to the rejection and what remedies that you've made to the filing? I believe you mentioned you're on track to file before the end of the year in the EU. That would help enhance the ability to secure approval on XELJANZ in Europe. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Geno can deal with the XELJANZ question and then I'll see if Albert has any data at hand that's pretty specific on your question, John, or we'll just have to answer in generalities right now. But let's get to Geno first.","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. I think the questions from the CHMP revolved a lot around the immune system effects of XELJANZ, understanding the safety profile primarily. So we have done some additional pharmacology studies, we've done a study with the herpes zoster vaccine to demonstrate a lack of interference with the immunogenicity of the vaccine and of course collected longer-term follow-up data from our long-term extension trials and our post-marketing surveillance trial. So it will be a combination of these data points that will comprise the resubmission that we're planning on for later this year.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","John, I don't have handy the numbers, so I will have to come back to you. But in general in emerging markets, the growth was 18% for pediatric approximately for the quarter. And this volatility will continue to exist.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Yeah, because it depends on the timing of NIP, the timing of Gavi.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Correct.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","And it's not something that we are particularly focused on. We have a full-year forecast which takes into account all these fluctuations and we've built that into the change in our guidance.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","That's all part of our revenue guidance.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, right. Okay.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Okay, thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So the first one is just around business development. If you can follow on here, so do you have a bias towards OUS-domiciled companies when you're looking at opportunities to help grow the GIP business, given where your cash is held?","Second, because of your focus on doing BD in the next two years to bridge to 2017, does that mean we should expect much less cash to be diverted towards share repurchases? And then lastly just on the BD, given your want or desire to help boost the business prior to 2017, doesn't that mean given time for antitrust review or any other reviews of a transaction that we should be expecting you to announce additional deals during the second half of this year for them to come into that timeframe?","And then last question just on a separate area. Can you maybe outline for us just a couple of the biggest OTC switch opportunities that you see for the business potentially in the next two years to three years? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, on the OTC switch, I don't want to get into that because it's confidential and helps competitors prepare along with us in the marketplace. So I think you can look at our portfolio and make assumptions on your own as to which products are more likely to be switched or not.","On the BD, I have no bias towards a U.S. or a foreign company. I have a bias to value creation. I have a bias on our portfolio, if valuations are equal and opportunities are equal, I'd prefer to do a BD deal that strengthens our Innovative business as I think we've done quite a bit to strengthen the Established business.","On less cash depending on an acquisition, I think it depends on the type of acquisition and how it's structured and I think it's too early to say. But of course any deal we do we'll be looking at total shareholder returns and we would factor that in to the type of deal we're structuring. I think that's the most you would say at this time, frankly, about that.","And then on timing, when I talk about 2017, I'm talking about \u2013 frankly, I use that as a marker given conversations I had with our owners about the fact that you've got great inline momentum, you've got these new products, you've got ELIQUIS and you've got IBRANCE an adult vaccine and all the other inlines that are moving well. I'm just looking at ways of increasing our revenues as we develop our pipeline and we start to see that pipeline come to fruition in 2017 and launch in 2018, and we'll see those launches 2017 through 2018 through 2019.","So I think it's important to get any BD we do right and I don't feel pressurized to get it right by 2017. What's important is to get it right to create value for our shareholders. And I don't think, frankly, there's a timing pressure on us to do BD. We're going to look at it. We want to do BD. We're going to be opportunistic, but we're also going to make sure that we make the right decisions for Pfizer shareholders.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thank you, Ian. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just remind us about the ex-U.S. ENBREL exclusivity loss timing and expectations for timing of biosimilar competitor launches?","And then with respect to IBRANCE, could you please discuss potential indications outside of breast cancer and what key trials we should be watching on that front? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay, thank you. Geno, could you do the ENBREL?","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","ENBREL exclusivity expires at the end of this year and so we expect to see biosimilar penetration beginning next year in Europe.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. IBRANCE indications outside of breast cancer?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","We are very excited about the potential of IBRANCE. And I think we have real unique proprietary knowledge in understanding how to use science around IBRANCE combination new indications. So we have an extensive collaborative research clinical programs that you may be aware of. But in addition to that, I'm pleased to say that we are starting a number of Pfizer-sponsored new studies. And very soon we'll start one study in head and neck cancer HPV-negative patients that are recurrent metastatic, combining IBRANCE with ERBITUX. We have prior experience of that combination in a collaborative study and are launching a Pfizer-sponsored which could have a very interesting path forward if data is strong.","In addition to that, we have generated very compelling pre-clinical data on human tumors for pancreatic cancer, where particularly the combination of IBRANCE with nab-paclitaxel or ABRAXANE was very promising. And we are soon starting a Phase 2 study preceded by a safety lead-in with IBRANCE and ABRAXANE in pancreatic advanced cancer. We also have significant effort in understanding patients that progress on IBRANCE after having had long significant benefit in breast cancer. And you will learn more about Pfizer's program in double and triple combination that also can further expand our stronghold and leadership in IBRANCE.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. If we could take our last question, please, operator?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Frank, maybe could you remind us the threshold for completing an inversion? And I ask the question particularly since some smaller deals appear to have gotten as low as 20% after the treasury update. So it would just be helpful to know what your thoughts are on the threshold for inversion because I think previously you had said it was really 40%.","And then separately, as part of your optionality calculus with the split, do you also consider Pfizer as a potential target in that calculus since this would appear to be a value-add option for shareholders? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Are you saying Pfizer or the split of Pfizer? Seamus can't reply. Okay, look, it's probably the split. We think that in the optionality, both companies will be robust and strong and would have the ability to be successful companies on their own. And we really cannot comment on whether it would be BD activity to try and buy those companies. They would be companies that would be independent and continue to try and progress their own business strategies. On the inversion?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Prior to the \u2013 I'll call it the September 22 proposed rule changes by the IRS, the hurdle was less than 80%. So our shareholders had to own less than 80% of the newly formed company that we acquired to get the full benefits of an inversion. That hurdle was lowered to less than 60%, which means we'd have to do a larger acquisition to get the full benefits. So it went from less than 80% to less than 60%.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","The issue with this, Seamus, is that the full benefit or non-full benefit is very idiosyncratic depending upon the company you're doing the inversion on and the complexity of the tax rules. So it may be that if you're in below 80% but not below 60%, you still have substantial benefits from an inversion. And therefore, despite the proposal changes or maybe on different targets, you need to be below the 60% threshold. So the universe is not constricted or reduced to only 60:40. It's very dependent upon the type of assets, debt structure, where the cash is, et cetera, et cetera.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Very company specific.","Ian C.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2019 performance and updated 2019 financial guidance. I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at pfizer.com\/investors. You\u2019ll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question-and-answer session","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss our quarterly business performance, latest updates from our pipeline and our plans for Pfizer following the anticipated completion of the Upjohn-Mylan combination, which we continue to expect to care in meet 2020.","During the quarter, we delivered a strong performance highlighted by 9% operational revenue growth in our Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, which will be the business that remains at Pfizer following the anticipate closing of the Upjohn transaction. We also saw revenue impacted by two expected events, the July loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for Lyrica and the July 31 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK.","For biopharmaceuticals, once again, these groups outstanding growth was driven primarily by strong performance from our key growth drivers. This include Ibrance, Xtandi, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Vyndaqel end Inlyta, as well as 15% operational growth in emerging markets including 42% operational growth in China. Our biopharmaceutical business in China generated higher revenues this quarter than the Upjohn business in the country.","Our oncology business was particularly strong up 30% operationally compared with a year ago quarter. Global revenues for Ibrance were up 27% operationally in the quarter to $1.3 billion. We saw strong revenue growth in both U.S. and international markets. We believe the continued growth in the U.S. is the result of our efforts to target specific physicians who had not been prescribing CDK inhibitors or had prescribed them to only a small set of patients.","For Xtandi, the alliance revenues in the U.S. grew 25% to $225 million. In August, the FDA granted Xtandi priority review designation for the treatment of men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer with a PDUFA date in December. If approved, this represents get another potential growth driver for the brand.","Inlyta revenues increased 98% operationally to $139 million. This included 240% growth in the U.S. or Inlyta has benefited from recent FDA approvals for the combination of Inlyta plus BAVENCIO and Inlyta plus KEYTRUDA in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma patients.","Beyond Oncology, we had several other strong product performances. Global revenues for Xeljanz were up 40% operationally to $599 million. We saw continued volume growth in the rheumatoid arthritis indication. And the recent launches for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. and for ulcerative colitis in both the U.S. and certain other developed markets also significantly contributed to the growth.","Eliquis also continued to perform well. Global revenues were up 20% operationally to $1 billion. This growth was driven primarily by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, as well as oral anti-coagulant market share gains.","Looking at our rare diseases business, Vyndaqel continues to ramp up nicely in the U.S. following the May 2019 approval and launch. Our early disease awareness efforts have helped drive the diagnosis rates to greater than 4% in the quarter compared with 1% prior to launch.","As of end of August, approximately 4,100 patients had been diagnosed, approximately 2,600 patients could receive the prescription for Vyndaqel and approximately 1,300 patients had received the drug. This number do not include the early access program. If you include these, the number of patients receiving the drug increases to approximately 1,500.","Regarding Prevnar 13, revenues were down slightly across the global franchise. ACIP\u2019s updated recommendation in the U.S. for the vaccine for adults 65 and older, which is not effective until the publication of the morbidity and mortality weekly report, reinforces that Prevnar 13 is considered safe and effective by both, the FDA and ACIP. We look forward to successfully completing of the Phase 3 studies for our investigational 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate.","This candidate represents a potential significant advancements compared with a potential 15-valent by introducing all serotypes contained in PCV15 plus 5 additional serotypes. In sterile injectables, we are seeing our focus on manufacturing recovery taking shape. Global revenues increased 3% operationally and U.S. revenues increased 1% operationally. We continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.","Now let me moving to Upjohn. Revenues for our Upjohn business were down 26% operationally in the quarter. The decline was driven primarily by the expected significant volume declines in Lyrica in the U.S. due to multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019. Excluding the Lyrica impact, the decline would have been only 6% operationally.","Upjohn\u2019s China revenues increased 2% operationally. Despite the volume based procurement program in the 11 cities. Given these, we now expect Upjohn\u2019s full year 2019 revenues in China to grow by mid-to-high single digits compared with full year 2018, instead of low-to-mid single digit that we had predicted in our previous earnings call. Consumer Healthcare, the third quarter 2019 revenues totaled $377 million, down 54% operationally, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture transaction with GSK.","Turning now to R&D, we continue to be excited with the progress we are making with our pipeline, both in terms of the breadth of opportunities and the depth of the science. Since our last earnings call on July 29, we had seen some exciting milestones. In vaccines, we announced positive preliminary results from a proof of concept Phase 2 study of our investigational 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine under investigation for the prevention of invasive disease and otitis media in healthy infants.","Once data with the fourth dose are available, we intend to discuss Phase 3 plans with regulators. We also have completed enrollment in our three Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials evaluating our investigational 20-valent vaccine for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults, 18 years and older.","In rare diseases, we completed the transfer from Sangamo to Pfizer of the manufacturing processes for the investigational SB-525 gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. This month, we have enrolled the first patient in the lead-in trial of the Phase 3 clinical program. We expect to begin dosing patients for that trial in the first half of 2020. On October 21, Pfizer announced jointly with our partner OPKO that the global Phase 3 trial evaluating Somatrogon dose once weekly in pre-pubertal children with growth hormone deficiency met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to daily injectable Genotropin. We are very pleased with the results because this potential once weekly solution may offer significant benefits to patients. We are looking forward to presenting detailed data in a scientific conference and discussing them with the FDA and other regulators.","In Inflammation and Immunology, we recently announced positive top line results from JADE MONO-2. This was the second Phase 3 pivotal study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of our oral JAK1 inhibitor, Abrocitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These findings are in addition to the positive results for our first Phase 3 study with Abrocitinib in this indication where the full data were presented earlier this month at a medical conference.","In internal medicine, we recently entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Akcea Therapeutics for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The therapies currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We believe this novel therapy will complement our clinical mid-stage Internal Medicine pipeline and that our deep expertise in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases will help allow this program to reach its maximum potential for patients.","Lastly in Oncology, from our recent acquisition of Array, we presented interim analysis results from the Phase 3 BEACON trial of Braftovi\/Mektovi and cetuximab for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Braftovi combinations saw statistically significant improvements in overall survival and objective response rates versus control. We recently submitted to the FDA a supplementary new drug application with this data. And as per our user practice, we will announce their decision regarding acceptance for review.","And I am pleased to serve what we now have U.S. launch days for three of our biosimilars recently approved by the FDA. Zirabev is expected to launch on December 31 of this year 2019. Ruxience in January of 2020. And Trazimera on February 15 of 2020. So all the near future.","Of course, none of our breakthroughs will do patients any good if patients can\u2019t afford them. Pfizer remains committed to working with policymakers at both the federal and state levels and on both sides of the aisle on common sense solutions to improve patients\u2019 affordability.","We are making progress in certain areas. For example, our proposals regarding biosimilars have been well received and bipartisan legislation on this issue is advancing. We also continue to work with policymakers and others in the healthcare system to find ways to reduce out of pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, especially for seniors. We are particularly encouraged that lawmakers recognize the need for an annual out of pocket cap in Medicare Part D. And we are aggressively pursuing value based arrangements that tie reimbursement to the ability of our medicines to produce positive outcomes for patients.","While there has been a lot of discussion around the less constructive proposals. It\u2019s difficult to imagine Congress supporting policies that will explicitly stand in the way of life saving medicines being developed and made available to American patients. Therefore, we remain confident that common sense solutions can be found, but will drive continued innovation and benefit patients.","In summary, we turn in another solid quarter and our pipeline continues to be a source of great hope and excitement for our company, our shareholders and the patients who rely on our innovative medicines and vaccines. We also raised the midpoints for our 2019 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect our strong performance to date, as well as our confidence in the business going forward.","Frank will provide more details from this in a moment. Following the expected close of the Upjohn-Mylan transaction next year, Pfizer will be smaller, science-based company with a singular focus on innovative biopharma. All our current growth drivers and pipeline will remain with Pfizer for this reason. And we expect Pfizer\u2019s five-year revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%, and for that growth to begin immediately upon the close of the transaction. Our bio-pharmaceuticals group is already growing at a similar pace.","Starting in 2026, we will have a new set of LOEs, but we expect that the new wave of compounds currently in the pipeline along with the acquisitions of Therachon and Array Therapeutics, our equity interest in Vivet Therapeutics and the in-license investigational therapy from Akcea to help mitigate the impact of this LOEs. These agreements represent the types of targeted BD initiatives we will continue to pursue to help strengthen our substrate for the second half of the next decade.","These are deliberate moves we are making because of the confidence we have in our science, in our ability to commercialize important new medicines and vaccines and in our ability to continue to invest in growth while returning capital to investors.","Now, let me turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2019. Frank?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. The charts I\u2019m reviewing today are available on our website. Now moving on to business performance. Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 9% operational revenue growth in the third quarter of 2019 driven primarily by Ibrance globally, which recorded revenues of nearly $1.3 billion and operational increase of 27%. This was composed of 48% operational growth in international markets and 18% growth in the U.S.","Xeljanz globally up 40% operationally, primarily driven by 34% growth in the U.S. as well as 61% operational growth in international markets. Eliquis globally of 20% operationally, the hospital business up 9% operationally in emerging markets in the U.S., primarily driven by continued growth from anti-infective products in China in the November 2018 U.S. launch of Panzyga.","Vyndaqel with sales of $156 million in the quarter with $79 million in the U.S. following the launch for cardiomyopathy. And Inlyta in the U.S., where revenues increased to $139 million primarily driven by increased utilization in combination with certain checkpoint inhibitors for the first line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Partially offset primarily by lower revenues for Enbrel internationally, down 19% operationally, primarily reflecting continued biosimilar competition in most developed European markets. And Prevnar 13 in the U.S. down 7% due to lower government pediatric purchases in the third quarter of 2019 and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication.","Revenues for our Upjohn business in the third quarter decreased 26% operationally, primarily driven by the expected significant volume declines for Lyrica in the U.S. associated with multi-source generic competition that began in July of 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the U.S., third quarter 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 6% operationally, due to continued generic competition for certain off-patent products.","These results were partially offset by revenues in China up 2% operationally, primarily driven by volume growth for Lipitor and Norvasc and provinces with a volume based procurement program has not yet been implemented, as well as operational growth from Viagra and partially offset primarily by volume declines in unfavorable pricing impact in cities, where the VBP program was implemented in March of 2019.","Pfizer now expects Upjohn revenues in China to grow operationally by mid to high single digits for the full year of 2019 compared with 2018. Revenues for the consumer healthcare business in the third quarter are not comparable with the third quarter of last year, due to the completion of a consumer healthcare joint venture transaction with GlaxoSmithKline.","This quote is reporting reflects approximately one month of consumer healthcare domestic operations and approximately two months of consumer healthcare international operations versus third quarter of 2018 revenues, which reflect the full three months of consumer healthcare global operations.","In addition, Pfizer recognized an $8.1 billion pre-tax gain upon the completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture transaction, which reflects the difference in the fair value of Pfizer\u2019s 32% equity stake in the joint venture compared to the carrying value of its consumer healthcare business.","Finally, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by approximately 337 million shares to 5.65 billion versus the year ago quarter, primarily due to Pfizer\u2019s ongoing share repurchase program. Reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter 2019 revenues by approximately $215 million and adjusted cost of sales and positively impacted adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D expenses. In aggregate, foreign exchange had $0.02 per share negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter.","Moving on to 2019 financial guidance. We raised the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range for revenues by $200 million to $51.2 billion to $52.2 billion composed of $400 million of operational revenue growth, partially offset by a $200 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange.","Sorry for the technical problems, everyone. So let me continue, it\u2019s Frank. In addition, we now expect adjusted cost of sales to be in the range of 19.3% to 19.8%, adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion, adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.1 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.94 to $3 from $2.76 to $2.86, an increase of $0.16 since the previous quarter, reflecting an $0.18 operational improvement, partially offset by $0.02 unfavorable impact from recent changes in foreign exchange rates.","This guidance assumes diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 5.7 billion shares, which reflects the weighted average impact of share repurchases, totaling $8.9 billion executed in 2019. Dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs is currently expected to offset the reduction in shares associated with these share repurchases by approximately half. Our 2019 guidance for adjusted other income deducts in the effective tax rate on adjusted income did not change. We continue to expect adjusted other income deducts to be $200 million of income and the effective tax rate to be approximately 16%.","Now moving on to key takeaways. We delivered a strong quarter. Revenues with the Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group grew 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter, driven by Ibrance, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Vyndaqel, Inlyta and Xtandi. We updated our 2019 financial guidance, increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.18 operationally. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $14.9 billion to shareholders through the third quarter, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Albert and Frank for the prepared comments. Operator, can we please move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much for the questions. I guess just two here. First, I know you\u2019re not giving 2020 guidance at this point, but relative to your initial 2020 comments made with Upjohn, maybe just give us any \u2013 just flavor in terms of business trends or any franchises that are performing ahead or behind maybe some of the initial expectations?","And my second question was about kind of the next wave of pipeline opportunities. It \u2013 because it seems to me, when I hear the enthusiasm you have about that pipeline, that there is a bit of a disconnect between Street expectations and Pfizer expectations on the pipeline. So when you look at that portfolio, are there assets in particular where you see a particular \u2013 a gap relative to, I guess, what we\u2019re thinking versus your expectations as we kind of focus in on some of these updates over the next few years? Thanks so much.","Albert Bourla","Well, thank you, Chris. Let me try to speak a little bit about your question on guidance of next year, and then I will ask also Frank to help me on that, and then we\u2019ll ask Mikael Dolsten to speak about pipeline. Let me start with the 2020 guidance. We don\u2019t give guidance up before our Board approves our operating plan. And this every year happens in the mid of December of 2000 \u2013 of every year. And usually, we do it in the next earnings call that happen in January. This year, in the mid of the year, in July, because of the transaction, we had to provide some financial targets for Upjohn.","As a result, we felt that it\u2019s going to be awkward if we do not give also some financial targets for the RemainCo in 2020. But of course, we did that with a lot of unknowns and with great distance from the year of 2020. So we were appropriately cautious, I would say. Since then, a lot of things happened and happened in the areas that wanted to see how things could perform. For example, we were not certain how the ACIP recommendation for Prevnar would affect the adult business.","We were not certain how the label for Xeljanz \u2013 in the black box that we received, in the change in the label for Xeljanz, how that would affect the prescription habits of physicians. We were not sure how Ibrance effort that started in the beginning of this year to increase the market size rather than focus on increasing our own markets are offering, and \u2013 but have given very good results in the second quarter. We\u2019ll continue as we go into the third quarter. We were not certain how the newly approved Inlyta compared to BAVENCIO together with BAVENCIO and together with KEYTRUDA indication will transform into performance into the market.","And we were not certain how Xtandi new indications will perform and also how the new product, which is our Vyndaqel in cardiomyopathy, eventually will do. As a fact of the matter, all six of them did much better than what we were expecting. And this is extremely, extremely positive, of course. We are not going provide now a guidance for next year, but definitely, things have improved compared to what we thought in the second quarter.","Moving to Upjohn. Also, the same sentiment. We have provided $7.5 billion to $8 billion for next year, and we have said that we\u2019ve spent way significantly lower than what Upjohn is doing now because we wanted to make sure that we incorporate the impact predominantly in China of the volume-based procurement system. And for the same reasons, we said that the second half of this year will be lower and \u2013 but we\u2019ll try our growth in China in general to be low to single digits growth for China \u2013 digits for China.","In fact, we\u2019re upgrading that now. And we are saying that for this year, our growth will be mid to high digits growth in China portion of the Upjohn business. And again, we are not going to provide guidance for 2020 for Upjohn, but we will do that together with the total company in \u2013 after our Board approves in mid-December. But we have updated the guidance for this year obviously because of the very good results for the third quarter. Frank, anything to add to that, please?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","I would just add two things. One, our current expectations is we would provide guidance for 2020 like we typically do on our fourth quarter earnings call. But the only other thing I would add is \u2013 but please understand that we intend to improve upon the 2020 numbers that we\u2019ve previously issued that we talked about that we\u2019re appropriately cautious for the reasons that Albert discussed.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Now from the financials, let\u2019s go to things that are driving the financials, which is our \u2013 strength of our pipeline. So Mikael Dolsten, please go ahead.","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you, Albert. So let me say a few words. First, we have a large and strong pipeline with [indiscernible] projects from Phase 1 through registration, and the uptick is contribution from all of our five therapeutic areas. And it is driven by multiple science franchises and not dependent on one or two vulnerable compounds. Number two, our R&D productivity have improved consistently over the last two years.","Let me exemplify with our Phase 2 success rates have now been exceeding 40% for a number of years well above the benchmark. We estimate that earlier between 2018 and 2022, 25 to 30 approvals from 2018 to year-to-date, we\u2019re already at 11. Within that approval wave, let me exemplify our focus on the 15 in five strategy to deliver blockbuster approvals. And within that cohort as you have seen, we have had really good progress. And both Phase 2 and Phase 3 success rates are high and robust in also this most valuable compound.","Now I wanted to conclude and give you more of near-term opportunities for our pipeline. So between now and 2020, you may want to remember the metrics, 15 plus 10 plus 5 plus 5. 15 relates to 15 POC readouts, up to 15 POC readouts; 10 to \u2013 10 Phase 3 starts; and then 5 for 5 Phase 3 readout and 5 key approvals.","Let me give you a few examples on the POCs that you can keep an eye on. We have five different POC \u2013 up to five different POC readouts in our JAK franchise, including indications across topical \u2013 atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo and also psoriatic arthritis for an oral drug. We have a strong momentum in our gene therapy platform. Albert mentioned in his introduction our factor-18 therapy where we are expecting soon a POC readout and have started to enroll for baseline characteristics in Phase 3.","We are progressing well with our DMD gene therapy, and we have reached proof of concept for our tissue factor pathway inhibitor monoclonal antibody. We\u2019re also going to strengthen our hemophilia and the Phase 3 plans are underway. In internal medicine, I want to punctuate the angiopoietin-L3 deal pending close that we expect to have a POC readout early next year. Our vaccine franchise also has a number of intriguing data sets to be shared. Obviously, the P&G pediatric [indiscernible] RSV maternal Phase 2 data next year followed by Phase 3 start pending data.","And also, in our meningococcal pentavalent vaccine, we have actually reached very promising Phase 2 readout and are reviewing them to be shared for a potential Phase 3 start. Finally, in our Oncology franchise, we have the readout next year expected for our ENCORE BRAF\/MEK fast line. We have data coming from our next-generation CDKs and from a HER2 breast cancer ADC. So as you can see, I exemplified some out of the many POC readouts coming from now to next year and just punctuate that, of course, late-stage pipeline to which you are more familiar with, major interesting things in 2020.","High on everyone\u2019s agenda is the Ibrance early breast cancer, which we strongly look forward to, and I feel encouraged and optimistic about the Xeljanz, ankylosing spondylitis, JAK1 in the comparator atopic dermatitis studies that is the final data set for them, moving to potential submission. And of course, the P&G adult. And I\u2019m sorry for \u2013 it\u2019s somewhat lengthy, but it actually reflected the many exciting things to happen from now to end of 2020.","Chris Schott","Thank you, Mikael.","Chuck Triano","Great, thank you. Can we move to the next question please, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions and congrats on a quarter. I want to touch upon three things today, if I may. First, Albert, there\u2019s been a lot of investor questions on whether Pfizer could potentially be interested in M&A to recover the EPS dilution because of Upjohn. I just wanted to ask where you shake out on that, the first one.","Secondly, on Upjohn, I noticed there was a S-4 filed yesterday where Pfizer\u2019s internal forecast was that Upjohn stays at $7.8 billion to $8 billion post 2020, even though there would have been a Lyrica patent expiry worth $800 million in Japan, and even though China, 4 plus in would have intensified. So my question is what\u2019s driving this potential $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of revenue shortfall to keep Upjohn stable at close to $8 billion post 2020?","And finally, on tafamidis. It\u2019s very encouraging to see you\u2019re already at 4,800 patients. And my question is, is it inconceivable that Pfizer could hit more than 40,000 patients diagnosed at peak? Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Excellent questions, Umer. So let me start with the M&A. Frank can cover the Upjohn forecast. And then of course, Angela will speak about tafamidis. On the M&A strategy, look, since the July of 2018, when I \u2013 as Chief Operating Officer of that time, I think I related this strategy going forward on several items including M&A strategy. We are very consistent. Right now we are poised for organic growth.","Our organic growth, we forecast to be, on a five years CAGR, 6%. I know the average expectation is even higher. This number, even this 6% of us, compared to the analyst expectations likely will position \u2013 it\u2019s not likely, it\u2019s positioning us compared to the data and our peer set, let\u2019s say, the top 10 to 15 companies in the industry, they\u2019ll be the second largest in terms \u2013 the second fastest-growing company in the next five years with a 6% in terms of rate.","And actually, there are a lot of this in terms of producing growth dollars because we are going to \u2013 of course, of our size, of course. So any efforts that we\u2019re going to do, I\u2019m not going to jeopardize that. So we are not \u2013 the name of the game for us, I can say this many times, it is top line growth. And M&A of scale, they have the tendency. One, very difficult to find someone that will not be accretive given that we are the second fastest in our growth.","And secondly, it is very instructive operationally. And we can always do in a large M&A, but we have a very clear window of opportunity now to get it right, with our pipeline, to get it right with our launches. As you can see, we are doing very well. I don\u2019t want to put that at risk. Our business development strategy will continue to be bolt-on that will have a focus on R&D. And when I speak about R&D, again, as I said before, I want to be very clear. We are looking for Phase 2 assets, ready Phase 2, ready Phase 3 assets that \u2013 like the ones that we did in the last fall. These are development activities that will provide revenues at the post 2026, 2027 period, when we start filling again some of the LOEs.","And we want to make sure that the 6% growth is sustainable over the decade, the whole decade rather than only for the first six, seven years of this decade. So this is our strategy, and we are not looking for a large M&A right now. And with that, I will move to Frank to speak a little bit about the Upjohn projections and what we had in our Board presentation, which I think is pretty much in line with what we gave as guidance for next year.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Yes. So for so Upjohn, the 2020 revenue number that we put out there was $7.5 billion to $8 billion. By the way, that number reflected the Lyrica LOE and it reflected the China VBP. In fact, we anticipated the expansion of the China VBP in that number in terms of expansion going from 11 cities, 12 provinces, 50% share to 70% share, that, that range anticipated the impact of VBP in China. So a couple of comments on how do we get to the rhythm of the numbers that you alluded to.","So first, think about this quarter. Upjohn in China this quarter-to-quarter grew 2%. How did it grow 2%? It basically was able to mitigate the impact of the procurement program with geographic expansion within the country. We believe that that\u2019s an opportunity that continues on a going-forward basis. We also believe that there\u2019s opportunities for that business in Emerging Markets outside of China and continuing opportunities for that business and the rest of the world, given the breadth of the portfolio is going to have, and quite frankly, the pipeline that the new company has on a going-forward basis. So that\u2019s why you get to the numbers that were put into the S-4.","Albert Bourla","And then, Angela, please, about tafamidis.","Angela Hwang","So thanks for the question. Certainly, we are extremely pleased with the diagnosis rates of ATTR-CM that we have seen to date, which is about 4% to 5%. But even with that, it\u2019s important to remember that it is still a severely underdiagnosed disease, and we have a long way to go in terms of achieving what we believe and our patients deserve. There are two aspects of this diagnosis. The first is suspicion or suspecting the disease, and the second is the ability to detect the disease.","As you know, because we\u2019ve spoken about this over the last several quarters, we have been intensely focused on our educational efforts to help physicians suspect the disease. And this has been helped by the recently published red flag symptoms, which make it easier for physicians to see the possible clinical symptoms of ATTR-CM and helping them to drive suspicion of this disease.","From there, we have been educating around the use of the scintigraphy as a noninvasive means to diagnose ATTR-CM. And we\u2019re pleased to see that to date, about 90% of our diagnosis is now being driven through scintigraphy. Scintigraphy, as you know, is a well-established imaging technique, and it\u2019s widely available across the U.S. in cardiology practices. Actually, we estimate about 15,000 of these diseases are available in cardiology practices throughout the country. And we\u2019re seeing then this willingness and the readiness of physicians to adopt ATTR-CM diagnosis through this mechanism.","I know that benchmarks that we have quoted in the past show that a diagnosis rate of about 30% to 50% is what most rare diseases have achieved up until now, and that is what drove our peak estimate. However, we are learning a tremendous amount every single day about this particular disease about what it takes to diagnose it. And certainly, we are focused on making sure that we can do better than that for our patients.","Umer Raffat","Great.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Angela. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just update us on the timing of the Ibrance adjuvant interim efficacy look? And second, I was hoping you could speak to the gross margin upside in the quarter in a little bit more detail and comment on the sustainability of strong gross margins. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Very interesting questions, David. I think, again, Mikael can provide an update on the timing of Ibrance. And of course, for margins, the master of margins improvements, Mr. Frank D\u2019Amelio. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. As \u2013 we tell in general not to be specific about interim analysis in any programs. We expect the program to run to completion in 2020. There is an interim analysis a little bit earlier in 2020, but, most likely, it will run to completion. And we remain optimistic about the outcome of the study based on Ibrance\u2019s very strong performance, more recently event supported by real world evidence data that was very favorable towards different aspects of progression-free survival and also robust on overall survival actually having hazard ration of less than 0.6, which probably is the strongest hazard ratio provided so far. And we will update that hazard ratio as the study matures. Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Mikael.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So Dave, I\u2019ll answer the gross margin question. I think I\u2019ll also just add in even though you didn\u2019t ask a little bit about operating margins, too. So on gross margins, let\u2019s do it based on cost of sales. If you look at our cost of sales year-over-year, Q3 2018, 20.1%; Q3 2019 19.4%. So directionally correct, right? Down on a year-over-year basis. What drove the improvement? Really a couple of things. One is some cost improvements that we were able to implement in our global supply chain organization. Obviously, our manufacturing plants and the like. And then secondly, we have some very favorable product mix, right? If you look at where our revenue growth was, alliance revenues were up 18% year-over-year. Ibrance grew. So \u2013 and then Vyndaqel.","So we had some very favorable product mix. If you look at our operating margin for the quarter, high 30s, approximately 30%. So if you look at the trending and then you think about going forward, one key on that operating margin rhythm will be the revenue growth. So obviously, we\u2019re saying now that we think 6% operational revenue growth going forward, that will clearly help our operating margins on a going-forward basis relative to what we have said back in July because we\u2019ll leverage that to the bottom line.","And so I mentioned earlier, clearly, our intent is to improve upon the numbers that we provided previously that we\u2019re cautious, appropriately cautious back in July. So net-net, we think we can improve upon the numbers we provided, and we\u2019ll give you all an update on that when we give our 2020 guidance.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. On your revenue guidance of a five-year CAGR of 6%, consensus is not at that level, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any big areas that jump out at you specifically as being mis-modeled by the analyst community in as much as you\u2019ve looked at that sort of thing. And then on abrocitinib, your JAK inhibitor, you\u2019re running a trial called JADE compare head-to-head versus Dupixent, always bold to take on a product head-to-head.","It looks like this trial should be reading out in December of this year, so coming up. I\u2019m wondering, what we should realistically expect from that, both in terms of efficacy and safety? It seems that at least on safety and tolerability, it almost can\u2019t look as good as Dupi because it\u2019s a small molecule JAK inhibitor, but maybe you can kind of tell us what you expect that trial will show.","Albert Bourla","Yes. I think the \u2013 again, the R&D question, I think, will go to Mikael. Just a brief comment, but, look, we speak about our numbers, right? And the 6% that we\u2019re providing for our numbers, we are very, very comfortable with this number. We want to make sure that we say what we do and we do what we say. So I don\u2019t want to jeopardize that.","So I\u2019m giving numbers that we feel very comfortable that we will achieve. I have seen a lot of reports of analysts that they are having higher numbers than that. That\u2019s why I referred to that. I\u2019m going to check what is the consensus on that. But as I said, I don\u2019t want to comment on other people\u2019s. You are going do your job and we are doing our job. We feel very comfortable on the 6%. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. Thank you very much for shedding light on the compare study. So we are very excited about that study as it concludes our potential filing material, including then aggregate safety data. It is a head-to-head against Dupixent \u2013 dupilumab Dupixent, and we felt that it\u2019s an important trial in the sense we expect both drugs to show tolerability and safety that are favorable. We expect abrocitinib, based on current historical comparison, to do very well on efficacy on clearance of skin.","And we have specifically an endpoint on itch relief, pruritus reduction, which is one of the critical, most patient-friendly, centered endpoints. And we expect, and I believe that abrocitinib would outperform Dupixent in a very clinical, meaningful manner as it has a strong, fast onset. And data available, although not head-to-head, showed that the JAK1 class not just performed better clinically so far, and head-to-head is the reason why we wanted to document that hypothesis, but there is also science behind it. It inhibits the Interleukin-31 that is a major itch mediator, which is not covered by Dupixent. So I hope that gave you some insight into our integers.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","And Tim, it\u2019s Frank. I just wanted to add to what Albert said. Remember, when the new company is formed between our Upjohn business and Mylan, RemainCo, our new Pfizer, is our Pfizer biopharma business. Our biopharma business this quarter grew 9%, the last couple of quarters grew 6%, 7%. So that approximately 6% that Albert gave, we\u2019ve been printing now literally for the last few quarters. And remember, when Newco was formed, new Pfizer, RemainCo keeps all of the growth drivers that we currently talk about on this call. So that portfolio, the momentum of that portfolio carries into the new Pfizer.","Albert Bourla","Very good points, Frank.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thank you. We move to our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a couple. First, for Mikael, the press release says that after three doses in infants, the safety of 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine is similar to Prevnar 13, but you don\u2019t say the efficacy is similar after three doses in terms of immune response due to 13 valents that they have in common. Can you comment on that point and the response to the additional seven valents? I know Prevnar 13 is a four-dose regimen, but you must have data after three doses. So that\u2019s the first question.","Second question for Frank. Should something draconian come out of Washington that overnight cut revenue by 10%, a 20% reduction in operating expenses would appear required to protect the bottom line. Could a 20% reduction in operating expenses be delivered? And if yes, would it take 6 months, 12 months or would it take much longer? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. We shared data on three immunizations. And it was a descriptive study, not powered for efficacy, but I \u2013 my take at this was, as in the press release, we had very robust rise in immune titer against all 20 serotypes. And at this stage, they look very similar to the PCV13 when you look at totality of data. And the immune titers also are supplemented by functional antibody responses that we\u2019re now obtaining that, again, look very robust for the PCV20 across all serotypes.","I wanted also to say that increasingly available epidemiology data strengthened the notion that the PCV20 has a very broad coverage, far exceeding PCV15 developed by a competitor, where do you look at the infant population, the adult population, U.S. or European major countries and whether you look at IPD and CAP. So we\u2019re very pleased with emerging data and increased insights into epidemiology that indicates this vaccine has the potential to provide the broadest ever coverage for a pneumococcal disease.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","And then, Steve, if there was some draconian action that resulted in a 10% impact on our revenue, which is a big number, then clearly we would have to revisit our cost structure. I mean, how could we not? In terms of how much we could do it, how quickly we would do it, quite frankly, we\u2019d have to work our way through that. But the short answer is we would clearly review our cost structure, every element of the cost structure, by the way, which we do all the time anyway, and then see what we have to do to deal with \u2013 quite frankly, what the model is \u2013 what the business model is going forward. A 10% decline in our revenues is a change in our business model. And then we\u2019d have to obviously look at that in terms of how we run our business on a going-forward basis.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi. Two questions if I may. Number one on Hospira, as you have stabilized that business in the manufacturing capabilities there. Wondering if you could help us understand to what extent there have been \u201clost revenues\u201d over the last two years that would \u2013 that you may have been able to have if Hospira had been at full capacity and that basically, what I\u2019m asking is, how much do you think you can recover going forward for Hospira and how quickly could that growth be achieved?","And then on the C. difficile vaccine, I think the Phase 3 was supposed to read out in 2020, but I think you just went through an interim analysis in the DSMB or the monitoring board suggested to expand that study, wondering when the readout for that Phase 3 will be now? Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Right. I think, Angela can answer the Hospira questions to say something for us, the manufacturing issues and the supply for Hospira created, I would say a lot of trust with our customer. This is for me the most important, okay. And that\u2019s why we took it very seriously and we were very transparent with them and we created also a hospital business unit, because this is mostly hospital products, so that can be very customer focused only on the hospitals, so that we can make sure that we had the relations, that we had before and make them very strong. And I have to say that we were very successful and what the customers appreciate the most was across products. Obviously there is business that we lost and we hope that we will recover most of it. Angela, what do you think?","Angela Hwang","Sure. I think the way I would think about the future growth of the hospital business unit and even Hospira would be in the following way. I think there is a portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the supply issues that we would recover. There is a portion that we wouldn\u2019t recover, but that isn\u2019t \u2013 I guess that\u2019s not the only source of growth, I think the way to think about growth also is what we\u2019re doing to continue to diversify that portfolio and to bring in new launches. You hear Frank talk about Panzyga, as one of those and in our pipeline and in our portfolio today, our continuous launches, both from a presentation and a device perspective as well as from the molecule perspective.","I think the other element of the hospital business unit that we also need to consider is the strong anti-infective portfolio that is part of that business unit. Those are sterile injectables and in that unit \u2013 in that portion of the business are a number of new launches that began a couple of years ago and are now launching globally. So that\u2019s how I would think about growth in that portfolio, is that it\u2019s not dependent purely on the replacement or the regaining of business. A portion of it is, but much more of it is dependent on new ventures and new spaces that we are venturing into.","Albert Bourla","Yes, Michael.","Mikael Dolsten","On the C. diff, yes, we were pleased with the aspect that safety and tolerability with regard as favorable at the interim analysis and clearly the futility analysis indicated that the study should continue. While we tried to target the high-risk patients for C. diff infection by looking at increased risk for contact with healthcare community or recent use of antibiotics, we are of course pioneers in this area of developing a vaccine for this urgent need for preventing what can be fatal C. diff infections.","So we\u2019ll use all our insights to learn today to make sure that we can continue and expand enrollment to follow the advice from the monitoring committee to make sure we can conclude this study as soon as possible. And of course, there is an urgency with 450,000 C. diff infections every year in U.S. and close to 30,000 of this and we\u2019ll do everything possible to accelerate the readout of the study and get the events. We clearly do accumulated events, although somewhat slower than we initially hoped, but rest assure that we will do everything we can to make sure the readout is coming as soon as possible and we will later update you with more firm aspects of that.","Chuck Triano","Thanks Michael. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Your portfolio is heavily exposed to high list price, heavy Part B expose drugs. I\u2019m obviously thinking about Ibrance, Inlyta, Xtandi so on and so forth. You mentioned \u2013 you welcomed the proposal to cap out of pocket spends under Medicare Part B, but within the same Finance Committee proposal, there is also an obligation for you to funds catastrophic coverage to the tune of 20% and even larger contribution from the plan sponsor.","So my question is what is your comfort level with that part of the proposal and to what extent do you think, particularly in crowded classes like the CDK 4\/6, the obligation on the plan providers to fund catastrophic coverage is going to further increased price competition in the segment?","And then the second question, if I quickly, historically in veiled against some of your competitors for basically holding Xeljanz into very treatment refractory settings, given sufficient of that rebate power, I\u2019m thinking particularly of Humira, what\u2019s your confidence level that you\u2019re going to be able to secure favorable market positions with JAKs, given drugs like Dupixent are going to be generating significant rebates for the PBMs in the commercial book of business by the time you hit the market? Many thanks.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much. Let me try to answer your question about the out of pocket and all these reforms in the Medicare that have been proposed. And then I will ask Angela to speak about Xeljanz. When it comes to price reforms there are things that we agree and are things that we do not agree. But I would tell you that we are fanatically in favor of reducing out-of-pocket cost for patients. Because right now the fundamental issue that drives this polarization in the political environment around healthcare, it is a real problem and the problem is that the Americans are paying for their medicines.","Like if they are nothing short, although they are having insurance, when they go to collect them from the counter of the pharmacist. This is not happening with the hospital, this is not happening with diagnostics, this is not happening with other medical intervention, at least to the degree, what was happening with medicines and this is why that drug pricing is so high in the debate, although they represents only 10%, 12% of the total healthcare cost. So that needs to be addressed.","Now the way that the Senate for example is proposing for aggressive or even worse through the house, they are going to increase the contribution of the pharmaceutical companies and of course this will help. But this is \u2013 the list of my problems overall, because at least what hurts us helps the patients. My issue with this bill, it is that a lot of other measures, but they\u2019re suggesting that hurt us even more. They are not moving the savings to the patients, which is the fundamental issue that, right now, society is dealing with and this is our efforts here.","I believe, that it is to the benefit of the industry, it is to the benefit of innovation, it is to the benefit of patients, it is to the benefit of the healthcare system to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses, either with a rebate reform or if that\u2019s not on the picture right now by reducing the \u2013 by implementing a cap for out-of-pocket, it is of paramount importance, even if you have to pay for it. And Xeljanz, Angela.","Angela Hwang","So it is true that when we look back the Xeljanz access has been challenging through time, but certainly we over the last several years have worked hard with our payers as well as our PBMs as well as amassing, I think some really strong scientific and patient experience and evidence behind Xeljanz, that is creating momentum for this particular product.","The I&I category generally is one that is the most heavily rebated and I think that we have demonstrated our ability to be a real solution in this space of great unmet need. And as evidenced just compared to last year this time, we now have 32 million more incremental lives in Medicare and commercial channels that have gained unrestricted access, and specifically in fact just this past May we gained an additional 8 million lives. So I think that this is sort of good evidence to show how we are working hand-in-hand with our payers as well as our PBMs to bring the totality of our data and our experience to bear. I\u2019m filling an area of great unmet need.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thanks, Angela. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Albert, you mentioned a few of your upcoming biosimilar launches, just wondering if you can help frame for us, the potential size of the opportunity as you think about the long-term there and maybe walk through some of the remaining hurdles in terms of establishing a robust biosimilars market in the U.S. And then Angela, just wondering any more color you can provide on the extended dynamics in terms of either share among the different segments or maybe mix of the prescriber base? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Let me speak a little bit about \u2013 generally about biosimilars, and then I will ask Angela to answer the second question and also specifics in the biosimilars potential of what we are going through. I think in the U.S., unlike other countries there is a problem with the system and the system is that there is \u2013 the fundamental issue that there is this rebate trough, but payers overall they do see the benefit of using biosimilar solution of what physicians would like to prescribe and that the FDA, saying that has similar efficacy and safety, and it is much cheaper. Although they want to do that, they are trapped and they cannot because they are going to lose the benefits or the rebates that the originator is offering.","And I think, frankly, that unless we resolve this big issue, we will never be able to see tremendous progress on biosimilars. So this is something, I think, that the political world is understanding. This is something that we are very vocal about it. This is something that we are discussing constantly with payers, who they want to move to new solutions, but they cannot. And I think that there is positive momentum on that, but still I agree, to be able to see transformational change in the penetration of biosimilars, so the health care system can see real lives.","Significant savings can only happen if we find a solution to that. We have also suggested other measures like the savings should be served by providers, et cetera, et cetera, but I think that\u2019s the fundamental one.","Now all biosimilars are not the same because \u2013 and not all markets are the same. Whether you have closed systems like the Kaiser, for example, the penetration of biosimilars is very, very high because they can see the benefit of doing something like that. But when you have intermediates being involved but then big rebates in play, it\u2019s very difficult for them to do.","And also, oncology is very different. Also, biosimilars from I&I are very similar because the I&I, they are giving for very extensive period of time, so you need to switch. New patients aren\u2019t coming very often. Oncology is very different because it\u2019s more limited the period that they are \u2013 that therapists use. And then the patients are coming much more often \u2013 New patients are coming much more often in higher proportion. But, Angela, maybe you want to add into that, and then also provide an answer to the second question.","Angela Hwang","Sure. I think Albert has said, much of it and maybe what I can add is the following. I think within the context of the fact that the U.S. dynamics are very different from the European dynamics, where you see a much greater adoption of biosimilars, what we have seen with our supportive care biosimilar, which is Retacrit, is that we\u2019ve seen some nice growth there.","To date, it has a 16% market share, which is the highest that we\u2019ve seen of any biosimilar here in the U.S. and I think that that tells us \u2013 and that\u2019s given us the opportunity to learn about what it will take to launch oncology biosimilars as well as what we can expect in this particular space. So I think with the three biosimilars coming within \u2013 one after the other December, January, February of end of this year, we look forward to driving the growth of this portfolio of biosimilars in an area of high unmet need for patients.","As it pertains to Xtandi, you do see a tremendous growth here this quarter. We had a great quarter growing 25% year-over-year, and I think that this is evidence of the great confidence that our prescribers, both neurologists and medical oncologists, are having with Xtandi. We have leading market share at 37% branded in a growing class and the plus as well has been one that has grown 3 points from last quarter to this quarter. So when we look at our sources of patients for Xtandi, they come in two forms. First, it\u2019s the non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, where we continue to see increases, both in total patients as well as new patient starts since the PROSPER approval.","And just as a measure of PROSPER, urologists are generally the prescribers in an earlier disease setting, and here urology prescribing is growing at 44%. And so we\u2019re continuing to see the proportion of our business from PROSPER growth very positively. Also to remember that these patients are earlier in terms of their course of disease and therefore have higher days of therapy. So this will drive the prescriptions and the revenues.","In metastatic CRPC, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, which is still the majority of our business. Our new patient share continues to increase there too. And here, we not only have the number one share of voice with oncologists, but our prescribing with oncology \u2013 medical oncology continues to grow significantly as well in this quarter at 21%. And so when you bring all of this together and you add into that the approval and\/or the positive Phase 3 results we got from Ezimet and the submissions that we have for additional indications in both the non-metastatic, the hormone-sensitive setting as well as additional data from the inbox study. I think that what we have in Xtandi is a uniquely positioned NHT that is going to be able to treat multiple indications in both hormone-sensitive as well as castrate-resistant prostate cancer.","Chuck Triano","Excellent, thanks Angela. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is that in consensus there is a meaningful step up in Ibrance sales through 2023. And do you think you can grow Ibrance double digits without an adjuvant or neoadjuvant approval? And then second question I had is on abrocitinib, based on the safety data that you\u2019ve seen thus far, is there a chance that you will not get a black box warning like other JAK15 in the industry? And then last question I had was if you could give an update on your DMD program, where you stand today, the competitiveness of your program versus some of the other ones out there, based on the data that you\u2019ve seen thus far? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Yes. A quick answer on the Ibrance, and then I think abrocitinib and DMD will be covered by Mikael. Again, in the spirit that I don\u2019t want to comment what is the analysts expectations, I know what they are, and they\u2019re our expectations. And we are projecting that we will grow Ibrance to double digit, and, therefore, also expecting that we will receive the \u2013 that we will have, let\u2019s say, a positive PALACE study, which is the main study that is driving expansion of prescriptions and drivers.","So, of course, everything is risk-adjusted in our projections. And some will be positive, some will be negative, but the 6% that we are taking because the ratio on all of that is not based on one or two, but is based on risk adjustment of multiple. So we are feeling very comfortable that, overall, we will not say bad because if another fails, another one would succeed. And that one will derisk the revenue. So we\u2019ll be much higher. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So starting with abrocitinib. I think it\u2019s a good question, you raised here that each JAK inhibitor are different and we designed our JAK inhibitors for optimal use depending on the condition, and it\u2019s hard for me to express a strong view here on the potential black box as it\u2019s really the decision of the FDA. I can only say that we have so far seen a very good safety profile and we have not seen any cardiovascular signals at all with this drug.","And as you\u2019ve seen in our reported trials, efficacy has been very persuasive and strong. So we look forward to finalize the program, generate the compare data that could show potential advantages with faster onset versus standard of care Dupixent and then have a dialog with FDA. The DMD program, we are continuing dosing patients and we reported at the PPMD Conference that we had transduced more than 70% of the muscle fibers and expressed mean dystrophin at 30% of normal that we think is in the range that where you should see benefit.","Interestingly, we also shared with you, using the North Star Ambulatory Activity Scale that we had two patients, where we saw a benefit in increased performance. And please remember, these patients were older than patient reported by other players in the field, and older patients are the harder is to show benefit as the natural history is to decline. So we are concluding, we hope to start in a relative short time frame and pending final data set, we are preparing for start of Phase 3 next year. And hope certainly that these type of therapy can transform patients\u2019 lives for these poor boys.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Michael. And operator, can we take our last question please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys, thanks for the question. Just had a few. Angela for Vyndaqel, I just want to get a little bit more detail on the rollout in the U.S. Obviously, I know it\u2019s early, but from the field, how would you characterize reimbursement and access and other commercial lessons to be learned from the EU? And then, Albert, just to put a finer point on your comments for long-term growth and deals. I mean, when you look at the LOE starting in 2026, you mentioned the pipeline readouts as a clearly an offset, but can that or smaller tuck-in deals be enough to still get you to growth over the course of the decade? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Angela?","Angela Hwang","Great. So from a reimbursement perspective, I think that we are seeing things pan out exactly as we thought. As you know, the large majority of our patients would be Medicare patients because the \u2013 just the age and the prevalence of the disease in this particular population. But currently, we\u2019re seeing about 80% of our patients in the Medicare bucket, about 12% in the commercial lives bucket and then of the remainder in Medicaid and others.","And so anticipating that this would be sort of how the patient \u2013 I guess the patient mix would look. We created at the launch of Vyndaqel, a number of programs to support the reimbursement of Vyndaqel. And, so for example, in the commercial patients, we have a co-pay card, a co-pay assistance program. For all patients, we have a bridge program to ensure that patients can receive access to Vyndaqel, while they\u2019re waiting for their reimbursement decisions.","And for Medicare patients, we\u2019re exploring \u2013 we\u2019re in the process of exploring a number of ways that we can help lower co-pay costs for Medicare patients including working with payers on innovative contracting approaches, which will then help to lower their co-pay. And then of course there is always a portion of patients that are on our free drug program.","But I think all in all, what we\u2019re learning from these early days in the market, is that the solutions that we have are definitely supporting our patients in the way that they need, and then not to forget, we still have the support from the Pfizer\u2019s patient hub as well as a number of specialty pharmacies and hospitals that actually provide our patients with all the support they need to clear that prior authorizations. And I think that this service has been hugely helpful in helping us to clear prior auths and get our patients on drug as soon as possible.","Albert Bourla","And Geoff, to your question about if we believe that this growth going to be sustainable in the post 25, 26 period? The answer is yes. Look, it is normal for companies, who have LOEs. What is abnormal is not to have LOEs, but it is normal for companies to have LOEs and ourselves, we will come back to normality, actually not even in 26. 26 is a very small number of LOEs. From 27, we are coming back to normal LOEs as a percentage of sales. And then this we need to with everything that we know right now, normal in 27. So this is 8 years from now, right. So I feel very comfortable, but we will have enough time and we have a pipeline that is very diversified and we have a strategy that is doubled down only to develop substrate that will deliver on that. So when the Company\u2019s on normality, we\u2019ll be able to continue growing at the same rate that we are growing right now.","So I think that\u2019s the end, right? It\u2019s like, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have time. We exceeded our time. So I want to thank you all for joining us today. I liked a lot this call. There were fewer questions on financials because they were stellar, of course. And we devoted most of the time to the pipeline, which is exactly what we want to do, and to the growth drivers of the business, which is exactly what an earnings call of a successful pharmaceuticals company should look like. Now as we move toward the expected close of the Upjohn-Mylan transaction next year, I expect that both businesses will be significantly strengthened.","We expect Pfizer to remain positioned to deliver top and bottom line growth, that it\u2019s among the industry leaders. And you know us. We want to be the leader, so we will aim for that. And by bringing together Mylan\u2019s growth products into Upjohn\u2019s growth markets, we are creating the leading off-patent drug company with a strong financial profile and true global reach. All these reasons, it is an exciting time for our company, and we will remain highly focused on executing against these strategies. So thank you very much. Have a great rest of the day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2019 performance and 2019 financial guidance. I am joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang; Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Commercial Officer;and Doug Lankler General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our Web site earlier this morning and are available at Pfizer.com\/investors. We'll see here that slide three covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we'll move to a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone. It's been a busy and productive first few months as CEO. I've had the pleasure of meeting with many of you to discuss Pfizer's long-term growth prospects. I have also met with thousands of colleagues from around the world. All of them are committed to driving sustainable growth through scientific and commercial innovation, all in creating capital allocation and a renewed focus on our purpose, breakthroughs that change patient's life.","I'm pleased to report that we began the year with a strong first quarter. Revenues were up 5% operationally companywide. This was driven by 8% volume growth, offset by net pricing decline of 3%. If we look at our Biopharmaceuticals Groups, which represented 70% of our revenue base this quarter, we generated a strong 11% volume growth, and realized a net pricing decline of 3%. We saw volume growth in several key brands, emerging markets and biosimilars, and we got our Upjohn business up and running.","Let's begin with our result also from the Biopharmaceuticals Group. This business grew its top line 7% operationally, due primarily to the continued strength of several key brands, including Eliquis, Ibrance, Prevnar 13, and Xeljanz. Eliquis had a strong start to the year, growing its revenues by 36% operationally in the quarter. Eliquis continues to extend its leadership in many major geographies around the world, and in the U.S. we achieved an all-time high prescription served [ph] for the brand this quarter.","We remain pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Global revenues in the first quarter increased 25% operationally to $1.1 billion. As you know, the Ibrance growth story is now predominantly in international markets, where we saw 107% operational growth in the quarter. This was driven by continued strong uptake in developed Europe, Japan, and certain emerging markets. In the U.S., we saw 2% growth which reflected continued moderating volumes in approved metastatic breast cancer indications.","Prevnar 13 revenues increased 10% operationally. We saw 31% operational growth in emerging markets, due primarily to favorable overall impact and increased volume associated with government purchases. These gains were partially offset by the non-recurrence of volumes associated with an adult national immunization program in the first quarter of 2018. We saw 6% growth in the U.S., driven by increased government purchases for the pediatric indication, partially offset by lower sales of the adult indication.","Regarding the upcoming ACIP Meeting in the U.S., we continue to believe that maintaining a current age-based recommendation for adults would prevent numerous cases of pneumococcal pneumonia as well as that the related hospitalizations and outpatients frequency.","Xeljanz continues to perform well. Revenues in the quarter increased 34% operationally to $423 million. Volume growth in the U.S. was strong, aided by the recent addition of new indications. While we are in the early days for both launches, 6% of the 38% volume growth in the U.S. came from psoriatic arthritis, and 7% came from ulcerative colitis. So, 30% of the total volume growth came from new indications. We look forward to these new indications potentially becoming even more meaningful contributors in the future.","For Xtandi, alliance revenues in the U.S. grew 6% operationally to $168 million. We believe our growth labeled indication as well as the potential for new indications represent a major opportunity to make a significant impact on patient's lives and change the standard of care in prostate cancer.","Revenues from our biosimilars portfolio grew 7% operationally in the quarter. We received regulatory approvals during the quarter for two oncology biosimilars, and we see the potential for additional approvals in key markets later this year.","In sterile injectables, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top line in the U.S. We have made some progress towards fixing these issues, particularly since [indiscernible] responsibility for our global supplier organization on November 1, 2018. We expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019, and continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.","Our Upjohn business revenues grew 1% operationally in the quarter. Emerging markets were the primary driver, including strong volume-driven operational growth in China for such branches, Lipitor, Norvasc, and Celebrex. These gains were partially offset by lower revenues for Viagra, and Pfizer's authorized generic for Viagra in the U.S, and for Greenstone, Upjohn's authorized generic subsidiary, primarily due to continued industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. generic space. With its streamlined operating structure, relative in autonomy and its leadership located in China, we believe Upjohn will help us seize the tremendous opportunity we see in the emerging months. As the global middle-class continues to rapidly expand, and as awareness and diagnosis and treatment options continue to improve, we believe the Pharmaceutical segment will continue to enjoy significant expansion in Greater China and other emerging markets.","Pfizer's consumer healthcare revenues were down 2% operationally in the quarter. This reflected an 8% decline in the U.S., due in part to a milder-than-expected cold and cough season. This decline was partially offset by 4% operational growth in international markets.","Turning now to R&D, today we released our latest pipeline update, which you can see on this slide. We are very encouraged by our pipeline, both in terms of the breadth of opportunities and the science, and while we have said that we expect our 2019 adjusted EPS to be essentially flat operationally, compared with last year, due to the [indiscernible], we believe a look at our pipeline will help bring our expected Costa Rica growth drivers into clearer focus.","Since the beginning of 2019, we have already received five approvals; EU approvals for ZIRABEV, a biosimilar to Avastin for treatment of multiple forms of advanced or metastatic cancer, and for VIZIMPRO for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for Trazimera, a biosimilar to Herceptin for the treatment of certain forms of breast and gastric cancer, and for Ibrance for the previously underserved male breast cancer population. The Ibrance line extension marks the first time that Pfizer medicine has received an expanded indication based on the real-world evidence. And in Japan, we received approval for Tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy.","As you can see in this next slide, we have a diverse range of assets spanning from Phase 2 through registration and the cap across each of our areas of their own. Overall, we are thrilled with the depth and breadth of our pipeline as we are not overly reliant on a single pipeline opportunity. As you know, we announced our up to 15 in five cohorts almost two years ago. I'm pleased to say that we are making good progress, despite experiencing some attrition, which is to be expected.","Let me touch on just a few of the recent and upcoming milestones. I'll start with oncology. Data from our JAVELIN Renal 101 trial saw the combination of Bavencio and Inlyta significantly extended medium PFS by more than five months compared with second. As a first line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. We could file this data with the FDA with the PDUFA date in June.","With Keytruda plus Inlyta having been approved earlier this month, Bavencio will become the second Inlyta combination available to patients with advanced OA. We are preparing to submit our extended IMS data in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in the coming months and in 2020, we expect to have data from a Phase 3 EMBARK trial starting expanding for high risk hormone sensitive prostate cancer as well as from two Phase 3 trials evaluating burns in early stage breast cancer.","We recently presented data that faces study of our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for adults aged 18 years and older. We're now in Phase 3 if the data is supportive. We expect to file by the end of 2020. We also expect Phase 2 data from the infant studies later this year. This our Phase 3 C-difficile vaccine studies now fully enrolled with pivotal data expected next year. In inflammation and immunology, we expect our first Phase 3 data results in May for our JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis as well as additional results in the second half of the year. Our JAK3 inhibitor for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata which started a Phase 2b\/3 trial in December had also received breakthrough therapy designation and the pivotal readout is expected in the second half of 2021.","In internal medicine on April 18, we announced the results of the long-term osteoarthritis study for Tanezumab. As we stated in the press release, we are analyzing the strength in the context of the recent Phase 3 results as we assess potential next steps for this medicine. We plan to review the totality of data from our clinical development programs for Tanezumab with regulatory authorities. Why we are very focused on continuing to advance our up to 15 and 5 cohorts, I also want to provide an update on some of the exciting areas in earlier stages of development that we are pursuing.","These areas combine novel science and significant unmet medical needs. You can see several areas in the chart but today I will highlight three from the rare diseases space. Earlier this month along with our partner Sangamo Therapeutics, Pfizer announced interim data from the Phase 1\/2 study indicating that SB-525 would generally well tolerated and demonstrated at dose dependent increasing Factor 8 levels across the four doses cohorts in hemophilia basis.","Based on these results, the Safety Monitoring Committee recommended cohort expansion at the high dose, it marks Pfizer acquired a 15% equity interesting in Vivet Therapeutics, a privately held company dedicated to developing gene therapy treatments for inherited liver disorders. Pfizer and Vivet will collaborate on the development of VTX-801, Vivet's proprietary candidate for the treatment of Wilson's disease.","At the upcoming PPMD Annual Conference in June, we expect to report data on our investigational mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate for the same muscular dystrophy. We will continue to explore both internal and external opportunities for the next generation of breakthroughs.","At Pfizer, we are keenly aware that the breakthrough rules coming out of our pipeline won't mean anything if people can't afford them, but so why we continue to work with policymakers, payers, providers, and other participants in the healthcare system to find solutions to patients and portability. If you haven't already seen it, I would encourage you to read my testimony from the February 26 Senate Finance Committee hearing on affordable access to medicines, it outlines four proposals that we believe will derive meaningful reductions in costs patients.","In summary, Pfizer is off to a very good start in 2019. We deliver strong financial performance, while reaching millions of people around the world with our medicines and vaccines. Our new commercial structure is designed to maximize today's revenue growth opportunities, while transitioning the company to a period post 2020, where we expect higher and more sustained revenue growth profile. We remain focused on executing on our commercial strategies, managing expenses, advancing our pipeline, and prudently allocating our capital to position Pfizer for sustainable success.","And now, I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter, and our outlook for 2019.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now moving on to the financials, first quarter 2019 revenues were approximately $13.1 billion, which reflects operational growth of $664 million or 5%. And the unfavorable impact the foreign exchange of $453 million or 4%.","Our biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 7% operational revenue growth in the first quarter, driven primarily by Eliquis and Xeljanz globally, Ibrance primarily in international markets, and Prevnar 13 and emerging markets in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by the clients in our hospital and rare disease businesses.","Revenues for our Upjohn business in the first quarter increased 1% operationally, primarily due to 25% operational growth and emerging markets, driven by strong value driven operational growth in China, primarily from Lipitor, Norvasc, and Celebrex partially offset by a 9% operational decline in developed markets primarily driven by lower revenues for Viagra and Upjohn's authorized generic for Viagra in the U.S. due to increased recent generic competition; Lyrica, primarily due to lower volumes in the U.S. and wholesaler de-stocking in advance of anticipated generic competition, beginning June 30, and in developed Europe from continued generic competition, and Greenstone Upjohn's authorized generic subsidiary, primarily due to industry wide pricing challenges in the U.S. Revenues of our consumer healthcare business declined 2% operationally reflecting an 8% decline in the U.S. partially offset by 4% operational growth in international markets.","In the first quarter, we recorded gap earnings per share of $0.68. A $0.09 increase compared to the year ago quarter, which is primarily due to the favorable impact of higher revenues in the first quarter of 2019 compared to last year, lower purchase accounting adjustments, fewer shares outstanding, which will partially offset by foreign exchange, higher asset impairment charges and higher net losses on the early retirement, certain outstanding debt securities.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.85 versus $0.75 in a year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, fewer shares outstanding due partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange compared to the year ago quarter.","Finally, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by $307 million shares versus the year ago quarter, primarily due to our Sherry purchase activity in 2018. As well as our first quarter 2019 share repurchases, which totaled $8.9 billion and included our $6.8 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. This was partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.","As I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter 2019 revenues by approximately $453 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $315 million. As a result, foreign exchange had a $0.02 per share negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter.","Moving on to 2019 financial guidance, we reaffirmed our 2019 financial guidance for revenues. Two items to note. Our financial guidance continues to assume that the age-based recommendation for Prevnar 13 in adults is maintained by the ACIP on a vote in late June 2019. And our guidance continues to reflect expected headwinds in China due to pricing reform which is now being implemented.","We increased guidance for adjusted other income by $100 million primarily due to millstone income recorded in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, we increased the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.01 to an updated range of $2.83 - $2.93. This is the net impact of a $0.03 per share operational increase primarily due to the aforementioned adjusted other income and some smaller favorable adjustments within our other guidance ranges partially offset a $0.02 per share impact due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid January 2019.","Moving on to key takeaways, we delivered strong first quarter financial results with 5% operational revenue growth and 13% adjusted diluted EPS growth compared to the year ago quarter. We raised our 2019 financial guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS by 0.01, reflecting a $0.03 operational increase partially offset by a $0.02 unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates since mid January 2019. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update. And we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividend. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Frank and Albert for you prepared remarks. At this point, we would like to move to our Q&A session please. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions please. On your 20-valent Prevnar follow-on, I am hoping you can talk about when you expect that to move in the pediatrics? It's your largest product Prevnar 13. It's a race between you and Merck to come up with a new and improved version of Prevnar 13. You guys are the incumbent, yet you are not yet in phase 3 in peds, and Merck is. I am wondering if that potentially foretells if there is some sort of formulation problems with your product in peds. So asking for assurances that there are.","Second question is on Ibrance and just the longer term international opportunity if you look at major cancer drug precedent in the past by their companies, lot of the times those product sell more outside the U.S. eventually than they do in the U.S. Wondering if that could happen here with Ibrance in the CDK 4\/6 class because that's not how it's being modeled, or has there been too money price concessions made such that it's not really achievable? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Tim, thank you very much. Both excellent questions; I will ask Mikael to address the question on our 20-valent compared to 15-valent from the Merck? And then Angela will answer the question about Ibrance. So that, Mike?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, thank you. We are very pleased with our 2-valent pnuemo next generation vaccine that covers the certain stereotypes of Prevnar 13 plus seven new ones. These seven new ones were careful selected to make sure we have a broad coverage of emerging invasive pneumococcal disease strains associated with high case fatality rates and antibiotic-resistance in some cases combined with meningitis.","We communicated our adult data at the ECCMID Conference recently which showed a compelling profile which also of course was linked to the breakthrough designation by FDA. We are moving with good and robust pace forward in the pediatric settings. As you know, in the pediatric settings, we have multiple immunization as well as a boost as is the current regimen for use of conjugate vaccines which is different from the adult trial that are fast as it's only one immunization.","We look forward to read out from the infant trial need to of this year in phase 2 proof-of-concept study, and pending review those data sets, we look forward to interaction with regulatory agency and swift moving forward into a potential pivotal start. We are very pleased with the formulation. It was very well-tolerated this far and think we have included all experiences from decades of pneumococcal work into our plan.","Albert Bourla","And I would like also to remind that we have a very strong patent portfolios on Prevnar. Angela, would you like to address the question with Ibrance please?","Angela Hwang","Thank you. Ibrance revenue growth continues to be very strong ex-U.S. And you heard Albert mentioned in his opening remarks that currently we are growing at 107% in Q1 of 2019. We believe this growth to be sustainable as we see that there is still significant room to grow in this CDK class as well as our own market share. Just as an example in the EU 5 this CDK class is currently 35% of all first-line new patient starts while we have 86% Ibrance class share.","In Japan, as an example, this CDK class is only 21% first-line new patient starts and a 100% of the Ibrance class share. So while we are continuing build our Japan and EU business, we will also intensely focus on our launches in the emerging markets. So far, we have seen 122% operational growth year-on-year in the emerging markets, and led by double digit growth that we are seeing in Argentina, India, Saudi Arabia as an example. We have launches coming up both in Brazil and China which we are very excited about, and we expect these to be very strong contributors to our 2019 growth trajectory. So, in view of the three big [ph] phases of growth of Ibrance, the first being the U.S., which is where we began with our first indication. Now in our international launches which are moving beyond the developed markets to the emerging markets. And then the anticipation of our adjuvant indications to come with Ibrance, we continue to be extremely optimistic, and I feel very positive about the growth trajectory of Ibrance.","Albert Bourla","Great. Thanks, Angela. Next question please, Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first on extending the sales there were a little lighter than we thought and just wondering if there is any onetime item. The prescription trend also seemed a little lower last quarter than what we were seeing in the past. So, comments there. And then just maybe outlook for that product longer term, I know you have expanded label and new indications coming, so just so you could frame how you see that longer term?","And then second on the DMD data you mentioned coming in June. It's interesting a lot of focus on that even though it's pretty early day. So maybe if you could just sort of help sort of frame expectations around that in terms of what we will actually see and what we should be expecting going into just so people sort of have appropriate expectations given that it is such early data. Thanks.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much, Vamil. Angela, I think you can cover the Xtandi question, and then, John, if you can please discuss the DMD data on [indiscernible]?","Angela Hwang","Thank you. Well, we have seen very strong prescriber adoption of Xtandi across all of our indications. I think that this demonstrates the confidence that prescribers have with Xtandi. Year-on-year urologists have prescribed -- prescribing has grown 45%. And oncology prescribing has grown 20%. We are also pleased with the uptake of Xtandi in non-metastatic CRPC. This is our PROSPER trial. Even though this was launched just eight months ago, its market share is already equivalent to our metastatic indication which was launched seven years ago. And this market share is more than doubled that of a leader in non-metastatic CRPC. We have yet to realize the full potential of PROSPER, because the impact of patient accumulation and the longer days of therapy are still to come, and just as a reminder, the days of therapy for the PROSPER trial is 18 months. This quarter, as you say, the U.S. net revenue did lag behind total patient demand. But this was due to some gross to net adjustments, some inventory differences, and our free drug program. But we continue to believe in the strong growth potential of all of our indications, and we look forward to our indication from both the ARCHES and the EMBARK Trials, which will continue to drive growth through expansion into new patient segments and offer longer [ph] days of therapy. So we need to stay the course with our strategies, and we believe the impact from PROSPER as well as our new indications will drive future growth, change the standard of care, and meet high patient unmet needs.","John Young","Thanks. Hi, Vamil. So thanks for the question about our own DMD program. So Albert obviously touched on this in his prepared remarks and just to emphasize again we are going to be presenting data from mini-dystrophin DMD gene therapy candidate at the PPMD meeting in Orlando, which is at the end of June. For our DMD program, the first patient was dosed with an infusion of the mini-dystrophin gene therapy in March of 2018. In total, six patients have been treated in two dose groups, one E14 and three E14 dose regimens. Part of the trial protocol, muscle biopsies were to be taken at baseline two months post treatment and 12 months post treatment. And to the extent that that biopsy data is available and mature, it will be presented at PPMD. We also intend to present an update on the safety profile of this therapy at PPMD and we are excited to present the data and obviously particularly to continue to work with the DMD community for a disease that is so devastating for so many boys [ph] with this condition.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, John. It's a devastating disease, and we all hope that the solution that we are working and others, but the solution that we are working would be really transformational. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan.","Chris Schott","Thanks very much. Just two bigger picture questions, I guess, the first one with the progress you've been seeing on the pipeline, can you just update us in terms of where you see business development fitting into the longer term view and strategy for the company. I guess, specifically, I think you have been clear that larger deals are off the table for now, but when we think about bolt-ons, what type of size of deal could that encompass and what are the latest priorities in terms of commercial stage assets versus clinical assets et cetera? And my second question with the Upjohn division, do you believe it would be possible to eventually separate and spin this division from the rest of Pfizer and if so what are the factors and kind of data points we need to be watching that would make that type of separation something that would be possible at the time? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Yes. With the business development, I will ask John to comment and you have heard our comments that we plan to invest significantly in business development. It's a little bit different, the way that we plan to do it right now. Before we were targeting revenues, now or soon -- right now, the focus, it is how to -- and because this is what we needed at the time. And now our growth, I think organically is going to be robust post 2020. So what we are looking for, it is to enhance even further our pipeline. So, as regards the direction in how we are selecting clinical, John, can you please make a comment? John has the responsibility of managing this strategic area for us.","John Young","All right. Thanks, Albert, and thanks Chris for the question. So I wouldn't repeat what Albert has already said about the reorientation of our focus of [indiscernible] opportunities to really strengthening our pipeline with clinical stage assets. I think, if you were to look into the future, I think you'll see us continue to be very active in business development, but I think with our focus generally on earlier to mid stage opportunities where clinical risk may be higher as data is less mature, but we believe that the opportunity for value creation is greater. And the risk, importantly, of operational disruption to the pipeline, internal pipeline, which is obviously maturing, we believe, very nicely, is going to be lower.","Certainly, in terms of what size we consider to be a bolt-on, generally, we don't comment specifically on size. I think you would say that assets that are in the range of a few billion dollars, we would consider to be bolt-on acquisitions, and that's really complements our pipeline. So we are very excited about the opportunities that we have and that's something that's particularly we're going to be focused on over the months ahead.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, John, and maybe I can provide some color to your question about Upjohn. It's a good question and I received a lot this question and I understand the reasons. Right now, as I said nothing is changed other than Upjohn performed very well in the first quarter. It's always said that our focus it is to make sure that we strength up this business in that way, that will operate affected and the fact remains that in the very new lean construct with the management relocated in China where most of the opportunities are as evident from the first quarter also where most of the challenges we're come as we know that there are some reforms that the Chinese government taking into this business. So right now, it's very, very pleased with the way that the whole thing has evolved. If we think that we could separate the down their hope, yes, it is a possibility, but this is not what it is, in my mind right now. First, we need to make sure, but we have a strong stand-alone business. So we are working to make sure that of the rates absorb as a subsidiary within a company.","Chuck Triano","Great, thank you, Albert, and John. Next question please, Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Mike and Albert, just wanted to see if you had any additional color on the recent add long-term data, just in particular the RPOA rates and I know you're awaiting FDA feedback. But would you view the totality of the data so far or the unmet need is still warranting filing at this point. And then another one on BD somewhat, so on the gene therapy front, you guys are obviously progressing a number of programs hemophilia DMD, but a lot of BD activity in this area. Recently, so the question has the decision to buy versus build, or partner change for Pfizer over time, it seemed like post the Bamboo deal you guys have a working platform that really could add multiple indications quickly I just wasn't sure what the, what the strategy is there. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Right. I will ask Mikael and John to comment on Tanezumab. So John, why don't you start and then maybe Mikael can give a little bit of scientific information?","John Young","Yes. So look, thanks for the question, Geoff. Obviously we've released fairly significant commentary on the study in our press release. I wouldn't comment on that, but I think, let me just say for Tanezumab we are continuing to analyze the clinical profile based on the ongoing Phase 3 development program in both OE and chronic lower back pain. That includes in totality five Phase 3 studies and nearly 7,000 patients and we plan to review the totality of the data with regulatory authorities and we'll assess potential next steps for Tanezumab and as we engage with regulators will be in a position to provide an update in the coming months.","Mikael Dolsten","It was very well-summarized John and of course it's a very large data sets from these recent Phase 3 and previous Phase 3. So it's a real opportunity to put together to tell it date together with our partner, Lilly, and have a discussion with regulatory agencies about that data set and paying landscape.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Mikael, and then maybe I can give you an answer to your question about gene therapy, it is yes, as you said gene therapy is an area but of significant focus for us in this scenario that we started much earlier and our strategy was to combine our clinical expertise and said they're therapeutic areas together with biotech expertise as they were developing specific projects and very early we realized that in this category the bottleneck is going to be manufactured. This is why Pfizer embarked into significant investments to build a platform in manufacturing, which is progressing very, very well.","As we look to the future, we plan to the box we grow our platform organically for projects that we're developing and indirectly through the licensing and partnership that we are going to make and actually the last partners, but we announced was in the gene therapy field for the Wilson disease, which is a lever disorder. We believe actually that exactly because of our track record of having successful partnerships, but also because we have built a significant manufacturing capability, we will become a partner of choice for Biotech that will see that the combination will unlock value for that.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thanks for those responses, we move on to the next question please. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Couple of questions please, firstly, you referenced these pending ACIP review for Prevnar 13, given the replacement there tight risks that we've seen because the pediatric vaccination. I know that your numbers and guidance includes those hedge their recommendation. What's your level of confidence and is high, which seems to be exactly why it is high given the meeting has been scheduled to discuss that. And then second, in reference to adequate. Could you talk to what you see is the likely impact on realized pricing and volumes for Eliquis sales within your Medicaid book of business assuming rebate reform takes place the administration that seems to be pushing for the beginning of 2020 many time.","Albert Bourla","All right, why don't you Angela answer the ACIP question?","Angela Hwang","So, our adult PCV13 vaccination program has been extremely effective and it's difficult for me to speculate on the ACIP vote because that's coming up in June. But I do want to emphasize that Pfizer strongly supports the continuation of the current adult vaccination program. This is because there are actually important serotypes such as serotypes 3 and serotypes 19A that still have not reached acceptable protection levels. So keeping the current recommendation will prevent numerous individual cases of pneumonia, hospitalizations and other outpatient treatments.","Direct vaccination is important because they are also underserved populations still in our country where the disease risk is high. And just to give you a couple of examples, those that are living in rural communities, have 50% less coverage than those that live in suburban areas or there is a 24 point gap among the low socioeconomic adults. I think you've also seen through the recent news reports the importance of direct vaccination for adults as well as for public health and we also looking forward to the filing of our next generation pneumococcal vaccine, where we received FDA breakthrough to exit designation. We expect to file this by the end of 2020 and so it underscores the importance of an interrupted adult vaccination program.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Andrew, you asked us about the Eliquis and how we think this will perform in the Medicare population particularly given price and volume. First of all, I would say that Eliquis had the phenomenal performance I think I'm seeking highly about the profile of this product. But 36% growth is really something that we feel - make us feel very proud and actually in the U.S., the growth was even stronger 38% but the U.S., it's part of the business, right. So it is a very, very well diversified geographically. And I think that the pricing pressures, the growth is coming predominantly those 38% from volume, and all our strategies it is how to make sure that the diagnosis rates are more accurate and people and physicians understand the profile of the products that they can make the right choices when they choose to prescribe a medicine like about. So given that everything is the predominant growth with this volume, I think very good about the growth prospects of this product going forward.","Chuck Triano","Thanks. Albert and Angela, can we move to our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on two broad topics. First on Ibrance adjuvant can you quantify for us how large an opportunity you think that is? And given the significance of it, I have to ask, is there an interim this summer. And secondly on DMD gene therapy, my question is, do you think you have a best-in-class asset and I ask partially because I don't see this asset listed in your 15 blockbusters, by 2022 which should theoretically be a very realistic possibility even if the pivotal where to start in early 2020, so just wanted to reconcile both of those. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Angela, I think you can deal with the Ibrance market potential and also let me, let me say that, on the studies, yes, there is an interim analysis, as with all studies, but the studies are designed to come to full completion. So we expect that the studies will be completed and we expect that this completion will happen next year although it is event-driven, so we'll need to see how events will evolve. But Angela, let's speak about the commercial opportunity, and then John, maybe you can give the clarification about DMD because what we have is 15 and 5, it was not the gene therapy molecule. Please.","Angela Hwang","So, we have the two Phase 3 studies ongoing in the high risk early breast cancer population, the first is the PENELOPE, which enroll patients with high risk early breast cancer previously treated with the neo-adjuvant therapy and then we have PALLAS which enrolled patients with the high risk early breast cancer stage 2 and 3, we're optimistic about both of these studies because of the ability to meet unmet need but also to your question more directly if successful we will have the ability from both of these programs to double the number of patients that are eligible for this.","John Young","Yes, and thanks for the question about DMD again, obviously the 15 and 5 or up to 15 and 5 portfolio reflected the portfolio that we had at that time and cleanly one of the sort of good things in our industry is the portfolio is never static and so I think as we begin to see data readout from our DMD gene therapy program, the profile of that medicine will become clear to us and to clinicians and to importantly to patients. So we would really see this having the potential to be an additional complement to that portfolio that we described last year. So I think it's obviously premature for anybody to disgrave the relative profile of respective or other comparative gene therapy assets, the data is still emerging, it's still and relatively small patient numbers and obviously for us and other players in this field, we will see the totality of data that emerges over the months and years ahead. But we feel cautiously optimistic about the program as I mentioned in my comments earlier on, we look forward to presenting some clinical data from that later on this year.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, John and Angela for the background. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Chuck Triano","I don't think we can hear you, if you are asking a question maybe you are in mute.","Louise Chen","Hold on, un-mute the phone. Can you hear me, okay now?","Chuck Triano","Very well.","Louise Chen","Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so thanks for taking my questions, I have a few here. So first question I had was on Tanezumab, just curious how the recent data impacting thinking with respect to the CLBP and cancer pain indications and then secondly on Tafamidis, how do you expect the initial launch to go if you do get approval this year, what is your anticipation for adoption, payer coverage, physician and patient awareness and then last question is on your business development comments, just curious if you have any interest in primary care or you more focused on specialized medicine? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. John, what about Tanezumab?","John Young","Yes, thanks for the question Louise. I mean I think we probably covered that mostly in our comments or later on. So we obviously issued fairly detailed press releases as each of our Phase 3 studies readout and I think what do I just say in overall is we're going to look at the totality of the data from all of our Phase 3 studies, we have round about 7000 patients worth of data, we're still on the process of analyzing the clinical profile and understanding its potential value across different indications.","Our next step is obviously most importantly going to be to discuss that data with regulators and we will be in a better position to be able to provide you with an update on this.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Angela, very exciting news for Tafamidis potential launch, so tell us\u2026","Angela Hwang","Yes, we are very excited about Tafamidis and that's because it's a transformative therapy for ATTR-CM and today it treats a fatal and a rare disease where there are no therapies and no alternatives but it also addresses a large burden on the healthcare system because of the complications and the hospitalizations that arise from this disease. We do see this so as a rare disease, so approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. But as you know today it is severely under diagnosed, we estimate approximately a less than 1% diagnosis rate because of the lack of treatment and the use of invasive heart biopsies to drive the diagnosis. So, as you can see diagnosis is going to be key to growing this market. At launch therefore we're going to be focused on creating suspicion of this disease by cardiologists and patients through educating them around the signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy.","We also need to increase the utilization of non-invasive methods such as scintigraphy and integrity versus a heart biopsy for diagnosis. So as you can see, this will all take time because we need to educate both physicians and patients on these red flag symptoms. We need to drive the utilization of scintigraphy and we also need to advocate for the changes in treatment guidelines which will help to drive both diagnosis and treatment. But as Pfizer, we are confident about our capability to build this market because we have a track record of success in creating new markets. And just to bring up an example from Xalkori, you may recall that at the time of launch of Xalkori the diagnosis rate of the ALK mutation was only 1%. But today it is 80% to 93%. So Tafamidis has excellent data, it has a compelling patient benefit. Pfizer has deep expertise and a commercial footprint in cardiology. So we look forward to bringing all of these capabilities to bear in launching this important medication to the patients who need it.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela and maybe I can make some comments about your question Louise about if we would be interested to all sort in license Primary Care potential candidates and medicines and the answer is of course yes. But let me be clear and specific what we mean. We have specific criteria what we are interested in licensing in, so it's not just the blind segment we have given to people go and license things. But those criteria involve the potential medicines it'll be breakthroughs. It's to be significant science that can create significant improvement in current standards of care. And they need to be within the areas of expertise of Pfizer, so that we can add value to it, just to go on without doing licensing.","But we can add value. And we have six areas of expertise right now that they are all from that aspect from my perspective, they are treated equally. Those are areas that we know we have the best science in the world that they can make fewer mistakes as we're selecting products. And this is where we have the scientific expertise to develop potential in licensing assets in the best possible way because the development path plays a key role in unlocking the value of a molecule and primary care is definitely one of the areas of significant expertise or funds from the long way that goes way back but also in the current days as we are having some of the best scientific programs running in evolving diseases and other primary care conditions in our research centers. So the answer is yes, and the criteria that we are going to implement I hope I made that clear.","Chuck Triano","Great, thank you, Albert. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Gerberry","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess it's firstly coming back to the Tafamidis launch. Can you give us a sense of what you view as maybe the best analogs for driving this diagnosis and treatment rate above this 1% level. I guess on the one hand it looks like there's a largely an educational element to this with a lot of these patients basically sitting in the cardiologist office just not diagnosed but you also have a drug that's pretty easy to dose no monitoring. So I'm just kind of curious, if there are any analogs that you guys have thought about. I wouldn't think that's Xalkori would be the greatest analog but correct me if I'm wrong. And then secondly on DMD gene therapy, it sounds like you haven't dosed any patients at the intermediate dose, I was curious sort of the rationale for having an intermediate dose, was that more of a safety consideration or just seeing the above normal expression levels achieved with separate program had a lower dose than your high dose was the decision ultimately to just have the optionality around a lower dose? Thanks.","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Angela, why don't you deal again with Tafamidis question. There is a lot of interest in this product and they understand why.","Angela Hwang","Yes, sure. So actually we do think that Xalkori is a great analog for what we see coming up for diagnosis in both Tafamidis and cardiomyopathy. You know, today this is a disease, where the symptoms, and the signs and symptoms are, easily, I guess it could be confused with heart failure. So I think the ability for us to be able to find diagnostic approaches that will help us to really identify and to isolate who, specifically the cardiomyopathy patients are going to be really important. I think that there are some symptomatic, some symptomatic attributes that we plan to be educating around at the time of launch.","But really, what we need is the ability to leverage technology such as integrity as an alternative to what exists today, which is a hard biopsy, which is extremely invasive. And I think that the ability to use scintigraphy will allow us to more readily diagnose these patients, I think the qualitative attributes some symptoms will allow us to create suspicion around what the right pool of patients might be. But the definitive diagnosis really needs to come with scintigraphy. There are 15,000 scintigraphy machines within cardiology offices today and 32 centers of excellence. So I think that this effort around education and awareness building is going to be key to both bring patients to the doctors' offices, but also to highlight the importance of these symptoms to prescribers and then to eventually diagnose and to treat. So as we said, I think we have deep expertise and capabilities in doing this, but that you can imagine with a disease that is so undiagnosed and up till now has had no therapeutic options. This is going to take time for us to really educate and to bring you know the full benefit of tafamidis to be bear.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela. And Mikael please, if you can comment on dosing strategy with a DMD development program, and maybe you can provide any color you would like about this breakthrough medicine?","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you very much. Yes, we worked with our bamboo colleagues and carefully designing these 89 vectors that contains muscle relevant to specific promote for expression of the transgene. And the protocol was designed intentionally based on our experience of many gene therapy programs to allow some flexibility, which was the basis for dosing at one into through 14 and swing into the 14 to gain experience, of course a reasonable dose range in what would be the expression of the transgene -- ability and clinical performance for young boys that as Albert alluded to earlier, we're aiming to a transformative outcome.","Now, we look forward to share data at the PPMD meeting in Orlando this late June. We think it is a good meeting for that purpose is one of the largest Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gathering where both key scientists attend and patient representative. As you know, these types of devastating rare disease, you work very closely with the leading scientist and patient groups. So, we look forward to be there and share data set as John alluded to earlier. ","Jason Gerberry","Thank you very much, Mike.","Albert Bourla","Right. Thank you for that background also. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning and thank you. A couple of follow-up questions on Tafamidis, congratulations on the approval in Japan; it was faster than we expected. We focus a lot on the U.S. market, but could you also comment on the ex U.S. opportunity families, and following up on the diagnosis rate commentary, my understanding was that you were also working on blood tests to make diagnosis even easier. Could you give us an update on those efforts as well as your potential launch readiness in case of earlier approval in the U.S.? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Alex. Angela again, you have the ex U.S. support through this and the testing?","Angela Hwang","Right. So, yes, with the Japan launch was very recent. And I think that the opportunity there sets us up well, for the kind of launches that we expect to see around the world, as you say, it's not just the U.S., it's Japan, it's also rest of world. In terms of rest of world, I think the findings have been submitted and unable to comment on those for now because we are still awaiting for commentary from the regulatory agencies, but I think that my general comment about Tafamidis is really one that I mentioned earlier, which is the critical aspect of this is diagnosis. It really is a rare disease. It is severely under diagnosed today because of the lack of options. And so, critical to our ability to drive Tafamidis growth anywhere in the world, is the ability for us to be able to find the patients and then be able to screen them and to be able to diagnose them and then send them on to treatment. So I see that these trends are pretty consistent wherever we are around the world.","Albert Bourla","Mikael is a great physician, but you are as well. Can you please comment a little bit on the diagnosis opportunities for this tafamidis?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, I want yes to punctuate that. The growing availability of scintigraphy technician based, makes it increasingly easy to get the diagnose off the suspicion often raised by clinical symptoms, and echocardiogram. We all seem parallel and looking at potential future blood markers. But right now, I think there should be no really hindrance to fast and easy diagnosis based on clinical sign scintigraphy. And in addition, we have made work on diagnostic algorithms, including artificial intelligence today which advise on typical algorithms that makes a hard cardiomyopathy, more likely to be TTR related, than unrelated.","Alex Arfaei","It's amazing how many -- how much work is happening right now in this field, and particularly how AI also can help identify potential people that potentially could suffer from this disease. And we had multiple discussions with payors well and a lot of them, they're having high interest to exploit this opportunity. Because when we say 1% is diagnosis, we don't mean that the 99% they just don't treat it. Usually all of these patients are presented with heart failure symptoms, and they are treated for the wrong reason. And they're going, of course, because the doctor haven't identified that this is the real cause of their cardiac issues, and then they treat it and fail and fail, and then eventually, there's a fatal event. So payers are highly interested diagnosis disease, I think, but as Angela said, this is the key. And we know how to do it very well. But it will take time to pick up these diagnosis rates, but we will do.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thanks for that context as well. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi, Navin Jacob, UBS. Thanks for taking the questions. A few, if I may a interesting slide on your treatments beyond up to 15 and 5, 2 in particular stood out the Oral GLP-1 and the HER2 ADC. Could you provide any context for how far along those assets are particularly the oral GLP-1, is it -- are those Phase 2 assets, Phase 1 assets, any color would be helpful. And then, I'll add to the questions on tafamidis. With regards to your pair discussions, are most of those related to traditional contracts or are you exploring outcomes based contracting? And if so, to what extent is that do you think outcomes-based contracting is will be a broad mandate or is it more of a experimental type of situation. And then finally, if you have any color on resolution of the sterile injectable manufacturing issues, is the resolution still expected for end of 2019? Thank you very much.","Chuck Triano","Thank you very much. Mikael, let's start with you, and with the Beyond 15 in 5?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, I really appreciate your interest in the Beyond 15 in 5, which of course covered in next period Beyond 22 of the up to 15 in 5. So for the oral GLP, that's been an area where we have deployed some unique chemistry. And I'm very pleased to say that we are right now concluding a Phase 1b trial in diabetic patients and I've seen some very encouraging performance of that drug related to control of diabetes and bodyweight and we look forward to share those and we'll swiftly move into a larger Phase 2 trial for diabetes.","To the best of our knowledge, this is the only true small molecule that have come this far and shown this promise in PK and pharmacodynamic favorable effects. The next generation or ADC is based on site directed conjugation of adjuvant inhibitor and has been going through dose escalation and showed promising signs of activity. We continue to optimize dose and expect to go into Phase 2 expansion cohort relatively soon including potential combination with P21 agents.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Michael. Let me give you a very brief comment on Tafamidis and then I will ask Frank to take the manufacturing question. On Tafamidis, as you know breakthroughs requires a breakthrough approach is also commercial and we believe that we want to, we believe that Tafamidis is also suitable product given that we have a strong clinical outcomes data for value based agreements. So we are discussing and with multiple base it's too early to comment because also we are in the middle of the year and usually contract starts from the beginning of the year. Nevertheless there is significant interest and discussions between ourselves and payers on agreements that will really value that the product brings to patients. So Frank, on manufacturing?","Frank D'Amelio","On the manufacturing, yes we do plan on having significant improvements implemented by the end of 2019. But please also know along the way we've already implemented numerous preventive and corrective actions and we've seen a nice improvement in our overall supply to-date.","Albert Bourla","Okay. And I want to say Frank is always a man of few words and a lot of factions. I'm very, very pleased with the way that under Frank's leadership and the new leadership business we are progressing on addressing the issues with manufacturing.","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Can we take next question please, Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the question. So just a couple of quick ones, can you just help us understand the number that you guys printed on EUCRISA this quarter as well as the sales for Xeljanz. What were the main impacts on both of those products? And then just a second question if you guys wouldn't mind again this is a bit related to Xeljanz. Can you help us understand how differentiated the products in the dermatology Phase 3 clinical trials whether it be in alopecia or in atopic dermatitis. How differentiated those are from Xeljanz and perhaps from some of the other programs in development? Thanks so much.","Albert Bourla","Right. Angela, why don't you hit quickly the decrease in Xeljanz's question and then you can leave time to Michael who is very passionate about the JAK portfolio to speak about it?","Angela Hwang","Okay, great. So let me start with some comments on Xeljanz. So as you can see Xeljanz had a 34% operational growth globally. In the U.S. Xeljanz grew 18% but actually the scripts grew 37%. So if you look at some of the Q1 effects some of that is due to higher rebating and favorable channel mix and reauthorizations for patients that change insurance. And this is pretty typical of what we see every quarter. So I think we're really encouraged by the strong volume growth that we've continued to see in the U.S. and around the world for Xeljanz and it's all three of our indications strong growth from RA, exciting new launches for both PSA and UC and we're beginning to see some very, very strong market shares for UC as well coming out of the gate.","For EUCRISA, specifically the number of EUCRISA patients in the U.S. for the first quarter was actually up more than 80,000 patients, so that's a 55% increase compared to where we were last year at this time. However, you do see revenues down slightly in Q1 and this is because despite the increased demand, we were negatively impacted by higher rebates in the U.S. So we need to continue to work on improving our formulary position and continuing to drive growth of EUCRISA in segments both in the U.S. as well as ex-U.S.","Albert Bourla","Michael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, so thank you for the interest in how we plan to grow the dermatology sector here. So for the atopic dermatitis well, we are in Phase 3 and with a JAK1 inhibitor and the first readout of the JADE trial program is coming now in May and the second is coming this fall. We selected JAK1, because JAK1 selective has the advantage that it covers certain cytokines that are part of the disease pathophysiology, aisle 4, aisle 13, similar as dupilumab, but on top of that, we cover aisle 31 that's related to the itch phenomenon that bothers atopic dermatitis patients. And we saw a very profound and early relief of that in phase 2 that we're obviously looking to confirm in our Phase 3 trials.","For alopecia, it's a different type of underlying mechanism where we deal with cytotoxic cells destroying the hair follicles and the X3 [ph] selective inhibitor is what we thought would be the best. And that was what we nicely recorded as a very effective agent in our Phase 2 trial. And it also has a very clean profile, the most well-tolerated agent we have seen so far. So we look forward certainly to the Phase 2b pivotal study, and we also started with [indiscernible] with this X3 inhibitor.","Chuck Triano","All right. Thank you very much, Michael. Our next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. So first I'm hoping that you can talk about your expectations for organic revenue growth prospects for your Upjohn division relative to the 1% that you printed in the first quarter. I just don't have a sense for how we should think about that, whether that will grow or since you put Lyrica in there, that it's about to decline. So if you could help us understand the growth prospects for Upjohn, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to your patents that could potentially be blocking Merck's 15-valent launch in coming years, could you please talk about those patents and your level of conviction that Merck cannot launch and then just a final tidbit what are your planned biosimilar launches in the U.S. in the second half of this year? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","So let me start with Upjohn and obviously Doug can cover the Merck patent situation and then Angela you can speak a little bit about the biosimilars. Our expectations for Upjohn in this year, of course, is going to be a decline, because they would be seriously affected by the loss of patent of Lyrica that will happen in the middle of the year. And that will affect their growth also next year, because they will have to face full-year LOE, which would be next year with only half a year LOE which is this year.","Following that, I see Upjohn as a very stable to low -- single-digit growth on the top line, and much higher on the bottom line, and leverage bottom-line growth, but of course, that will be post 2020 period where the impact of Lyrica will be absorbed. Doug?","Doug Lankler","So we were pleased that the patent trial and appeal board denied Merck's IPR petitions on two of our U.S. patents covering compositions of pneumococcal vaccines. These patents stand is valid and will not expire until 2026. We believe that these patents and others in our portfolio present freedom to operate issues for Merck in its development of a 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine.","Albert Bourla","Very clear.","Angela Hwang","And then biosimilars, so we will have three biosimilar launches in 2019. Trastuzumab was already launched in the EU in the first quarter and we look forward to the launch of tras in Japan in the third quarter. Rituximab will also be launched in Japan and that will be in the fourth quarter and then finally Bevacizumab will be launched in both the U.S. and Japan in the fourth quarter. We've seen some nice uptake in the supportive oncology portfolio that we launched late last year and we look forward to the oncology biosimilar portfolio contributing to our growth.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, and Operator, if we could take our last question, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Kathy Miner","Thank you. This is actually Kathy Miner on for Steve. Just a question on Bavencio please, we had been expecting Bavencio Phase 3 data in second line bladder this year, is this still possible. And secondly is there any chance for an interim on the JAVELIN Lung 100 this year and what is the PDL1 cut off for that trial? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Two questions Mikael for you.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So, thank you for showing interest in our Bavencio portfolio. So we expect late this year or possibly early next year as you know these store event driven trials that we will conclude the bladder, it's actually a first line trials so it's quite an interesting trial where we have Bavencio as maintenance therapy of the chemo, we'll also have PDL 1 high expression trial in line, which if positive could be the second PDX available for monotherapy and PDL 1 are in line and then we have a guest weak first line also post-chemo patients in maintenance for Bavencio, so, quite nice remaining cohort and we look forward to review the data coming out of this. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Mikael. And I think this concludes the Q&A session. But just I wanted to say, that I found this session very productive. I'm very pleased that the vast majority of the questions with the minus one or two, maybe we're focused on our pipeline and we're focused on [indiscernible] new launch products. And I don't remember any other sessions but frankly didn't receive any finance question, which is what happened today. I think this is exactly how science-based company when the results for the quarter are good, should be discussed in our earnings call. I'm very pleased about that. We continue to believe that Pfizer's position in the market is strong. We have great products, we have a strong R&D and marketing skills, prudent capital allocation and perhaps most important, a clear path towards sustainable growth. Thank you very much and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18410":["Pfizer Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2014 performance. I am joined today in by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Second Quarter 2014, which located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during the call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussion during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.","We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you Chuck and thank you all for joining our call this morning. I will begin with some brief comments from the quarter. Overall we saw good performance and strong operational growth in a number of areas including Lyrica in developed markets, Prevnar primarily in the U.S. and in emerging markets and Celebrex worldwide.","Our recently launched brands are making solid gains. Eliquis grew sequentially 50% quarter-on-quarter on a global basis while Xeljanz posted sequential growth quarter roughly 30% primarily in the U.S. With the continuation of this momentum these products are on a trajectory to become meaningful contributors to our underlying business in the coming quarters. We also are looking continued uptake with Xalkori and Inlyta globally.","Revenues in our consumer business increased 15% operationally primarily due to the recent launch of Nexium 24HR in the U.S. in late May. We also saw strong companywide performance within the emerging markets, revenue increased 11% operationally compared to the year ago quarter driven by growth in China, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.","Despite to somewhat slower start to the year, each of our businesses is performing well in the face of ongoing product losses of exclusivity for innovative businesses and continued pricing pressures and changing market dynamics effecting our established business.","I would also point out the negative impact of LOEs and the revenue loss resulting from the exploration of some co-promoted revenues was 1.7 billion for the first six months. This impact mass the companywide operational revenue growth from all other products during the first half of the year which was 3% overall.","In evaluating our performance now that we have been operating in our new commercial model since the beginning of the year, I believe this structure is providing greater transparency into the operations of each business and on a daily basis it enables decision making that better optimizes the performance and portfolio of each of our segments.","Furthermore we remain encouraged by key developments that demonstrate our pipeline momentum. Of particular note, we expect to complete the submission of the palbociclib new drug application to the FDA in August. This submission is based on the final result of PALOMA-1, a randomized, Phase 2 trial comparing the combination of palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone as the first line treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. We will publically communicate once we\u2019ve completed our submission. Also of note, our Phase III palbociclib trials in advanced breast cancer PALOMA-II and PALOMA-III are progressing and both trials have completed recruitment of new patients.","In addition, the number of Phase III studies where we are collaborating with leading international breast cancer investigators are open and enrolling patients with both advanced and early breast cancer and we have active exploration underway of multiple Phase I and II studies in non-breast indications.","Given the outbreaks of meningitis B disease on several US college campuses in 2013, we work closely with the FDA to submit our biologics license application for accelerated approval of our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal disease and in adolescent to young adults.","We look forward to the meeting that adjusted the scheduled to take place on August 13th by the CDC Advisory committee on immunization practices ACIP to discuss and vote on a potentially expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 use in adults.","We had a comprehensive Xeljanz program that is progressing with Phase III studies underway and you see in psoriatic arthritis and Phase II studies in psoriasis for top reviews, Crohn\u2019s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. We continue to enroll patients in Phase III trials of bococizumab for cholesterol lowering and high risk individuals, the total flows into the treatment of diabetes and later this year we expect to begin enrolling patients for the Rapunzel for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises individuals of sickle cell anemia.","As we ended the second half of this year, our strategy, focus and priorities remain unchanged, supported by the steady performance of each of our commercial segments. When it comes to business development, we will continue to evaluate all opportunities regardless of the size through the lens of value creation for our shareholders and enhancing the competitors of our businesses. ","Our most recent announced acquisitions and collaborations are example to enablers of our strategy. We expect far more meaningfully increase the size of our sterile injectable business through their existing and out licensed portfolios sterile injectables as well as the medium and long-term through the potential of their pipeline. And if we see promising result as we move forward with the selector\u2019s collaboration to develop immune therapies against select [indiscernible] oncology, we believe it has the potential for changing the way cancer is treated. ","In summary, for the remainder of this year, we will be focused on executing our plans and taking the actions that will further strengthen and globally position us as the market leader in each of our business segments. ","We remain committed to advancing innovative therapies on behalf of patients we serve, prudently managing deploying capital, to drive the greatest value for our shareholders and creating a culture within the organization where [indiscernible] creatively take prudent risk in operating with an entrepreneurial mindset.","I will now turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details of the quarter.","Frank D'Amelio","","Thanks Ian and good day everyone. As always the charts we are reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because of the focused position of Zoetis on June 23, 2013, the financial results of the animal health business and the gain associated with its fully disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the second quarter and first six months of 2013.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials.","Second quarter 2014 revenues of approximately 12.8 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange to an operational decline of approximately 1% driven mainly by the expiration on October the 31, 2013 of the co-promotion terms for Enbrel in U.S. and Canada, the ongoing terminations and expirations of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity is subsequent to multi-sourced generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and other product losses of exclusivity in various markets. ","These were partially offset by the strong operational growth in developed markets of Lyrica, Nexium 24HR in the U.S., Prevnar, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Celebrex, Xalkori and Inlyta and by strong operational growth of 11% in emerging markets. In addition reported revenues included 71 million transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis. ","I want to point out LOEs in declining alliance revenues had a negative impact of approximately $840 million, during the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 4% primarily due to fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to ongoing share repurchases and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer which were partially offset by a 4% aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D expenses resulting from an unfavorable shift in product mix and recently initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, palbociclib and the meningitis B vaccine and for the studies of Xeljanz and certain other products and potential new indications. ","However, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased because of continued benefits from cost reduction productivity initiatives. Reported diluted EPS of $0.45 compared with the $1.98 in the year ago quarter was primarily due to the non-recurrence in the second quarter 2014 of income from discontinued operations in the year ago quarter attributable to the animal health business including the gain associated with its disposition and the income in the year ago quarter from a litigation settlement for patent-infringement damages. And to a lesser extent the LOE from the exploration of the co-promotion term of certain products, all of which were partially offset by lower acquisition related cost, purchase accounting adjustments, and asset impairment charges.","A lower effective tax rate due to the resolution in the second quarter of 2014 of certain prior year tax positions with various foreign tax authorities, a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the non-recurrence of the unfavorable impact of the tax rate associated with the aforementioned patent litigation settlement income and finally fewer shares outstanding.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by 1% or 87 million that had a net positive impact of 18 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. Consequently, foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared with a year ago quarter.","Now moving onto the financial highlights of our businesses, in second quarter Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year due to the previously mentioned exploration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in Canada in February of 2013. And the exploration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel and LOEs of certain products resulted in an operational decline of $459 million; however, all other GEP revenues grew 9% operationally driven by strong growth from Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and Japan as well as the performance of recently launched products including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S.","Income before taxes declined 12% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase in cost of sales or a 1.2 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues. I want to point out here that the loss of Enbrel alliance revenues in the second quarter 2014 negatively impacted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues by 1.5 percentage points operationally, 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses from an increased investment in new products and in line brands such as Lyrica and Viagra as well as a 41% operational increase in R&D expenses due to recently initiated Phase 3 programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, and additional Xeljanz indications.","In the second quarter, revenues from our vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare business grew 15% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth of Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and emerging markets, the launch of Nexium 24HR in the U.S. in late May 2014 and the continued strong uptake of Xalkori and Inlyta globally. Income before taxes increased 10% operationally due to increased revenues, which were partially offset by a 23% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes in unfavorable change in product mix, an 18% operational increase in SI&A expenses associated with the launch of Nexium 24HR and the prelaunch marketing expenses to the meningitis B vaccine palbociclib. And the 16% increase in R&D expenses supporting the acceleration of the meningitis B vaccine at palbociclib development programs.","The second quarter Global Established Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year due to the loss of exclusivity and subsequent launch of multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. January 2014, Viagra in most European markets in June of 2013, and Aricept in Canada in December of 2013 as well as the ongoing termination of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva in most countries including the U.S. in April and the ongoing exploration in certain other countries. These were partially offset by the strong operational performance of Celebrex in most major markets, Lyrica in Europe and Lipitor primarily in China.","The LOEs of certain products, the loss of alliance revenue for Aricept and Spiriva and Lipitor in developed markets negatively impacted GEP revenues by 395 million operationally; however, all other GEP revenues grew 1% operationally. Income before taxes declined 4% operationally due to the decrease in revenues was partially offset by the aggregate decrease, cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses which included increased spending on biosimilar development programs.","Now moving onto our 2014 financial guidance, we've updated several components of our adjusted guidance and reaffirmed our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Because of the anticipated negative impact from the expected multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December 2014 we now expect revenues to be in the range of 48.7 billion to 50.7 billion versus 49.2 billion to 51.2 billion. This range absorbs the negative impact of approximately 3.4 billion due to declining alliance revenues and expected product losses of exclusivity. In addition, we are decreasing our adjusted SI&A expense range due to an expected reduction in promotional spending for Celebrex in second half of 2014 and now expect adjusted SI&A to be in the range of 13.3 billion to 14.3 billion compared with 13.5 billion to 14.5 billion previously.","To reflect the planned 80 million upfront payment to Cellectis for our global strategic collaboration and anticipated increased expenses for the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical programs including palbociclib and bococizumab among others, we now expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 6.7 to 7.2 billion versus 6.4 to 6.9 billion previously. We now expect approximately 200 million of other income versus approximately 100 million of other deducts because of lower expecting net interest expense for the remainder of 2014 and gains realized during the first half of 2014 mainly on sales of product rights and investments in equity securities.","We expected reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.47 to a $1.62 due to charges related to certain legal matters primarily related to Neurontin incurred during the first quarter 2014. And we are reaffirming our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 which absorbs approximately $0.05 per share for anticipated negative impact related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to the planned upfront payment to the Cellectis collaboration.","Now moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid second quarter 2014 results. We reaffirmed our adjusted diluted EPS range which absorbs an approximately $0.05 anticipated negative impact related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to Cellectis. We achieved several key R&D milestones including the initiation for rolling submission in June 2014 of an NDA seeking approval for palbociclib which is expected to complete this August.","In June we submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine candidate and we discussed with the ACIP at its June meeting a potential expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 used with adults. We expect the ACIP\u2019s decision on August 13. We announced several business development opportunities to further strengthen our position in key strategic areas and we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.","To date 2014, we repurchased 2.9 billion or approximately 95.1 million shares and we continue to expect to repurchase 5 billion of our common stock this year. These repurchases and planned repurchases for the remainder of the year are expected to reduce total shares outstanding year-over-year by a total of approximately 100 million shares by the end of 2014 after considering actual and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs.","Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond. Now, I will turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Frank. Operator, at this point can we call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan ","","Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. The first one on assumptions is the first time you've been at this recently but on business development, just how are you thinking about DDA at this point. I guess given the valuation research and pipeline recovery that\u2019s occurred within this space, is it more challenging to find larger deals that both advance the Pfizer story and give your investors (indiscernible) they are looking for? ","And the second question for the past year or so until the Astra approach that better focus on potential breakup of Pfizer based on your new corporate structure you are creating coupled with your pipeline recovery, can you update us on your thoughts on that potential split of Pfizer over time, has your view of breakup making potential sense making at all? And I guess do you still see merits in the idea of splitting the company over time? Thanks very much.","Ian Read"," ","Thank you for questions Chris. On BD, BD is not a strategy, it's an enabler strategy. We continue to aggressively look at all cuts of BD regardless of size that we believe would add value to shareholders. So, that our stance on BD and on this much discussed potential breakup as before, we are managing the business in two segments broadly speaking. One being innovative and the other being established. And in the innovative we have sub businesses like oncology and a consumer and vaccines that are very distinct from other parts of the innovative business.","So, we are giving you transparency on those segments and we are collecting both P&L and balance sheet information to give us optionality. What we do eventually will really depend upon how those business perform, how our shareholders value those businesses and we will look at that after an appropriate period of time of both collecting the data we need for optionality and the performance in the marketplace. Thank you.","Frank D'Amelio"," ","The only thing I would add Chris to punctuate what Ian said is and I think for the time being and for the near future the most important thing those businesses can do is execute with excellence so that operational performance and that will create all kinds of options and choices for us in the future.","Ian Read"," ","And fundamentally I see BD is adding to what I see as a strong hand we have with our core strategies.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse ","","Thanks for taking the question. Couple here. Again, I'm sure you've gotten some of these before as well. But one around the increased rhetoric in Washington around inversions. Would that impact, or is it impacting any way the way you look at doing an inversion-based deal in the future? And then the second one, just on the pipeline around Palbo, I think there's still a lot of questions. You said obviously you're going to file next month, a lot of questions around with what the FDA is going to do and really, why would the FDA approve it on an expedited basis when you'll be getting full Phase III data just a few months later? And so if you can give us any updates there around discussions you've had with the FDA and why the need to, again, just maybe take a little bit more of a risk to get this out just a few months ahead of the full data session. Thanks.","Ian Read"," ","In Washington, we remain committed to discussing and advocating for fundamental tax report. And that will play out with the political parties we suspect over the next coming years. And it\u2019s really difficult to comment more than that other than we do believe the tax system is inherently puts the companies at a disadvantage and we would like to see the tax system reformed.","On palbo, I think there is some confusion as to when we get the final Phase III data, but I will ask to Albert to comment on the palbo submission.","Albert Bourla","","As you are aware, our submission is based on the final results for our Phase II trial and this has happened after conversations with FDA. I don\u2019t want to speculate what FDA will request as we go through the review process but I can tell you that until now, they have not placed any conditions on us related to the Phase III trial results. As we learn a little bit the Phase III has completed recruitment and it is expected to come to final completion at the end in December of 2015 and the final report would be available in 2016.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein ","Just going back to M&A and I know you all probably struggle to answer this question, but in your prepared remarks, you said you would continue to evaluate all opportunities regardless of size. My question is whether it\u2019s reasonable to expect that Pfizer could find strategically attractive targets that are big enough such as tax conversion could be one of the benefits, so the operative here for me would be strategically attractive. Because I can think of other theoretical inversion targets but I am not sure I see the strategic value on those, I\u2019d like to get your opinion on that. And then on palbociclib in Europe, do you expect that PALOMA-1 will be adequate first submission or will regulatory authorities likely require at least interim Phase III results before proving kind of like a date with Xalkori?","Ian Read","Why don\u2019t you take the palbo question and I will come back to the M&A?","Albert Bourla","","Look I mean as you can expect we have begun discussions with the European and other regulatory health authorities and those discussions are for palbociclib and those discussions include discussions on the clinical data. Also we have presented to them our development program and we have entered into discussions about the potential regulatory path forward. But it is too early to disclose at this stage, our regulatory strategy for these reasons.","Ian Read","","Thank you. And Tim on M&A, we look and continue to look at a very wide spectrum of M&A transaction, so we have substantial financial ability and balance sheet and tax inversion is one part of the value equation. I mean we're looking at AZ, we\u2019ve looked at both their pipeline the synergies and the tax inversion. So we will continue to look very broadly at deploying our capital in a way that makes sense for shareholder return.","Operator","Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs ","","I know we are all kind of dancing around the same issue Ian but just on the assumption that AstraZeneca does not materialize, is there actually a plan B in place? What we have seen since then is a small acquisition InnoPharma and is that the kind of deals that we should anticipate going forward or is there still a plan in place to achieve a lower tax rate to enhance the pipeline?","And then I don\u2019t know if Mikael Dolsten is on the call, but just a question on business development in out licensing activity. I mean we have seen recently a couple of high profile licensing deals, tremelimumab to AstraZeneca and neratinib to Puma and regrettably those look like a very unfortunate decisions and just Ian, are you working internally and are you pleased with the team that you have in place who are charged with making these critical decisions? Thanks very much.","Ian Read","","So on the BD, we looked at both those assets that you mentioned early on in their lifecycle and we looked at the opportunities with inside our portfolio and took decision given that they were lower -- we believe lower value assets to what we knew about those assets at the time to out license them. ","In the case of the Puma asset they acquired neratinib, we outlicensed this so what we looked at almost 10 companies and most of them major pharmaceutical companies. And the only company that was interested in this development was Puma. And as such, we were pleased with the outlicensing we struck with them and the royalty rate. I have not seen the data, nor has Pfizer seen the data that may or may not indicate that the product has value and we will be in discussions with Puma vis-\u00e0-vis our legal rights as to that data and the consequences of that data. ","On the tremelimumab, it was a decision to outlicense to AZ and I am not aware of any data that would make me believe that we made a mistake given the fact we had other products that we were developing of higher productivity value.","Now with regard to plan B, my comment would be our plan A is a plan to continue to develop our innovative pipeline to restore the vigor in our pipeline. We're making progress with mid-and late-stage pipelines including Prevnar adult, palbociclib, bococizumab, ertugliflozin mening B and Xeljanz follow indications. We're continuing to grow on newly launched brands such as Eliquis, Xeljanz, Inlyta, Lyrica and Embrel. And we\u2019re focusing on the emerging markets, so plan A is to continue with the strategy we\u2019ve always articulated which is to re-vigor our innovative core, make our R&D productive, and make smart and shareholder friendly capital allocation decisions. Any BD that we do will be looked at for the view of accelerating those strategies and improving returns to shareholders and the deal that you are in a pharma and Cellectis are deals that are opportunistic and add on and we can build and help the underlying BUs, but certainly are not representative of the total firepower of corporate strategy of Pfizer. Frank do you want anything to that?","","Operator","Your next question come is from the John Boris from SunTrust Robinson.","John Boris - SunTrust Robinson","First question for Frank, in 2013 and for the front half 2014, you returned a significant amount of cash through share repurchases and through dividends in both of those years, can you just remind us what the total amount that you returned and how much cash that you have to bring back offshore to be able to fund your share repurchase and your dividend from offshore? ","Second question for Ian on large scale versus tuck-in type acquisitions, if you look at your U.S. operation which is traditionally the most profitable operation as a major pharma, it seems with ongoing losses of exclusivity and losses of alliance revenue that that operation seems to be under a fair amount of pressure, you do have some pipeline assets that you\u2019re successfully launching through there, but is the scale of what you\u2019re launching large enough to be able to offset some of those pressures that you have from continued losses of exclusivity losses of alliance revenue? ","And then on your established products business traditionally you\u2019ve had a lot of success bringing in injectable assets into that business but on a global basis is it of scale where you have the regulatory capabilities needed to be able to successfully launch other types of assets on a global basis through that strategically? Thanks.","Ian Read","Thank you, John. Frank, do you want to take the first question?","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So John just in terms of running the numbers, last year we returned 23 billion to our shareholders between share buybacks and dividends. The buyback piece of that was 16.3 billion. This year the buyback piece year-to-date is 2.9 billion. If you look our dividend on an annual basis, we got on average call it 6.4 billion, 6.5 billion shares at above full dividend, and call that 6.5 billion to 7 billion so from midyear piece of that to another 3 billion, 3.5 billion. And then if you look by the way just in terms of numbers, if you look over the last three years \u201911, \u201912, and \u201913, we returned about 53 billion to our shareholders in terms of buybacks and dividends. In terms of major way we have funded that as then through some our unlocking value activities. So we sell Capsugel the cellular nutrition and we exchange for Zoetis. So those are three of the ways we have done that and obviously through very effective and efficient tax plan.","Ian Read","Thank you, Frank. On your question about scale of the innovative business, obviously your question goes to the strategic issue we\u2019ve been dealing with as we\u2019re trying take care of the LOEs while trying to minimize revenue decreases while growing our EPS, and I think we've been doing a good job of doing that while we manage the sort of onslaught of LOEs with EPS growth. ","So, it comes down to with the question of the growth of Lyrica, the growth of Eliquis, the growth of Xeljanz, the adult vaccine, the mening B, the Xeljanz follow ons. What is the extent of growth we can get from that while we continue and of course palbociclib and when it launches that compared to the LOEs plus the growth we can get out of them as you market, so it\u2019s a very good question. We feel that our strategy is the right one. We will continue to be challenged on revenue growth that we see that we can manage through this cycle through those products I just mentioned and behind that we see a wave of very exciting products coming as we get through the LOEs. On EP I would ask John to comment.","John Young","Okay so thanks for the question, John its sterile injectable. And I think maybe the first point to make is that we actually have a very strong sterile injectable business globally not only in the U.S. But one of the features of the market overall is actually is pretty concentrated and thereabout five markets globally that probably represent about 80% of the total profit pool and sterile injectable. The US is obviously one of those markets but the other markets would include China, Japan, France and Italy. It was actually more concentrated that you would think and I think the answer to your question as we actually feel very confident about the underlying capabilities that we have particularly in regulatory affairs could be able to bring to market products in that portfolio either products that we're developing organically or hopefully in the future pending completion of the acquisition of InnoPharma products that would come out of the pipeline outside of that company.","Ian Read"," ","I would add John, our established products, our international presence is probably the strongest of the American company and certainly on the power of any of the Europeans, they had great strength broadly speaking in emerging markets with a number one multinational in China. I\u2019m very confident we have the talent, the distribution and the know how to fully leverage our products globally. Thank you for the question.","Operator","","Your next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley ","","Yes, thanks very much. I have two strategic questions and then one cost question. So, on the first two, number one I was just wondering if you could provide feedback that you received on the final offer of 55 for AstraZeneca that you received from major investors? ","And second, are you considering other major tax redomiciling transactions and then with respect to net cost obviously Pfizer continues to cut costs but also needs to reinvest. So, beyond 2014 Frank, should we think about Pfizer being able to reduce net cost in terms of selling and general administrative and R&D or at the end of this year will you be at the point of essentially looking at flattish cost or rising cost going forward? Thank you.","Ian Read"," ","So, now you see, you understand I can\u2019t make any forward looking statements on AZ, I would like to put in context of I believe inflations already been reported. We were faced with the AZ management with an indication that they would not engage with us in a meaningful way unless we had an opening of approximately 59 pound. Faced with that, we made report was a full and final offer of 55 pound that fully valued the company and gave appropriate sharing of synergies to the appropriate shareholders. We have in general received good feedback from our shareholders that we demonstrated appropriate capital discipline.","Are we looking at additional or other BD deals? Absolutely. And would the tax inversions because that value, this was with AZ, it will be part of the value that we look at, but we also look for a strengthening parts of our businesses as well as we do that fundamentally what we look for is will any BD create long term value for our shareholders and that\u2019s the lens we look at it through not necessarily through financial strategic but overall is it value creating against our cost of capital. Frank, on a cost -- ?","Frank D'Amelio ","","And so David, just in terms of timing, when we close out the year we are on the end of January or at least February call it 15, we'll close out Q4 and then I will give specific guidance by line item for 2015, so you will get the specific numbers then, but I will comment, I'll answer your question now and maybe macro-context, what I have said this year, last few quarters is I think we\u2019ve entered delayed innings on cost reduction. We have got some pressure on R&D is that we have initiated some late stage and development programs that we have eluded on the call, we've had some pressure on SI&A and due to launch cost cutting products is a good problem to have. That said in terms of managing our cost and expense structure, our expectation is that we will continuously improve as we go forward and there are still opportunities to improve our cost structure and we'll capitalize on those opportunities and we will drop as much of that to the bottom line as we can and that will be a balance between cost benefit analysis and how we deploy our capital.","Operator","","Your next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America","","Thanks. A few product questions, if I may. On Xeljans, can you just give us a little more color on the performance in the quarter? And then looking forward, where are you in terms of getting the 10-milligram dose approved in RA. Given you intend to follow the 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses in psoriasis, what gives you confidence the FDA will feel comfortable with a 10-milligram dose in this setting? And then on the once-daily formulation, what are the timelines associated with this? ","And then finally on ertugliflozin, how do you see yourself competing, given it looks like you'll be fourth to market and historically, third or fourth entrants in these types of commoditized markets have struggled to gain meaningful share? Thanks.","","Geno Germano","","Sure. So, let me start out with Xeljanz so we had a good with Xeljanz. We grew by over 30% from the first quarter this year. We think we have really hit an inflexion point with the launch of the structure data that they came after in the first quarter this year. So, we have some momentum and we\u2019re feeling good about the performance in the U.S. ","With regard to the 10 milligram in RA, we think that that\u2019s going to be -- that\u2019s going to take a while, that\u2019s going to take accumulation of additional safety data to satisfy the FDA. Although we have 10 milligram registrations in other countries, so we will just see how that plays out.","With regard to psoriasis, we have a fairly large comprehensive data base over 3,600 patients and four significant trials in psoriasis. The results that we saw across the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses were consistent in those trials. It is obviously a different a patient population with a different safety and efficacy profile overall. So we are in the process now of assembling our dossier and we will file a dossier and have discussions with the agency on the appropriate benefit risk and the appropriate dosages for that indication.","With regard to the once a day, we are continuing to make really make really good progress with the once a day program. As you may know, we are not needing to do any addition clinical work, we are doing some pharmacology and PK work. So we expect to be filing in the first half of 2015. And with regard to ertugliflozin, we have, again a comprehensive program and partnership with Merck developing ertugliflozin as a single entity molecule or product and also in combination with JANUVIA and metformin and we will have an overall strategy that involves both the single entity and combination products to make our way into that marketplace. ","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno. Of course I should say fourth in, but it depends upon the quality of the clinical trial and the results we get and we believe that it is potentially best in class molecule.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS ","Geno, I was wondering if you could also give us an update on Xalkori and Inlyta, how those products are doing in the trends and how much more you think we can get from those. Second question is an update on tanezumab and third, China, maybe you could talk about some of the trends in China. Are we still gaining market share over there? Are we adding sales reps, are we moving into new cities and how the Hisun JV has worked out. Thanks. ","Geno Germano","So Albert in fact will -- has oncology and his responsibility, he will answer the Xalkori, Inlyta questions and then we will go to Mikael for tanezumab. And then perhaps in general, perhaps John could answer the China question.","Albert Bourla ","","Mark, Inlyta overall very pleased with the performance with Inlyta, that was driven by very strong up take in key new regions. In the quarter we had 101 million of sales that was up 44% operationally from last year. Very seamless sentiments for Xalkori, we reported revenues of 108 million for the quarter that was up 59%. Overall, the growth is driven as a result of we have increased testing for the [indiscernible]. It is 78% remind you that when we launched the product it was 11%, so quite a strong uptake. ","And second reason is because we\u2019ve extended duration of [indiscernible] so more patients are treated and they are treated for long. So very strong performance for both, we expect to see this growth continue.","Mikael Dolsten","","Yes, so on tanezumab and thank you for the interest in that asset and as you may remember tanezumab delivered some very strong efficacy signal in the previous studies and represent potentially one of the few classes of new mechanics that are recently proving substantial clinical benefit. And we have been working with FDA in some very good constructive dialogues and what needs to be demonstrated in pre-clinical toxicology in order to submit a new package that could open up at a potential for reinitiating those studies. This has been focused on pre-clinical studies on the peripheral nervous system. And we have done some in depth studies that continue to accumulate data but so far I am encouraged about we have learned about the drug and the mechanics and we have stated that we will plan potentially to resubmit the data if we'll continue to come together in a positive way no later than first part of 2015.","Frank D'Amelio","So thanks for the question Marc. So I mean I think we are obviously very pleased with the performance of China this quarter. Overall, the total biopharmaceutical business in China showed operational growth of 27%. The GEP business was in line at 37% in the quarter. And you can see the product performances when you get to the schedules and the earnings release. So pretty much across the Board what we have seen is strong volume growth driven by good operational performance in the marketplace. I think maybe just a comment on overall strategy in China for a business which clearly is very important to us. Overall, our strategy has a number of areas of focus. We are very focused on driving the legacy brands in China, LIPITOR is probably a standout product for us and we see a great fit with the priorities of the Chinese government to really better treat and manage patients with cardiovascular disease on a portfolio of Lipitor and Norvasc is a great fit in that regard. ","You mentioned Hisun and certainly we\u2019ve had a strategy in China for a number of years and I had to really find ways of participating in the profitable segments of the fast growing generic markets. And our partnership with Hisun is really a great example of that. Overall generic products came for around 70% of the domestic market in China and really our partnership with Hisun places this extremely well to be able to maximize our contribution there with products that are great fit with again the means of the healthcare system.","Third clearly we\u2019re looking to bring innovative products to market and the GIP and [warts] businesses in China are looking to maximize the performance of innovative products in the market as well as bring new products to market. And overarching all of that, the last thing I would just say is that we\u2019re clearly looking to find ways of collaborating very constructively with the Chinese government and with their goals for the development of the pharmaceutical industry capability in China. We\u2019ve had domestic manufacturing capacity in China for many years and we are also very engaged with working with the Ministry of Health to partner with them to better screen patients for cardiovascular disease in China as well. So all of those things together really can be hopefully a flavor of what is driving the performance in China this quarter.","Ian Read"," ","And then Mark I\u2019ll just run a few of the numbers and then I\u2019ll answer your question about REPS. So John mentioned 27% operational growth for the biopharmaceutical business. Total company for the quarter grew 24% operationally and then John mentioned Lipitor and Norvasc, Lipitor in China grew 55% operationally quarter-over-quarter, Norvasc grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. So just some really-really strong performance. And we have added a significant amount of REPS in China in the first half of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink","Thanks very much. I have three questions. The first one on palbociclib, can you update us on the potential interim look in Paloma 2? ","The second question is really for Frank. Frank, maybe you can confirm for us, as we look at the year-over-year comparisons, we do see the 2013 numbers broken out. But can you just confirm that this is not fully audited information that would include the balance sheet? Basically, my question is, is historically you've said that there won't be a look back at 2013 that would basically facilitate a split occurring sooner. But as I look at that data, if it were fully audited, it would seem like that might be a possibility. ","And then my last question for Ian, would you ever consider a sale of the innovative businesses, should you be approached by another company\/ basically a willingness, if it made sense for shareholders in terms of that value, that might be provided to Pfizer in an eventual split? Thanks so much. ","Ian Read"," ","Yes there is an interim review built into the design of Phase 3 trial of PALOMA-2 but you know the timing of that review is event driven, so we cannot speculate when that review will exactly take place. As I said before, the primary completion of the study is expected to be end of \u201915, so the final report is expected in \u201916. Again, it\u2019s event driven so the actual data may vary a bit.","Frank D'Amelio","So Seamus, the way I think about this is no change from I have said previously which is if it\u2019s a public transaction, if we were to decide to do something from a separation perspective in the future, it would be three years of audited financials. In that with year-one being 2014, so it would be prospectively there years of audited financials. So no change from what I have said previously.","Geno Germano","So on your last question, Seamus, I see myself in the management team and I am sure the Board sees themselves as custodians of shareholder value and so we would have to evaluate any proposal under its merit and we believe it produces long-term superior returns of shareholders.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got three for you. First off on Prevnar 13, would you just like to frame the opportunity for us again, if you were to receive a positive recommendation from the ACIP in August, and is that contained within your guidance for this year? ","Secondly, could you just comment around your strategic thoughts on your consumer business? Given some of the recent consolidations in that industry, does this asset still make most sense within the Pfizer structure? ","And then lastly, I wonder if you could just an up to date overview of your biosimilar programs and the potential timelines for any key assets. Thank you."," ","Ian Read"," ","Okay on the consumer business, we see the great store value. We have an active -- we\u2019ve acquired assets in that business. We\u2019ve just launched Nexium 24HR. We have an active RX OTC suite strategy, so we see it as a business that we want to be in. On Prevnar 13 adult, I'll ask Albert to give you some idea of the opportunity. The early approval is included in this year's overall guidance, no major change.","Albert Bourla "," ","Yes I will -- this is a great opportunity of course globally not only in U.S. because there is a very large adult target population and there is a significant unmet need over the 300 million adults are greater than 65 years of age in the world and half of that it is in U.S. and Japan. 3.6 to 3.7 million U.S. adults are turning 65 this year and also depending upon a ACIP recommendation. We do believe that there could be even an additional catch up opportunity for adults greater than 65 that have already received the old generation vaccine.","So, we expect the Prevnar 13 to be the leading adult vaccination given the strength of our data.","John Young"," ","Okay, thanks again for the question Jeff. So, essentially we have five monoclonals in development, all of those products we expect to come to market in the 2017-2018 timeframe after the loss of exclusivity of the basic patterns of those molecules. So just to give you a rundown of the five, we have trastuzumab which is a biosimilar for Herceptin. That is already in Phase III, that Phase III was initiated earlier on this year. We have a biosimilar rituxumab that achieved our proof of concept in the first half of this year and we expect to initiate Phase III in the second half of 2014.","We have biosimilar infliximab Phase I that was completed or we expect to complete at the end of this year and the next milestone there would again be initiation of Phase III and the second half of this year we have biosimilar adalimumab Phase I has been initiated and the next milestone would be a proof-of-concept redirect from those Phase I studies and making this year and then we have biosimilar bevacizumab that is in preclinical and the next milestone for that program would be the initiation of Phase I studies again this year.","Operator","","Your next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets ","","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. On palbo, when can we expect updated survival data from Paloma 1? And a higher level R&D question, is there an opportunity for additional cost savings in your R&D structure? We've seen some of your peers simplify their structure and achieve significant savings without seemingly compromising productivity. Is that option for Pfizer? Thank you. ","Albert Bourla ","","Yes, on the overall survival data, we had initial assessment but it was done when we had only 37% of the total events. Now, there is a follow up analysis that is scheduled following the accrual of additional events but the time can take really long because the average, the medium overall survival of this population it is unfortunately four years. So, I really think that the final analysis likely will take long. Just a reminder though here that the primary end point of their study was the progress on free survival the overall survival was one of the secondary end point and also historically agents on the market for [indiscernible] metastatic breast cancer have been approved all with PFE\u2019s data as a primary end point.","Ian Read"," ","Thank you, Albert. So on R&D question, we feel that post the acquisition of Wyeth we were very prudent in the way we dimensioned our R&D spend, I believe taking the combined spend of sum 11 million down to 6.5, 6.7. So, I really can\u2019t comment on what our competitors have been doing but certainly for a few years now we have accelerated the refining of how much we spend in research, where we spend it, we have really good tools internally to look at the productivity by asset and we invest behind strong signals with lots of quality gates and we had separated out the decision between proof-of-concept and a decision to move forward into Phase III between the research and the commercial business, so we've got strong internal drivers for a return on a capital. ","Will we continue to look at the best ways to invest in research? Of course we have got a CTi initiative where we have major relationships with some 20 universities in the U.S. and I believe outside of the U.S. at least one where we attempt to look to be efficient the way we discover mechanisms of action and of course this is a major expense which we are constantly monitoring to make sure its efficient. ","When you have great products like we do and we are bringing them forward in the development and Phase III clearly there is pressure on the development cost of large trial such as within bococizumab or with palbociclib or with the mening B or with the staph aureus vaccine. So, clearly there are pressures on our Phase III spend that we will continue to manage our overall R&D spend within our overall guidance and overall drive to continue to grow EPS.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi","Hi. Couple of questions, please. First, we've obviously seen increased pressure by PBMs together with lesser price disciplines from the pharma industry translating into negative pricing dynamics in respiratory and diabetes spaces. I would be interested in your view on the evolution of that into the specialty pharma segment. And then leading on from it, and I appreciate it's a different situation, but GSK recently announced the pricing for their GLP 1 at a 65% discount for the first in class. To what extent do you think aggressive pricing strategies like that may work for products where it is late to market? And I guess I'm thinking partly of Xeljanz. Maybe not now, but at one point does a pricing lever become a potential option for you? ","And then secondly, building an oncology company around one drug is not easy, particularly if you've never had a strong legacy oncology business, as I think is the case with Pfizer. To what extent do you think you can build an oncology company without the acquisition of external talents and additional products through an M&A structure? Thank you. ","Ian Read"," ","Well undoubtedly the PBMs are doing what they constructed to do, is to try and aggregate volume and achieve price discounts. This has been going on in the U.S. markets for many years now and I think will continue to occur. It really depends on the value that you bring to the market place. And we are focused on that and I think specialty products, certainly normally if you define them as having close to cures or having dramatic impact on the outcome of disease or with disease modifying have huge value. And so I believe we will continue to see an attention in there but value is rewarded, innovation is rewarded. I really can\u2019t comment on GSK pricing and on how we price Xeljanz? We think it reflects the both the composition of the value to the patient of value in the marketplace. And the most important thing in that market is I think is the efficacy and safety and adoption is normally slow and driven by clinical data rather than pure pricing decision. So I would see pricing as being more for acute conditions or conditions with highly genericized and it\u2019s not so much a sort of long term serious disease. ","Geno, do you want to comment anything more on that?","Geno Germano","All that I would say is that as I am sure you are aware Andrew the pricing reimbursement process is particularly in the United States is very complex, very fragmented and we are dealing with not only prices but discounting, rebating, step edits, tiering of formulary status. And so it\u2019s not as simple as saying the price should be higher or lower, it\u2019s really a strategic approach to the marketplace where you first and foremost have to build value for your product and then operate within the system that exists out there for maximum benefit. So it\u2019s a day in and day out process, we think very strategically about how to price our products, how to discount our products, how to position our products on formularies. And I think we are going to continue to need to do that.","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno. On Oncology, I don\u2019t quite understand your comment about building around one product. We have Xalkori in the market, we have Inlyta in the market, Bosulif in the marketplace, we have Sutent in the marketplace. So we see palbo as another product coming to market and we have a very in depth Phase II oncology portfolio. So perhaps Mikael, do you want to just mention a little bit about how you see the oncology portfolio developing?","Mikael Dolsten","Thank you, Ian. So one hand there is significant activities on expanding palbociclib into a variety of additional indications and we have a handful of Phase I, Phase II studies exploring various segments of lung cancer including genomic defined with collaborators melanoma and we are also looking into other novel indications. We have a very exciting smoothened EBITDA that we\u2019re broadly expanding into a variety of blood cancer in ongoing Phase II studies, including AML and mild myelodysplastic disease. Our gamma secretase inhibitor shows a very interesting clinical profile distinct from what we have seen previously reported and we\u2019re moving that into triple negative breast cancers. And in immunooncology, as you know, we are collaborating with Merck on combining 41B BB with RPD1 and that study will soon start. And over the next year we plan to bring in to clinical studies on [40] antibody followed by PD1. So during the latter part of 2015, we will have a significant oncoimmunology portfolio. And then of course we have a Phase I ongoing with a full on to cell core that shows a real interesting profile. So this was just a brief overview of some of the more interesting compound building on what Ian said we have breadth and depth in talents and pipeline here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Maybe just go back to some questions in the first half of the Q&A, if you would tolerate that. Number one, maybe for Ian. Ian, speaking again about BD, could you perhaps, if possible, kind of prioritize therapeutic areas for us that you're interested in? I know -- I remember as recently as last summer, you had mentioned a few therapeutic areas you're most interested in. I was understanding what your priorities are now. And then within that commentary, perhaps you could comment on strategically whether it would make sense to add, to -- whether it would make sense to add a significant generics component to your current business. ","And then a two-part question for Mikael, I may. Mikael, could you update us on conversations you may have had with the regulators in the last several months around the PCSK9 class? I know Pfizer had spoken before about how you thought perhaps outcome struggles might be necessary prior to registration. I was just wondering what your current thoughts are. And then also, just summarize your CAR T-cell program that you recently inlicensed and how it differs from the programs that are a little bit ahead. Thanks. ","Ian Read"," ","Thank you, Mark, and on BD clearly you want to do BD way, you have potential for not only organic growth but synergy, so you\u2019d like look at the BD where you already are strong in therapeutic areas whether it\u2019s pain, oncology or vaccines. Just to mention a few, anything that would you utilize a primary care field force would be of interest to us. And adding a significant generic component, we would look at as you say, we look at all alternatives if it fits it will make sense, if we see we can leverage it in the emerging markets, if we see there is organic growth we could produce from it, we could certainly consider it. I mean we are open to a wide range of business development activities that we believe that we can acquire at a good value for our shareholders. Mikael on the question on PCSK9 and then I think the cart technologies.","Mikael Dolsten","So Mark thank you for the interest in R&D program. So first on PCSK9, we have a very large clinical program that of course includes LDL [indiscernible] and a significant severe outcome study involving those patients with less than 100 patients above 100 in cholesterol and includes prime and second prevention. And we think actually it\u2019s the broadest program available which could you know of course bring a real insight to patients efficient and to regulators. We think it\u2019s difficult to speculate if regulators will approve with LDL alone or wait for outcome studies I think it depends how other studies that are reading out.","We deliver on the correlation between LDL lowering in a variety of CV patients groups to outcome, but I would underline that it\u2019s our view that what would really matter for the up take in their marketplace, my dialogues with Geno is very much that pays. We look for outcome studies and we think we have a premier outcome program and we think it would deliver timely to competitors. ","Concerning Cellectis, it\u2019s another Pfizer entry into the different modality of oncology and I am pleased to share with you that the Cellectis is the company that use allogeneic cause which has the upside that it\u2019s not a complex procedure but you could actually in a more industrialized process provide a defined cellular treatment for thousands of patients.","Cellectis as a unique tail-end technology that allows them to modify and optimize those cells with a position that made it very attractive for us to make a deal and it\u2019s a significant collaboration including more than 15 targets by Pfizer. And also we are supporting some targets that Cellectis will develop and we have first rights to refusal for those few Cellectis targets. ","And it includes a number of technologies such as giving the cell the specificity such as introducing signals that allow it illuminate the cells making the cells resistant to certain standard of care that the patient may be receiving as well as enhancing the course by possibly knocking out molecules such as the PD-1 creating super course. So I just gave you a flavor of what I think we and Cellectis will unequally do in the industry and it really combines our in-depth ability in engineering of biological with Cellectis new medicine.","Operator","Your final question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen","Thank you very much. I have three questions. What is your level of confidence around the August 13 ACIP vote on Prevnar 13 in adults? Would you say, for instance, that you're highly confident in the vote? Secondly, regarding the neratinib comment earlier in the call, were you suggesting that you believe you have some legal right to gain greater participation than just the 13% royalty? And then thirdly, I would think you have kept a close eye on developments at AstraZeneca maybe involving evolution of the pipeline, and I'm wondering if you would share any observations. Thank you.","Ian Read"," ","Okay on AstraZeneca, I really don\u2019t want make any comments. It\u2019s a very complicated legal situation whether you take a look at and I think it\u2019s thus remain silent so far that Steve but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand right. As Doug, you could comment on neratinib.","Doug Lankler ","","Sure, as we indicated before we did not see the data and believe we should \u2013 to that data and we are in the process of reviewing our contractual rights.","Ian Read"," ","I think what we\u2019re basically talking about is that we were in negotiations with them and we believe we have contractual rights to see data that we are reviewing our options. And ACIP, Albert?","Albert Bourla","","I don\u2019t want to speculate what the ACIP decision would be but I\u2019m very optimistic and I think that the policy options that they proposed were both favorable, actually commercially neutral for us because either will be the only or would be the first, a vax inverter will be administered.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning. During my remarks today, I will briefly talk about the progress and opportunities within each of our businesses and the areas where we see the greatest potential in our pipeline.","Year to date, our performance is on plan, and the results for the quarter are operationally comparable with the prior-year quarterly performance. If you exclude the impact of the Hospira Infusion Systems divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues for the quarter increased 2% operationally compared to the prior-year quarter. We also raised the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for the year. When you look at our projected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for this year and add the dividend yield, it is approximately 11%.","I'll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, beginning with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another strong quarter, growing its top line by 9% operationally, driven by the performance of the core brands that are key revenue drivers: notably Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz. Their solid performance is enabling us to improve our growth profile through continued market penetration and the potential for additional new indications that are nearer term with Xeljanz and in the future of Ibrance. For example, we have submitted regulatory filings for two potentially new indications for Xeljanz in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. As you may know, later this week there's an FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee meeting to vote on a recommendation for a psoriatic arthritis indication.","Now a few comments on the performance of Xtandi. This quarter we continue to see strong underlying demand. Total sales were $300.7 million in quarter two 2017, up 10% from first quarter 2017, which translated into 8% growth for Pfizer's Xtandi alliance revenues. Of note, the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi in a given month reached an all-time high in May. This is a key factor, given that increasing Xtandi prescribing by urologists was one of the commercial opportunities we identified for Xtandi prior to the acquisition. I would note that the patient assistance program proportion of total demand was comparable with the first quarter. We expect that the patient assistance program utilization will normalize as we move into next year.","We're also excited about the amendment to the protocol of the Phase 3 PROSPER trial of Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. We believe this will accelerate the timeline for potentially expanding the indication for Xtandi to include non-metastatic CRPC by two years. With our collaboration partner Astellas, we anticipate having top line data later this year and soon hope to provide Xtandi to more men with earlier stages of prostate cancer. Expanding the indication for Xtandi is another key factor and a value driver for realizing the product's full commercial potential as we continue to conduct trials evaluating the use of Xtandi in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, allowing us to potentially move into even earlier settings, including the ARCHES trial in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and the EMBARK trial in non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.","Regarding the PARP inhibitor talazoparib, enrollment in the EMBRACA Phase 3 study in germline BRCA-positive breast cancer closed in April of this year, and we're expecting top line results by January of next year. We continue to be very confident on the potential of the molecule and have an aggressive development plan that includes monotherapy and combinations with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to breast cancer, we are evaluating the potential to develop talazoparib in prostate cancer and in combination with avelumab in various tumor types. Overall, we remain confident that the Medivation acquisition was a good investment that will deliver value for the patients we serve and our shareholders.","As you know, we closed the Anacor acquisition last year. We are seeing a solid uptake in the demand for Eucrisa. Sequential prescription demand increased more than two-and-a-half-fold. Due to the timing of building the inventory, which is normal during the initial launch period, net revenues did not follow the same pattern of growth. We expect this will normalize when we move forward, and we'll start seeing net revenue sequentially grow in quarter three.","In our vaccine business for Prevnar 13, the recommendations and associated reimbursement in key EU countries for Prevnar 13 in the adult population have taken longer than anticipated. I would note that in the EU reimbursement is a second step, which differs from the U.S., where ACIP governs both. We continue to work in securing additional recommendations and reimbursement programs within the EU adult population.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. While revenues for the quarter declined, we saw good operational growth in emerging markets and in Biosimilars, primarily in certain developed markets. Within Biosimilars, Inflectra uptake in the U.S. is being driven by a number of factors, including Inflectra's clinical package, patient support programs, price differentials versus innovators by channel, and the access reimbursement environment. To date, reimbursement coverage has been mixed. While we achieved 100% Medicare coverage, we have experienced access challenges among national commercial payers, where our lower price product has not received access at parity to the innovative product and remains in a disadvantaged position despite recent price increases taken by the innovative product. Given our extensive experience working with commercial payers, we will look at all relevant factors impacting reimbursement to determine next steps to enable greater access for Inflectra. In aggregate, we have a strong Biosimilars portfolio and remain on track with our plans to file six biosimilar assets in the U.S.","As we saw this quarter, the PEH business continues to be impacted by LOE events, specifically Pristiq in the U.S. We also faced two upcoming events: Viagra in the U.S. later this year and Lyrica in the U.S. at the end of 2018. To counter these headwinds, the PEH business is refining and strengthening its portfolio to ultimately pivot the business to grow. One example is a focus on our anti-infectives. Late last year we acquired AstraZeneca's small molecule anti-infective business, and we just completed a license agreement with Basilea for the commercialization rights in Europe for Cresemba, a novel antifungal treatment for potential life-threatening fungal infections among immunocompromised patients.","The scale and global reach of our PEH business is unparalleled in the industry. With its broad portfolio that span 600 essential medicines, it impacts the lives of more than 300 million patients in about 160 countries. Emerging markets play a key role in enabling the business to achieve its growth objectives. This quarter PEH revenues in emerging markets grew 5% operationally year over year. The most robust revenue growth came from the largest areas of PEH businesses within the emerging markets, namely legacy established brands and sterile injectables.","Turning now to the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline with a steady flow of scientific innovation coming from Pfizer's key therapeutic areas. Over the next five years, we project the potential for about 25 to 30 approvals, of which up to 15 have the potential to be blockbusters. And we believe half of these potential blockbusters could achieve approval by 2020. The most noteworthy highlights include: In Oncology, we see an opportunity for five different potential blockbuster approvals over the five years, including Xtandi in non-metastatic prostate cancer and Ibrance in early adjuvant breast cancer. We also see the opportunity for a number of Bavencio IO combinations, including doublets and triplets such as targeted combinations like avelumab and Inlyta or (11:59) IOi combinations like avelumab plus 4-1BB. And we believe we have a leadership opportunity with Bavencio combined with chemotherapy for ovarian and head and neck cancer indications.","In Vaccines, we see the opportunity for three potential blockbusters, including our next-generation valent pneumococcal vaccine, which is in Phase 1 and we are working to accelerate given the continued burden of disease. We plan to start Phase 2 by the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, our C. difficile vaccine is in Phase 3, and Staph aureus vaccine in Phase 2b, both of which have fast-track designation.","In Inflammation & Immunology, we are in the registration phase for Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. We have a comprehensive program of several unique next-generation JAK inhibitors across multiple dermatological, gastrointestinal, and rheumatological indications. We have recently completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for our JAK1 selective oral molecule in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and are assessing the data with the potential to advance the program.","In Rare Disease and Internal Medicines, we have several pivotal Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs ongoing. This includes a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Phase 3 trial for rivipansel for sickle-cell disease, tafamidis in TTR cardiomyopathy, and tanezumab for chronic pain.","And in Biosimilars we have several assets across major cancer and inflammatory diseases which we believe are high-value opportunities. In total there are 14 distinct biosimilar assets in the pipeline, eight of which are in mid- to late-stage development, and six assets are in early-stage.","In summary, the business is executing on our strategy. Our Innovative business is generating strong growth and is positioned to continue this growth. Our Essential Health business has well-documented revenue growth challenges in the near term given the upcoming LOE events but generates very strong cash flow, and it's working to solidify long-term growth drivers within its portfolio. We see a very attractive next wave of noteworthy pipeline products potentially starting in the next two years, and we expect there will not be a significant impact from expected LOEs during the period 2020 through 2025.","Given this backdrop, over the near term our focus is to maximize the market opportunities we see for our inline portfolio as we continue to advance the pipeline while managing our cost structure and delivering attractive financial performance. Our businesses and our people are well-prepared and stand ready to meet the challenges posed by the uncertainties that exist domestically and in the global markets where we operate. Our compass remains bringing new therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives and create value for our shareholders.","Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results of the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.","Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $12.9 billion and reflect a slight year-over-year operational decline of $48 million. Second quarter 2017 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $202 million or 2%. If you exclude both the revenues for HIS in both periods, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2017 revenues increased $248 million or 2%.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 9% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2017, driven by Ibrance and Eliquis globally; the addition of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition in September of 2016; and Xeljanz and Lyrica, both primarily in the U.S. \u2013 all of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition and the 7% operational decrease in global Prevnar 13 revenues.","In the U.S., Prevnar 13 declined 16% due to the unfavorable impact, the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication, and the continuing decline in revenues for the adult indication because of a smaller remaining catch-up opportunity versus the prior-year quarter. In international markets, however, Prevnar 13 revenues increased 8% operationally due to the favorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication in certain emerging markets.","Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased to 12% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of this year. The remainder of the decline was due to a 27% operational decline from peri-LOE products such as Pristiq in the U.S., which lost marketing exclusivity in March of 2017, Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe markets, as well as a 3% operational decline in legacy established products, all of which were partially offset by a 60% operational growth from biosimilars, driven by Inflectra in certain developed Europe markets and in the U.S.","In emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 5% operationally, primarily due to 7% operational growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 10% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio. Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.51, compared with $0.33 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower asset impairment charges, higher gross margins, and lower legal charges, all of which were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.67 versus $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a higher gross margin and fewer shares outstanding. I want to point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 112 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of two $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements, one completed in June of 2016, the other executed in February of 2017 and completed in May of 2017.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $202 million or 2% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $247 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus a year-ago quarter.","We increased the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.02 to reflect the $300 million increase to the guidance for adjusted other income and deducts as a result of lower-than-forecasted net interest expense, higher-than-forecasted royalty income from certain products, and higher-than-anticipated dividend income from ViiV. As a result, we now expect 2017 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.60. I want to point out that our updated adjusted diluted EPS guidance range absorbs $75 million of adjusted research and development expenses that were recorded in the second quarter 2017 due to our agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, which we announced in May 2017 to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for hemophilia A.","To punctuate what Ian said earlier, the midpoint of our updated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is $2.57, versus our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40 implies a growth rate of approximately 7% year over year, which is above that of our peer group average. In addition, this implied year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate, in conjunction with our current dividend yield of 3.8% to 3.9%, equates to approximately 11%, which is again above that of our peer group average and which we believe is robust for a company of our size. With the exception of increasing the midpoint of the range for our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS and increasing guidance for adjusted other income\/deducts, we reaffirmed all other 2017 financial guidance components.","Now moving on to key takeaways, we continued to deliver solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding HIS revenues from both periods, revenues increased 2% operationally year over year, driven by the strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz and the contribution of the newly acquired products including Xtandi. We increased the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.02. We now expect the range to be from $2.54 to $2.60. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, which includes a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Can we now go to the operator to poll for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, team. First for Ian and Frank, last quarter you suggested that doing big deals might be on hold tied to uncertainty on tax reform, as well as binary events in the industry. So looking for your updated thoughts on that. Taking a wild guess here that MYSTIC might've been one of those binary events. And my second question is for John. I was intrigued by Ian's comments about the Remicade \u2013 Remicade holding on commercial \u2013 commercial plans in particular. Now that Merck has jumped into the biosimilar Remicade market, can you talk about the implications of where they set price and what you think it's going to take to get Inflectra ramping the way you hope in the next couple of years? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. Well, as we've always said, we have a base plan, and we look to improve that plan. And part of that may be improving or changing our capital allocations. We look at BD as a way of improving returns for shareholders, and right now I would reaffirm that I think there are short-term events in the marketplace, such as a tax reform, that may change asset values. So any focus on BD, to my point of view, is somewhat delayed by a resolution of that. And I'll ask John to talk about the Remicade.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the question. So, first of all, let me just be clear that the Merck biosimilar, Renflexis, launched at exactly our Inflectra ASP. So ASP is the average selling price that is set by CMS on a quarterly basis. It is $753 for Inflectra, and that was exactly the price that Merck announced the pricing of Renflexis to be last week. So actually their pricing essentially is exactly on parity with our price.","In terms of the second part of your question, which is what do we think it's going to take to really accelerate performance, I think I would just start by saying actually overall biosimilar revenue was $121 million in the quarter. It grew by 60%, and that included $23 million of sales in the U.S. We continue to see the value of biosimilars in the marketplace and expanding patient access to important high-quality, lower-cost treatment options, but we know the market is still in development. Inflectra penetration in the U.S. has been slower than we expected due to some challenging marketplace dynamics. By the end of June, our Inflectra share was 2.3% of the overall infliximab volume, and that includes a mix of new and switch patients, as every provider customer is taking a different approach to adoption.","But we've made steady progress to improve the availability of Inflectra through contracting with GPOs. We've achieved some wins with integrated healthcare systems, particularly those where the insurer and provider are the same. The VA would be a good example of such a provider, where we actually have an infliximab share of 20% or more, and that continues to grow. With insurance plans, we've achieved 100% coverage for Medicare patients. But in the commercial insurance space, access for Inflectra has been substantially limited due to J&J's pursuit of exclusionary contracting with insurers and providers.","And as Ian said in his comments, our lower-price product hasn't received access at parity to Remicade, and it does remain, in that sector of the market, at a disadvantaged position. So we are actively working on a range of commercial and other strategies to make Inflectra accessible to more patients and also make sure we lay the groundwork for a smoother and more rapid uptake of all future biosimilars in the U.S. marketplace.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thanks, John and Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Ian, just \u2013 if I can just go back to the capital allocation question again. If I take your words in your prepared remarks or in the press release literally, it does sound like you're backing off from a large-scale deal and saying that you're going to focus on maximizing internal opportunities. And this coming off of the first six months of the year where you and your senior management have been on the road talking up your core competency of doing major acquisitions and aggressive cost-cutting. And that after two failed mergers to lower your tax rate and that around the time that you plan to break up the company into three parts and then two parts.","So it's just a little bit confusing what the message today is to investors. I mean, we understand that corporate tax reform is facing some headwinds and uncertainty, but that was also true after Q1. So just trying to get a sense for your general priorities here. Is it to get bigger in order to break up? Is it to lower your tax rate? Is it to get bigger in oncology? Is it to achieve significant cost synergies? I think we're all a little bit confused about that, and if you could clarify.","My second question, again going back to MYSTIC, just curious to know what you think the failure of MYSTIC tells you. We have heard that you have said in the past that if it did fail it would place a higher value on the PD-1 leaders, but just wondering how you think about that. Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Jami. I'm sorry it's confusing. I don't think we've changed our approach at all in the seven years that I've been CEO. Our focus has always been to use BD as part of capital allocation to improve returns to Pfizer shareholders, and we look at it in the totality of our capital allocation. For instance, since September 2015 \u2013 not to use since 2010 but 2015 \u2013 we've paid out $12.9 billion in dividends, we've repurchased $10 billion of our shares, and we've spent $36 billion in BD. So we have been active in BD.","Now you're asking me about, have we backed off any intention to do a big deal? My answer to that is we will look at the circumstances and the asset prices and determine the appropriate capital allocation when we feel that we have a realistic handle on what asset prices truly represent. And right now I believe we need to see tax reform or the absence of tax reform to understand what the market values are. We then would look at BD opportunities inside other opportunities with capital allocation, including share buybacks and dividends, investing in our own portfolio. And rest assured we will aggressively take the actions that we believe will improve the value to shareholders.","Now in regard to MYSTIC. I think MYSTIC certainly indicated that the IO-IO may be more problematical in the near term. Certainly I think reinforces the value of PD-L1 franchises and where they stand in the different therapies, and which order they stand. Surprisingly, the market didn't infer that really through to the other CTLA-4. We only saw it narrowly in MYSTIC. So I'm not quite sure what the market is saying that they believe that the read-through is. So we really want to see the full report, not just the top line. But certainly I think it strengthens the case that the PD-L1 is going to be for the foreseeable future a major player in the game. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. First on Ibrance, if you could just update us on the latest market share penetration \u2013 very impressive results. So just want to get a better sense as to what the upside there is. And then on Xeljanz, wanted to \u2013 again, solid performance. Wanted to get your thoughts on the latest, I guess, concerns about the risk of thromboembolic events with JAK inhibitors. And then finally, Ian, very impressive commentary about the R&D potential. Would you be interested, or are you considering, hosting an R&D day so that the investment community can better appreciate the potential of this pipeline? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Alex. Thank you for the recommendation of the R&D day. We'll have a discussion internally and see what we think is the best way to communicate that more and more fully. I would ask Albert to talk about Ibrance, and then Mikael Dolsten to talk about the issues you raised with \u2013 or the potential issues you raised around Xeljanz. Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian, and thank you, Alex, for your good words for Ibrance. Look, for Kisqali, it is a little bit early to comment, but so far we have seen a minimal uptake of this product. Its most recent market share has been 4% across all lines, 5% in first line. We have seen some early signs of market growth. The CDK market share in new patients has grown from an historical 50% to approximately 57%, indicating that the Kisqali introduction could potentially grow the total market. As you know, only 50% of the patients that they could receive benefits from CDK treatments are now under a CDK program.","We remain confident in our leadership in the class. Two years, more than 10,500 prescribers, more than 60,000 patients in the U.S., now more than 13,000 patients in the EU in just a few months from the beginning of the year. And this is testament not only to Ibrance's efficacy with over two years PFS, but also to its manageable safety and tolerability profile with no EKG or liver monitor required. And, last but not least, we have great access for patients. So we are very optimistic for the future of the project.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So thank you for the question concerning, I assume, the recent news surrounding venous thromboembolism for baricitinib, and you wanted to learn about Xeljanz. We are very pleased with the profile for Xeljanz. It has been extremely consistent, and our analysis from more than 21,000 patient-years in clinical studies and postmarketing experience in over 90,000 patients shows that there is no causal relationship between Xeljanz and venous thromboembolism. We have not seen any signals for thrombosis. This suggests that not all JAKs are the same, and the news around baricitinib is likely to be seen as compound specific and not JAK class specific.","I wanted also to add, as an example that underlines this, barcitinib has reported elevated platelets, thrombocytosis, which in some circumstances can be associated with increased risk for thrombosis. We have not seen that either with our Xeljanz inhibitor, and we are very pleased with its balanced and well-performing profile. Indeed, this week there was a Lancet oral strategy report that underlined how well Xeljanz was performing and compared its profile in a very, I think, favorable way also to Humira in that study. Thank you for your interest.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple product questions and then one tax question. First on Xtandi, you mentioned patient assistance dynamics are expected to normalize as we move into next year. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what drives that confidence? And should we think about an uplift in realized price as that occurs?","Second question was Prevnar 13 adult in the EU. I think you mentioned here reimbursement's been a bit slower. What are the hurdles that are affecting that uptake? And is there anything the company can do to either accelerate this or address this?","And then the final question was on this topic of U.S. tax reform. What are the key elements that Pfizer is looking for as we go through tax reform in order for the company to best optimize its capital structure? Is repatriation the critical piece? Is the absolute tax rate the critical piece? I guess what aspects of tax reform are you most focused on as we hear various proposals over the coming weeks and months? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, Chris, thank you for the questions.","On Xtandi, what we've discussed previously is that access to Xtandi in its present setting is concentrated more heavily in patients who are on Medicare or Medicaid, and there are access barriers there. And the industry in total have dealt with this by allowing foundations to provide funds to those patients to meet some of their copay obligations, and it's been done from a third-party stance, with us donating money to foundations who then dedicate themselves to making sure that individuals have access to these medications. There was a temporary, I think, chilling of that under a subpoena and some investigations from the legal system, which we believe that are temporary in nature and that there are clear guidelines as to how this should be done by different government agencies. We are clarifying these or have clarified them, and we believe the industry will return to funding these foundations within the established and clear guidelines of the U.S. government.","Hence, we would expect that the percentage of patients who are on our patient assistance program will drop as they move towards the foundation covering their copays. This will tend to be more abrupt at the beginning of the year, as most patient assistance programs guarantee you access for the remainder of the calendar year whenever you join. And then when the calendar year changes, then most of these patients or new patients, we believe, will likely turn to the foundations as a source of financing or help with their copays.","I would ask \u2013 Prevnar adult; would you like to talk about that, Albert, in the European situation?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Absolutely. And, Chris, let me start by restating that we're not changing this in our assessments. We expect the Vaccines business to be flat to slightly declining in 2017. Now, in developed Europe, our revenues for the adult claim in the second quarter, they grew slightly. We had the 2% growth compared to the same quarter of last year. Year to date, we are growing double digit at 15%, and this is in line with our expectations so far.","In Europe, the vaccine business is all about recommendations and subsequently reinvestment, and the process is slow, as Ian said. We wanted and we were hoping to be a little bit faster. And right now most of the effect of the reimbursement we expect to happen in 2018. To give you some examples, in France in April there was a national at-risk recommendation, but the process of getting from recommendation to reinvestment will likely take us into 2018. Before France, in the first quarter, Italy announced new national recommendations for 65, but then there is \u2013 from recommendation to reimbursement also takes some time. We continue to advocate with both the European technical committees for recommendations and payers for reinvestment.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So, thank you, Albert. I think net-net we realize that the Prevnar franchise is difficult to forecast, so we have given \u2013 I think in the last quarter we gave guidance that the total franchise will be flat to slightly down on a full-year basis, and I think that's what you should use for your modeling. Frank, why don't you talk about the tax situation?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, Chris. So I think in terms of what we'd like to see for tax reform, I think first a territorial tax system. Two, a repatriation holiday. Three, lower corporate tax rates. And then, four, and this kind of applies to a couple of these, which is if there's going to be some minimum tax, obviously the lower the minimum tax the better.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And we believe that type of reform will make us more competitive. It's not as good as a pure territorial system, but within the art of the possible and what they're trying to achieve, that would help us access our global capital.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two. First on Consumer, I think you previously had \u2013 or shown little interest in any kind of disposal of this business, but as we're continuously talking about consolidation of pharma and on the watch for pharma asset prices, could this be a potential source of funds that is worth more in the hands of others rather than yourselves going forwards? That's the first question.","And then second, you talk about a number of blockbuster opportunities; obviously adjuvant Ibrance is one of those. That's more than just a $1 billion opportunity. I would think it's very much more substantial than the metastatic opportunity. I wonder, can you can give us any more thoughts around potential timing with that being a partially event-driven study for a readout there? And then what kind of size do you think the market for adjuvant breast cancer could be for the CDKs? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. On the Consumer business, I think we've commented on this before. We're investing in it, it's growing, it's a good source of U.S. cash flow, and we see stable growth. But the Consumer business, like any of our businesses, we subject to periodic reviews as to whether there'd be more value created being outside of Pfizer rather than in. And clearly, as we discussed before on this tax reform, the tax reform will change the net value of assets in the marketplace in various ways, and we think it's prudent to wait for a decision on tax reform so that we can really understand the valuation of our assets as we do these reviews across all of our business.","Now, with regard to Ibrance, Albert, would you like to take that one?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, and you're right, we also believe that the opportunity in the early breast cancer is much larger than the opportunity of metastatic breast cancer. The populations are more than double, and the duration of treatments are expected to be much longer. So we are looking forward to bring in the Ibrance label the claim of early breast cancer.","Now, as regards the studies that we are running, in early breast cancer we have three studies that are running. The first one is PENELOPEB. And this is for high-risk early breast cancer patients. The estimated completion date of this is in 2020. The second is PALLAS, which is for patients with intermediate-risk early breast cancer, and we have here an estimated primary completion date in 2021. And there's also PALLET, which is a smaller study that has an estimation completion date end of 2018, beginning of 2019.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","These are all event-driven trials.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","And these are all event-driven trial. This is a little bit difficult to estimate, and the better the product does, usually the events delay to complete. We need to wait see the results.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the IO strategy for a minute, perhaps starting with the backbone itself. I notice you have an in-house PD-1, as well as the avelumab collaboration. So just wanted to understand how you're thinking about positioning both? And also on that same tone, you also have an investigational monthly subQ arm for your in-house PD-1, the wholly owned one. Any early thoughts on that? Was very curious.","And stepping outside of the whole PD-1 side, I find it interesting you do have preclinical CTLA-4s, you have a preclinical IDO. So, from your perspective, do you think you have everything you need for IO-IO combos in these particular assets? Or would you rather have something more advanced depending on the trial results in the next few months? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. It's a very complicated and deep question, the whole issue of IO strategy. I'm going to sort of ask perhaps Mikael to make some initial scientific comments on the overall target selection and then have Albert add comments on the commercial implications. What I would point out is that in immuno-oncology, we certainly feel we have a good PD-L1 in partnership with Merck from Germany, but undoubtedly the depth of our clinical exploration is not the size of either of the two major competitors who have PD-L1s who are ahead of us. But, Mikael, why don't you -","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. So I'll briefly touch upon what are key things to keep in mind here. As Ian alluded to, we are pleased with our partnership with Merck KGaA on avelumab, and we have more than 30 studies ongoing and some 10 that are in registration \u2013 intent fashion. Among those, I wanted to mention that we think we will be in a leadership role for ovarian cancer, both advanced, second, and third line, as well as first line in chemo combinations. We think we'll also have a leadership position in RCC due to various promising data reported for Inlyta in combination with avelumab at ASCO. And you may have seen recently also that Inlyta is running a combination also with Keytruda, and that will solidify, we think, that Inlyta drug combined with either avelumab or other PD-1 drugs. And finally, in head and neck cancer, combining radiotherapy and chemo we also think we can establish unique leadership for avelumab.","More recently, the organically generated PD-1, which is part of the alliance with German Merck, showed a very well-behaved molecule suitable for monthly delivery and good early efficacy signals. So we are looking at opportunities where that profile may have a differentiated role, such as treatment of very early cancers or possibly adjuvant cancers, and we will share more quite near term about how we see that molecule.","When it comes to combination, we are eager to see the readout of the areas where we think we are unique. Our 4-1BB should have data reporting later part of this year, OX40 with avelumab early next year, and a triple the later part of next year.","Finally, you spoke about CTLA-4. Clearly the native CTLA-4 antibodies have shown a tricky balance between efficacy and adverse events. We have embarked on modified CTLA-4 where we have two preclinical compounds that we think can have a more tumor-specific effect and a mitigated systemic effect to explore whether that second generation can be more easily developed. Albert, anything you want to add here?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So I think you gave a very extensive answer, Mikael. I would just add that our internally developed PD-L1 \u2013 as you say, it's earlier use; it's used in the adjuvant setting. If we can get its administration subQ, it would be a very important differentiating factor there. But, Albert, do you want to add anything?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","No, no, no. Just what you just said. That could mean treatment in home versus treatment in the infusion centers, which makes a big difference.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","A big difference. Okay.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Ian. How do you feel about the administration's understanding of the drug industry and its contribution to jobs and innovation? Maybe you could tell us a little bit how you've been integrating or engaging with the administration. And do you think what we've heard and seen so far as to potential executive orders is really what we should expect, which is marginal or incremental change, not price controls or anything more ominous? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, David. Well, we've had long conversations about this. I believe that the pharma industry has worked hard, along with other parts of the healthcare industry, to ensure that the administration has a full view of the contribution that the industry makes. It's a \u2013 I think $1.6 trillion contribution to GDP, the pharmaceutical industry, and about 4 million jobs that are created by this industry. And we are the only part of the industry that actually prices go down. If you did a triple bypass operation 10 years ago, compare that to what you pay today, it has significantly gone up, whereas Lipitor has significantly gone down in price. So we're one of the few parts of the healthcare system that automatically have price reductions built in and the utility of that product remains for society.","So we've been working and discussing with this administration. I think they understand the importance of the industry. They understand the importance of innovation. And I would expect that we've discussed with the administration that any executive order should help increase competition, should help get generic products to the market faster. This is where in fact most of what we may call \u2013 has been called \u2013 outrageous pricing issues have occurred in the generics sector. The Brand Effect has only seen a 2.3% price increase in 2016. So there seems to be a mischaracterization of what's creating issues.","Cost and affordability is an issue for most patients because of large deductibles and high copays and the fact that the rebates that we give to insurance companies to help get access are not being used to ensure the patient pays the net price after the rebate. And this has been a conversation we've been having with the administration. So overall I think we've given several suggestions to the administration. It's been a good conversation, and I expect that from a public policy point of view, the administration understands the importance of our industry to patients.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. Ian, just a question on the environment. Over your seven-year tenure, what are some of the things that appear to be going right for the industry? Seems like on the regulatory front, certainly the FDA is approving things, and cycle times are coming down. But certainly on the generics side you're getting a lot faster approval of ANDAs. On the reimbursement side, certainly seems to be a lot of pressure. But just some general commentary about the environment and the pushes and pulls that are going on there.","Secondly, you mentioned that some of your businesses are subjected to periodic reviews. You have the Genetics Institute business that's in hemophilia. You have some competitive threats there from ACE910 and gene therapies. Have you considered a spin or split of that business like one of your peers had recently done?","And then lastly for Frank, just on foreign exchange. Certainly, the headwind is lessening, but you didn't move your guidance range on revenues at all. Can you maybe just discuss some of the pushes and pulls there that forced you to leave guidance where it was? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John, wide-ranging questions. I think in the environment, certainly on the registry side through actions taken by the FDA, certainly the new commissioner and the PDUFA negotiations I think we're beginning to see an improvement in the FDA's speed in approving and bringing new products to the marketplace. I would say the oncology division is probably one that I would call out as being the most active there.","On the negative side of the situation, I suppose you would say that we've seen increased pressure from payers. We've seen the marketplace devolve a little bit into high deductibles, high copays, which is denying access to patients, which is not well-understood. And overall I think we've also seen an uptick in our ability to take science and take what we've learned in science over the last few years to improve our understanding of how to get vaccines and precision medicine through to the marketplace.","On the hemophilia franchise, we think we're well-placed. While I would agree with you, we are seeing entrances that have longer half-lives, but we think we have a strategy to use that business and move on to new formulations and new products. And I would just ask Mikael to talk a little about our research in that area.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you. As you mentioned, John, gene therapy has the potential to transform incremental gains by slightly increasing half-life. We have shared with Spark Therapeutics recently experiences from factor IX for hemophilia B patients. 10 patients have been dosed, single infusion. We see a robust level of synthetic gene giving rise to dramatic reduction in bleedings or the need for any infusions, and patients basically without the need for any treatment beyond a year or year and a half, because this is as far as we've gone in the observation period.","As we noted at \u2013 advance in the field, we recently licensed, in a partnership with Sangamo, a factor VIII gene therapy, which is quite a big market. We're just embarking on clinical studies with that. And we are exploring to take a step into really difficult diseases like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. We're planning our internal program to go into the clinical study early next year. So as Ian alluded to, we decided to move from more incremental to more transformative therapies, and so far are very encouraged about the quality of these technologies.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Frank, would you like to do the -","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Foreign exchange?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","\u2013 foreign exchange?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So, John, you're correct. If you look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue guidance, let's say the first call we had this year, early February, to today's call, it's a negative, but it's less of a negative. So you're absolutely correct, and the reason we chose not to change guidance was there's many parts of the portfolio that are performing very well. We've mentioned some of those today \u2013 Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz \u2013 but there's other parts of the portfolio that we've mentioned today that aren't performing the way we thought they were going to from a planning perspective. We mentioned Inflectra on the call. We mentioned Xtandi on the call. We mentioned Prevnar 13 adult in Europe on the call. So when we put that all together, we thought it was prudent to leave the revenue range where it is, $52 billion to $54 billion.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank. Next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I want go back to Inflectra if I can, your comments about being disadvantaged. Am I correct to think that the only way to overcome the reimbursement hurdles is price, and the experience of payers today basically says the product is priced too high? Or could it simply be a prediction by payers that prescriber demand just won't be there regardless of price? And to answer that, I think one of the ways you could \u2013 would be to look in channels where you do have full coverage \u2013 I think you said Medicare \u2013 and what the uptake has been in those channels.","And then another question is one that I've asked in the past, so forgive me, but your commitment to avelumab, you've described in the past, but I interpret to be to be kind of an unwavering commitment to that relationship and to that product. So is that a fair characterization? Is it full speed ahead with avelumab?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. On avelumab, we were in a very good partnership with Merck. We have a plan to develop avelumab. You've heard on this call today where we think we can be successful in first line, where we can be successful in combinations. And we always review all of our strategies and all of our potentials to see how we can maximize participation in any sectors. So we're \u2013 have a strong partnership, but we continue to review the best way to be successful in IO combinations, but that extends beyond PD-L1. It extends to our own 4-1BB, our own OX40, our own other targeted agents, our own vaccine, oncolytic vaccine strategy there. So I think, as I say, we enjoyed a very good relationships with Merck. And the first question was \u2013 remind me again.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Inflectra.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Inflectra.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Inflectra. I think the key for me \u2013 and I'll ask John to expand upon it \u2013 is the issue of \u2013 I think we have the right strategy on our pricing strategy. I think we are competitive on price. But in enclosed systems we have a 20%-plus market share but in the commercial plans, certainly, there are exclusive provisions that are in place by the originator's owner that make penetration difficult regardless of price. John, would you like to add anything?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think Ian's covered it well, Tim. I think all I would say is we're very clear that by definition biosimilars are defined in law as being highly similar and having no clinically meaningful differences. So, therefore, we recognize the value proposition versus the originator has to offer value to the healthcare system in the form of savings. And I wouldn't add to Ian's comment other than to say we remain extremely vigilant as more competitors have and will continue to enter this and other marketplaces, that we need to offer our customers value in order for them to both stock and also to provide insurance coverage for their patients.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Oh, thanks. I've got two questions. On Xtandi, could Albert outline how he sees the opportunity in additional patient numbers from PROSPER if it reads out positively later this year? And then on pipeline efforts, could you just flesh out expectations for Besponsa in ALL and also just the filing timeline on lorlatinib? Thanks a lot.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, please see what you can \u2013 give an answer to those, and if you need, I'll ask Mikael to add a contribution.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. Let me start with PROSPER. We are very excited with the prospects of bringing Xtandi to early stages of prostate cancer, and PROSPER is just one of the studies that we are having running in order to do that. EMBARK, ARCHES, and PROSPER are three studies that are focused on early prostate cancer. EMBARK is focusing on non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, ARCHES in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer but early, and PROSPER in non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.","We think about, as we discussed in the breast cancer, the opportunity's significant because the population of early non-metastatic prostate cancer is almost double than the population of the current registered claims in the opportunity of Xtandi. And we are expecting the duration of treatments to be much longer, so significant commercial opportunity. Mikael, do you want to answer the \u2013 ?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. On lorlatinib and I think you also mentioned ALL and Besponsa.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","ALL and Besponsa, yes.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. On the R&D side, as Besponsa got approved in EU and we expect positive outcome soon in the U.S., it's a highly differentiated drug for patients at great need.","When it comes to lorlatinib, that drug has performed really well. It's to the best of my knowledge the second generation ALK\/ROS inhibitor that covers most mutations, mutations that patients progress on also on other currently new ALK inhibitors. And it also has good brain exposure for patients. So we, for us, it's really the best-in-class drug that can extend the franchise and complement Xalkori, and we expect to file it later this year.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Any quick comment on Besponsa?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Just, I wanted to say, first of all, I misheard the question. So, yes. On the Besponsa, it has received already registration in Europe. We have breakthrough designation, and fast track in \u2013 by the FDA for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. And ALL is an aggressive form of leukemia, has a very poor prognosis in adults, and has limited treatment options. And we estimate that approximately 2,250 new cases of ALL occurring in adults will be diagnosed in the U.S. every year. And, as a result, this represents a meaningful new option for patients and a meaningful opportunity for us.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Ian, just on the topic of deals. When I look at your NME slide, what strikes me is how crowded some of these categories are, and Rare Disease obviously looks less so, as is neurodegeneration. So I know ROI and tax reform are inputs, but how much does the landscape inform your priority for deals?","And then second question for Albert, can you go into a little bit more on the PROSPER protocol change, what went into the decision? Was it competitive? Was it something you were seeing in the data so far? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","So on the deals, a lot of areas are crowded. It's an issue of finding products that have significant clinical differentiation. And I think if you look through our franchises we see that we have that opportunity in Vaccines; we have the opportunity in Inflammation. We continue to see that opportunity in Oncology with the future development of Xtandi, with the PARP inhibitor of Ibrance, with the PD-1 strategy with Merck, which is a core part of our strategy. And I think if you extend it out into CVMED or internal medicine, we continue to see huge opportunities to differentiate in inflammation, in our JAK franchises. And in neuroscience it's a hard area, and we continue to work at it. We're sort of refocusing somewhat on neuroscience into sort of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and away from psychiatry.","But I think our deals need is to play to the strengths we have. The deal has to be part of a strategy, and the strategy is to strengthen your anchor disease areas and ensure you can get synergy savings and also \u2013 both synergy savings and synergies in the revenues. So I feel comfortable with the position we've taken on our deal targets.","Albert, do you want to comment on PROSPER?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. We did announce in June, together with Astellas, an amendment of the protocol for PROSPER, which is a multinational randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Xtandi. The primary purpose of the amendment is to revise the plan for the analysis of the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival and secondary endpoints. The amendments also reduce the target sample size to approximately 1,140.","Basically, the fundamental reason for the acceleration was that we were able to decouple the metastasis-free survival from the overall survival. And now the metastasis-free survival is the primary endpoint, and will read first. Because we knew we have let's say many more data that have been read out since the time that the protocol was established, we feel very comfortable in discussions with the FDA that we can maintain the same power and reduce the number of patients that are needed to complete the target sample size, and this is the reason for the acceleration. I want to say that, as I said, the enrollment has been completed in June, and results are expected this fall.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. We talked about Ibrance in the U.S. before, but can you give us a flavor for what's going on in Europe? How much geographical growth has there been? We've seen a pretty good ramp quarter to quarter; just trying to get a sense for how fast this ramp is going to occur over the next year or so?","Second, Xeljanz, can you just give us a flavor for how it's being used? How much is being used second line or third line or just \u2013 we haven't heard from you on that in a while.","And then, third, can you give us an update on the trends in China and how that's going? Thanks.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yes.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Marc. Why don't \u2013 China, I'd ask just to have John start on China, which is \u2013 a major part of the business there comes under John's leadership, although Albert can also comment on the innovative in China. And then Ibrance and Xeljanz from Albert.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So China is our largest emerging market. It represents around about 45% of our emerging markets sales, and we see China remaining an attractive growth opportunity. In the quarter for the Essential Health business, revenues were around about $690 million, about 13% operational growth, and we continue to see strength across our portfolio for the Essential Health business. Our portfolio remains a great fit, with priority areas of treatment for the Chinese government, cardiovascular disease, treatment of serious infection, and other noncommunicable diseases. So we actually think that we're very well-placed to continue to grow our business in China. It's a major market where we have invested in the past, and we will continue to be opportunistic in making investments in order to drive our business.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Let's have Frank do the -","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Maybe Frank can talk about the overall performance of the company.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, I'll do enterprise-wide. So, for the quarter as well, China remains a very strong marketplace for us. For the quarter, revenues grew 13%. Year to date, revenues grew 16%, and that's compared to last year where revenues grew 11%. And just in terms of how we think about China, it has an increasing population, rising personal wealth, higher spending on healthcare and that's a government public objective \u2013 and continues to have a strong GDP. So when we look at China, we remain very bullish, and the results there have been very strong.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, if we can get to you on Xeljanz -","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. And Ibrance.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","\u2013 and Ibrance.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. You're right that Ibrance approvals are continuing across the world. In this quarter we've had approvals in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Jamaica, Jordan, and Oman. In total right now Ibrance is registered in more than 65 countries.","Specifically, in the EU and how we are doing there, through June or through the end of the quarter, the sales in the EU were approximately $200 million, and we have approximately 13,500 patients that have been treated. We are very, very pleased with this performance. Also, the early launch indicators \u2013 they saw very rapid Ibrance adoption in first line, but also we have very strong adoption in patients that have already been treated with AI monotherapy, with aromatase inhibitor monotherapy, and in patients in later lines of therapy. We are having positive discussions with reimbursement bodies right now, and generally speaking, I think they are doing well. So we are awaiting \u2013 as you know, in Europe it takes time to get the reimbursement, and that will accelerate the sales much more.","Coming to Xeljanz, Xeljanz demonstrated a very, very strong quarter. We had a growth of 56%, and this is primarily driven by volume. In the U.S., the same, 53%, the growth again primarily by volume. The reason of this growth is primarily because there is an increased confidence as an effective monotherapy agent. There is inclusion now in the ACR guidelines. The Xeljanz XR also played a significant role. Right now we have approximately 40% of the prescription volume in total and 60% of the new patients' prescriptions in Xeljanz XR. There is a growing brand awareness among patients. And, last but not least, we had significant improvement in access.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Salim Syed from Mizuho.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. We should move on to the next one.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Investments.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question. A brief two-part question. I'd love for you to comment on Mylotarg because after seven years it looks like it may be able to resurrect itself. And I'm curious if in fact now with chemotherapy as opposed to single agent, do you actually change the name? Or do you call it the same? And moreover, do you feel like (1:13:15) would be, let's just say, reticent to try it again even under the umbrella of chemotherapy? Or do you think they embrace it because there hasn't been much new in the AML \u2013 at least in newly diagnosed AML category in some time? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Interesting perspective, Tony. I think we intend to commercialize under its original brand name, and we feel that the new data package and the new label we have will lead to appropriate use of the product, and the physicians should be willing to embrace it. Thanks for the question.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","There was a positive opinion just a few weeks ago from an advisory committee in the FDA that was almost unanimous, I think it was minus one vote, to recommend the positive benefit-risk assessment.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. And, operator, if we can take our last question.","Operator","Your final question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. So first for your oncology team, I just wanted to get your perspective on CTLA-4's ability to offer a better benefit-risk ratio than chemo in lung cancer. And I ask you the question because obviously you previously owned the CTLA-4, you know the existing agents quite well, you're developing a more targeted set of early-stage CTLA-4 agents, but just wanted to get some perspective on your current opinion.","And then second, with respect to biosimilars, I was wondering if your biosimilars team is planning to conduct any U.S. biosimilar interchangeability studies? I ask because the Inflectra uptake has been disappointing and also because BI announced in the last few days that it's started enrolling patients in a U.S. Humira interchangeable study. Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. On CTLA-4, I'll ask Mikael to make some comments, but really his comments are more in the nature of his understanding of the science and general observations of his reading of the science. So, Mikael, what would you like to comment on CTLA-4?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, you know the CTLA-4 antibodies have played some role in melanoma and it's used as a treatment there. It has been hard, I think, looking at the science, as Ian says, to fully develop the potential of that system, as it has a very narrow therapeutic window between the benefit and the systemic side effects. And we noticed in the MYSTIC trials the difficulty of getting those regiments and patient selection at least initially to unleash the potential of that pathway. That led us to focus on second-generation CTLA-4. It's early stage, but aiming to see if we can deliver it more locally into the tumor when it comes to its efficacy. And we've also explored CTLA-4 locally delivered with vaccines, where we think we may be able to get a different type of balance as we've seen systemically. So that's my kind of science comment, and we'll carefully monitor the remaining ongoing trials and see what we can learn.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. John, you want to take the last question on \u2013 ?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So thanks, David, for the question. So on interchangeability, obviously that is still relatively new guidance from the FDA. We don't believe in our assessment that interchangeability is necessarily going to be equally important across all biosimilars. As a company, we are actively looking at our portfolio and assessing where we believe that actually interchangeability data and an interchangeability designation from the FDA may be valuable both commercially but also to patients and healthcare professionals and their ability to take up and use biosimilars.","And, lastly, I would say on Inflectra, just as a reminder, that obviously as the development program is completed by our partner Celltrion, we don't believe that the profile in the near term is going to be at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis any immediate competition that we see that would have an interchangeability designation vis-\u00e0-vis us, so we think we're going to have a level playing field there. So thanks for the question.","Charles E.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer\u2019s first quarter 2013 performance. I\u2019m joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer Business; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.","The slide that we\u2019ll be presenting can be viewed on our homepage by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance First Quarter 2013 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during the call will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer\u2019s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Discussions will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and the reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer\u2019s current report on Form 8-K dated today.","As we outlined in our earnings release, the IPO of 19.8% interest in Zoetis was completed on February 6 of this year. Thus effective February 7, the earnings attributable to the divested portion of Zoetis are excluded from adjusted and reported net income and diluted EPS, in both our first quarter results and our full year 2013 guidance. We still retain an 80.2% ownership interest, so all Zoetis revenues and expenses continue to be included in first quarter results as well as in the financial guidance for the full year.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you, Chuck. I will begin with some comments on the quarter. We started the year continuing to create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, we completed the successful IPO of a minority interest in Zoetis and related debt offering, and began returning those proceeds as well as the proceeds from the sale of our Nutrition business to our shareholders through share repurchases.","So far this year, we have repurchased approximately 6.3 billion of our shares. In addition, our focus on rebuilding and strengthening our innovative core is yielding results. During the quarter, we launched some significant products; most noteworthy were the launch of Eliquis in the U.S., UK, Germany, Denmark and Japan, and the launch of Xeljanz in the U.S. In addition, we recently approved approval for Xeljanz in Japan and Russia.","Regarding Eliquis, the market introduction since the launch is in line with our expectations. We continue to work with our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb on securing broader, commercial, medical and hospital reformery access. We expect to gain broader access as the year progresses as we seek to establish Eliquis as the leading novel oral anticoagulant in the market over time. We are very confident in Eliquis\u2019 clinical profile and our ability to translate that into a leading market position, given the new prescriptions we are seeing.","Regarding Xeljanz, we\u2019re encouraged by the early indications or indicators we\u2019re seeing with the U.S. launch. Describing where rheumatologist is tending higher and we are seeing that repeat prescribing is also tending higher, which suggests that once a physician prescribes to Xeljanz they generally increase prescribing. Importantly, we are seeing use in post-methotrexate and post-TNF patients at similar rates.","Our full promotional campaign launched in March and we plan to introduce DTC advertising this summer. In addition, we recently submitted the supplementary NDA for Xeljanz that was accepted for review by the FDA to include support of patient reported outcomes data in the label. Last week, we announced receiving a negative opinion for Xeljanz by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the EU.","In the opinion letter to Pfizer, CHMP noted that tofacitinib is a new chemical treatment with a different mechanism of action to products already approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and that in their opinion, the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib is not properly or sufficiently demonstrated. We disagree with their opinion and are seeking a reexamination. While history would show that reversal of such an opinion is not common, we feel compelled to further address the risk\/benefit issues raised by the rapporteurs through this process. We believe the risk-benefit profile of Xeljanz has been well characterized to date.","We have approximately 5,000 patients across Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in more than 40 countries resulting in 7,000 patient-years of exposure. The original application submitted to the EU was based on the same pivotal efficacy, the safety data package that was provided to regulatory agencies around the world, and that has resulted in approvals in the U.S., Japan, and Russia. This recent development in the EU does not change the status of Xeljanz as an approved treatment option in these markets. It is also under review in several additional countries and we anticipate decisions this year in a number of those markets.","Turning to our oncology business, we launched Bosulif in EU and saw good and improving performance from both Xalkori and Inlyta across the markets where these products have launched. Within our pipeline, we have shown steady improvement in the quality of compounds and in the right progress in advancing these compounds. Of particular note is the breakthrough therapy designation that the FDA recently granted to palbociclib, our innovative new investigational compound for patients suffering from breast cancer. Yesterday, we announced a worldwide collaboration agreement with Merck, except in Japan, for the development and commercialization of Ertugliflozin, our investigational compound for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Phase 3 trials are expected to begin this year, which will examine both its use as monotherapy and in  fixed-dose combinations.","We look forward to moving ahead with Merck in this area of significant unmet medical need, and we have a robust vaccines portfolio that includes a vaccine for meningitis B for adolescents and young adults that is currently in Phase 3.","Earlier in the pipeline, we are working on prophylactic vaccines to reduce the risk of some of the most difficult hospital acquired infections such as Staphylococcus aureus and C. difficile; our next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and therapeutic vaccines for smoking cessation and allergic respiratory diseases.","While we are seeing good momentum in our innovative core, our operating  environment continues to be challenging and at times volatile due to ongoing pricing and macroeconomic issues. This quarter, our emerging markets revenue grew 6% operationally. But we were negatively impacted by certain events that included the timing of certain government purchases of Enbrel and Prevnar franchise, and the transfer of  some of our products to a joint venture in China with Hisun Pharmaceuticals.","Let me note that we do expect the second half of the year will be stronger for our emerging markets business, and on a full-year basis, we continue to expect it will deliver high-single digit operational revenue growth. We also continue to demonstrate good fiscal discipline in managing our cost structure by continuing to align our costs with our  revenue base. This quarter, we reduced our total adjusted cost of sales, SI&A expenses, and R&D expenses by approximately 7% compared to a year ago.","Overall, I believe our results demonstrate our continued financial flexibility in adapting to our current operating environment. In a moment, Frank will provide you more details in the quarter and what we expect for the full year. Before he does that, I want to point out that we expect to see data from several important clinical trials during the second half of this year. This includes CAPiTA data of Prevnar 13, which if positive, may result in broader recommendations for adult usage following review by key vaccine technical committees like the ACIP.","We are also expecting data from two Phase 3 programs of dacomitinib  towards the end of this year. These programs involve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, whose disease has progressed after prior treatment. Full data presentations are planned for a medical conference next year, and we are expecting data from Phase 3 studies of Xeljanz for the treatment of psoriasis by mid year. If favorable, we expect to file early next year in the U.S. and Japan for the Xeljanz psoriasis indication. Separately, we also anticipate beginning a Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis study for Xeljanz later this year. Thank you, Geno.","As you can see, depending on our clinical outcome, Xeljanz has the potential to become a broad-based product franchise for our specialty care business. Also, later this year or early next, we\u2019ll see the complete Phase 2 data for palbociclib for the treatment of breast cancer and the associated assessment of progression-free survival and overall survival. We believe that palbociclib may represent an important potential treatment for this devastating disease given the encouraging data we\u2019ve already seen. And in February, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study evaluating palbociclib in combination with letrozole for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+\/HER2- advanced breast cancer. This represents 60% of cases amongst post postmenopausal patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.","Regarding our options relative to our 80% interest in Zoetis, we have not yet made a final determination. We are actively assessing the best options to maximize value for Pfizer shareholders in a speedy and an efficient manner.","As we shared with you the course of the last year, with the sale of the nutrition business and the successful IPO minority interest in Zoetis, we are building two strong businesses, innovative core and value core, each with the same cost structures and operating drivers. We know it will take the next few years to fully realize  the potential of each, and as each of these businesses progress, we will continue to evaluate how best to deliver their value to our shareholders.","In summary throughout this year, we will continue to stay focused on building a substantial innovative core, we will use our capital in ways to deliver the greatest value to our shareholders, we will continue to manage our cost structure, we will press forward on our initiatives  to help enhance our reputation with society, and we will focus on creating an ownership culture that helps to drive results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thank you Ian, and good day everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are  included in our webcast. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that adjusted and reported net income and diluted EPS in both our first quarter 2013 results and our updated 2013 guidance reflect the IPO of 19.8% interest in Zoetis, which we completed on February 6, 2013.","We still retain an 80.2% ownership interest, so all Zoetis revenues and expenses continue to be included in our first quarter results and in financial guidance for the full year. However, effective February 7, 2013 the earnings attributable to the divested portion of Zoetis are excluded from first quarter adjusted and reported net income and diluted EPS in both our first quarter results and our full year 2013 guidance.","Now let\u2019s move on to the financials. First quarter 2013 revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, decreased 9% year-over-year, reflecting a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 8% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, notably Lipitor in developed Europe during the second quarter of 2012 and Geodon in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2012, the timing of government purchases of Enbrel and the Prevnar  franchise in certain emerging markets and of Prevnar 13 in the U.S., and the transfer of certain product rights to our joint venture in China with Hisun.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.54, decreased 5% primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues, which was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 7% in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses, primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted-average shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program.","I want to point out that our solid performance during the first quarter was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.02 per share, due to changes in foreign exchange rates versus the US dollar, including the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, since we first provided our full year financial guidance in late January.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.38, compared with $0.24 in the year ago quarter and was favorably impacted by lower overall cost and lower certain other items, including non-acquisition related restructuring costs and fewer shares outstanding and unfavorably impacted primarily by the loss of exclusivity of certain products as well as other factors impacting revenues previously mentioned.","During the first quarter, biopharmaceutical volume growth of 10% in the BRIC-MT markets, it\u2019s primarily driven by strong growth in China and partially offset by price reductions of 1% to these markets resulting in operational revenue growth of 9%. If you exclude the product portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China, with Hisun, our operational revenue growth would have been 8% in our emerging markets business, 14% in BRIC-MT countries and 31% in China. In addition, foreign exchange negatively impacted BRIC-MT revenue by 1% in the first quarter 2013.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter revenues by 1% or $118 million and had a net positive impact of $24 million in the aggregate on adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared the year-ago quarter.","We\u2019re reducing our 2013 reported revenue guidance range by $900 million solely due, solely to reflect the non-operational negative impact of the changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar since mid-January, while most major currencies have worked against us since mid-January, approximately half of this unfavorable impact is attributable to the weakening of the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar.","I want to remind everyone that Japan is our second largest market and represented 10% of our total revenues in 2012. In addition, the evaluation of Venezuela and Bolivar accounts for approximately 20% of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange since mid-January.","Now, moving onto our 2013 financial guidance, I want to emphasize again that our guidance for this year reflects the completion of the IP over 19.8% interest to Zoetis and resulting non-controlling interest. Also add us full-year revenues and expenses are included in our guidance, but the earnings attributable to the 19.8% divested portion are excluded from both adjusted and reported diluted EPS guidance beginning on February 7, 2013.","As I just mentioned, we\u2019ve lower the upper and lower ends of our reported revenue guidance range by $900 million or approximately 1.6% due to foreign exchange movements, since in the January. We\u2019ve lowered our adjusted diluted EPS range from $2.20 to $2.30 to $2.14 to $2.24, to reflect the aforementioned changes in foreign exchange rates and the completion of the Zoetis IPO. And we\u2019ve lowered our reported diluted EPS range from $1.50 to $1.65 to $1.44 to $1.59, to reflect the same factors as well as some other offset factors.","Approximately $0.04 of this EPS decrease in adjusted and reported diluted EPS guidance ranges is due to the non-operational unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from mid January to mid April on our full year guidance, which includes the weakening of the Japanese yen and our [basket] of the currencies versus US dollar, but excludes the $0.02 negative impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which we are absorbing.","Approximately $0.02 of the decrease in the adjusted and diluted EPS guidance ranges is due to the elimination of the noncontrolling interest of Zoetis. To be clear, excluding in this $0.02 non-operational impact related to the noncontrolling interest of Zoetis, and foreign exchange rates remain constant, we would be reaffirming our initial full year 2013 revenue and reported and adjusted diluted EPS guidance.","Moving on to key takeaways, first quarter results were unfavorably impacted by the loss of exclusivity of several products and various geographies and the expected volatility in emerging markets. As we previously stated, because of this volatility, we anticipate our performance in that business to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. That said, we continue to expect high single-digit operational revenue growth in emerging markets in 2013 with the majority of this growth occurring in second half of the year.","We continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share repurchases. We received approximately $6 billion of proceeds from the successful completion of the IPO of 19.8% interest in Zoetis and a related debt offering. We\u2019ve updated our 2013 financial guidance to reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes since next January and the completion of the Zoetis IPO among other non-operational factors.","During the first quarter, we launched Xeljanz and Eliquis in the U.S., and Eliquis in several developed markets in the EU as well as in Japan. We remain excited about the potential of our mid-to-late stage pipeline and we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date, in 2013, we have repurchased approximately $6.3 billion or 227 million shares and we have approximately 5.5 billion of authorization remaining under the current repurchase program. I want to point out that since 2010; we have repurchased nearly 1.1 billion shares of our common stock. Finally, we remain committed as we\u2019re delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.","With that, I will turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano","Great. Thanks for your review Frank. With that, operator, can we please call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles E. Triano","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning everybody. Just two for you guys. First, Ian, you mentioned it\u2019s going to take several years for you to fully develop your innovative and value cores. As you consider how to best realize value from these divisions for your shareholders, should we think about the decision on that as something that could occur in the near term or do we really have to wait a couple of years to see how these businesses evolve before you have a better sense of the profiles of each.","My second question was on palbociclib, just thoughts on what breakthrough designation means here, the potential of file off of Phase 2 data, and can you talk a little about the early breast cancer opportunity, when we should expect to hear more about that? Thank you very much.","Ian Read","Okay. Thanks, Chris. I will deal with the two core businesses and then ask Geno to deal with the palbo question. I think what we\u2019re saying is that we believe there are two core businesses, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we look at this year as a year as the decision year on, how to structure those, how to indicate to you to give you further visibility and then simply the work involved in order to have those businesses as entities with enough financial information to make decisions when we are ready to make them would take two years to three years because of the complexity of separating out the businesses.","So, what we would like to do at some point in time and we\u2019ll take that decision this year is to start to operate more independently those businesses, give you more visibility as shareholders and then assess what are the advantages and disadvantages of having these two core businesses housed  in the same entity or not, and at that point, as we see that happen and frankly as we see the innovative core\u2019s pipeline mature and as we take steps to continue to strengthen value core\u2019s ability to have product growth inside certain segments of its product offering, that will inform our decision.","Geno Germano","Okay, so Chris just a couple of comments on palbociclib. I think you are probably familiar with the breakthrough designation now as this is a new device that the FDA has to increase or intensify their focus on programs where early clinical signals are compelling for conditions that are serious and life threatening, and certainly palbociclib falls into that category and it was encouraging to see FDA give the designation to palbociclib recently. So we look forward to continued engagement with the FDA on the program. As you know, the Phase 2 trial is still ongoing. We are anticipating completion around the end of this year or sometime in the second half. It is an event driven trial, so in a way, the longer that it takes, it\u2019s possible that patients are actually surviving longer and without progression in the palbociclib arm, which could be a very good thing.","So we are just going to have to wait until we achieve the required number of events and we\u2019ll report out as soon as we have results ready for disclosure. With regard to the early-stage trial, we are actually working on two additional Phase 3 trials now, one for earlier stage high risk patients as well as for advanced recurrent patients, and our expectation is that we\u2019ll initiate those trials in the second half of this year as well. So, we\u2019ll provide more color once we reach that point.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Geno. Operator next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you Frank, I have a question for you. I guess I\u2019m still very confused about something related to Zoetis IPO. Can you walk us through the dynamics of your 20% stake that you sold to the IPO and how the $6 billion in proceeds from that which were being allocated to share repurchases would not have allowed you to report accretion from your sale of Zoetis, instead you\u2019re reporting $0.02 of dilution, so I\u2019m just confused about that, I would just think with the IPO proceeds and given your market cap or rather your P\/E multiple that this would have been pretty meaningfully accretive.","And then secondly, can you talk about your current plans for the 80% Zoetis stake, I understand as Ian said that you haven\u2019t yet decided when or how, but if you could talk about maybe how you\u2019re thinking about allocating those proceeds as well? Thanks.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Okay. So on the first question, let me walk through this in a couple of steps, Jami. So, first on the last earnings call, I mentioned that our current year guidance, the 2013 guidance assumed mid teens in the billions share buybacks, so that was already factored into the guidance. That mid teens billions in buybacks made assumptions about the Nutri cash proceeds as well as the Animal Health IPO and debt offering proceeds, point one.","Point two; remember when we\u2019re buying back shares, we don\u2019t get the full year benefit of those shares from the EPS calculation in the year, it\u2019s a weighted--average calculation. So, the full year benefit of those buybacks will actually take place in 2014.","Point three, if we were to do something with the second step on Zoetis, and you assume that there was a share reduction from that, it would clearly be when you net it all out accretive, the reason you\u2019re seeing that $0.02 decrease in earnings today is simply a timing issue, it is the way that I think about it.","So hopefully that explains the steps relative to why you saw the $0.02, it\u2019s really timing, not getting the full year benefit of the shares, we repurchased this year and the fact that we had already planned for mid-teen billions in buybacks that -- which have taken into account Nutri in the first step on Animal Health.","In terms of current plans for Zoetis and our remaining 80.2%, couple of comments. First, we haven\u2019t made any decisions to date. Second, we have several alternatives available to us per the IRS ruling and we continue to monitor our market conditions. Third, there are no operational barriers that would prevent us from proceeding with a potential second step. And then lastly, our goal remains the same which is to maximize after-tax return to our shareholders.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Mike. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities","Yes, I was hoping you could talk about Xeljanz a little bit more and what\u2019s going on behind the scenes in the U.S. and the launch there and how its progressing and talk about the reimbursement that you have now and how that\u2019s going to change? And then second of all, on the oncology products that you have launched, Xalkori and Inlyta, if you could give us a little bit of an update there Geno on just how those are progressing and what kind of patients have been already penetrated and how much is left there? And then third, when is the staph vaccine trial is  going to readout? Thanks.","Ian Read","Okay. I will ask as you say, as you requested Geno to answer the Xeljanz and any oncology questions and Mikael can give you some update on the staph readout.","Geno Germano","So I guess for Xeljanz in the U.S. we\u2019re pretty pleased with the way things are going right now. We\u2019re seeing a continued adoption of the drug, fairly broadly now across rheumatology community. We have somewhere around 1,200, 1,300 physicians who have initiated patient trials and about two thirds of them are repeat prescribers, and we see this nice trend week after week after week increase in number of physicians with experience.","We know from our Phase 3 trials, with the patient reported outcomes and the efficacy that patients are likely to be very satisfied. We are already hearing from some rheumatologists that they\u2019re hearing back from their patients that their early experience has been very favorable, so I think it is a so far, so good situation as Ian mentioned in his opening comments, we really just kind of got off the tracks on our full launch in March with speaker programs, with sales representatives, with promotional materials in their hands, with additional medical support in the field; and in the middle of the summer, beginning of summer, we expect to launch our DTC.","So, we\u2019re right where we need to be, we see the trajectory of our launch comparing favorably to other recent launches. We\u2019re a little ahead of most of the other products that have launched in this category. So, again we like what we see.","With regard to reimbursement, initially we had, probably broader reimbursement support than we anticipated. Everyone just seem to agree to pass through reimbursement over the last couple of months, we\u2019ve seen more managed care players doing their full assessments and making decisions on formula replacement, we\u2019re getting the formula replacement, we would expect.","There will be prior authorization required for this medicine, just like there is for all of the medicines in the RA category and so, I think we have now formal reimbursement decisions made for lives, totaling about $60 million and continue there will be a continuation of evaluation by plants as we go into the summer.","So, again that\u2019s looking okay, and then finally, just to reiterate another point that Ian made in his comments, what we\u2019re seeing in terms of patients is we\u2019re seeing about an even split in patients that are post-methotrexate and patients who are post-TNF. So we\u2019re getting both second line and third line patients in the early experience so far. So that\u2019s that Xeljanz with regard to Xalkori and Inlyta, again we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. Inlyta in the first quarter, we did $63 million in the quarter. We\u2019re seeing real good uptake in second line, which is the indicated physician for that product for about 26% share in the second line.","In Europe, where we launched later last year, we know about half of the physicians now who treat patients with renal cell carcinoma have had experience with Inlyta, so the uptake there is on track. And in Japan, we\u2019ve had very robust uptake, it\u2019s actually the number one product to renal cell in Japan. So Inlyta is off to a good start, good feedback on patient tolerability, which is what we expected the benefit to be, so again so far so good there with Xalkori. We had a $53 million first quarter, up about 20% from the last quarter, which is again good progress.","Health testing continues to improve in the first quarter of this year; new guidelines were published for health testing. We think it will helpful in setting standards for who to test and how to get through the diagnostic in an expeditious manner. So we think that can have a benefit. And we\u2019re actually seeing now that we are getting healthier patients on Xalkori of good duration of therapy. So all the indicators are on track with Xalkori as well and make out handed over to Mikael to comment on (inaudible).","Mikael Dolsten","Marc, thank you for interest in our step always you like seeing. We are expecting data readout from our proof-of-concept study meter this year. It\u2019s really our first-in-class vaccine, which contains four components carefully select that to one hand, two of them and allow immune-mediated clearance of bacteria while the two others are selected to inhibit the growth of the bacteria including proprietary antigens that we have identified. The vaccine is designed to act on antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive stuff hours and we are quite enthusiastic about this potential new approach to deal with the threat of a difficult to treat stuff hours.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities","Thank you, Mikael","Ian Read","And Mark I\u2019ll just that Xeljanz sales in the quarter were $11 million. Then with that operator, we\u2019ll go to the next question.","Operator","Yes your next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Just thank a few, quickly on the Merck deal, should we view this as a step in the direction of Pfizer wanting to have a full fledged IBDs effort covering several classes of drugs or just weight of share cost and risk for one product area.","Secondly on capital deployment, your dividend yield is at the low-end of the major pharma average at this point certainly due to strong stock performance, but your payout ratio was also somewhat lower than average, I was curious if you add any updated thoughts on the balance between dividends, buybacks and business development or if not when can we expect an update?","And lastly in the pain area in light of the recent FDA actions on abuse-deterrent opioids, I was hoping you could update us on your current thinking on Remoxy in the ALO product in the oxycodone space as well as Embeda in the Morphine space. It seems like there is quite an opportunity there to cannibalize generics and generate a lot of revenue, if you can Embeda back on track, thanks.","Ian Read","Thanks, some of your questions are lot on you agenda. On the Merck deal, we have a large effort in CVMED; we continue to do research in diabetes and in areas around those conditions. I think this was a great opportunity for us to play there the product could not be as a backbone of monotherapy and we continue to remain focused on seeing some of the opportunities. John, do you want to add a little bit more on what you see at this partnership?","John Young","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Greg. And I think first thing to say is, we\u2019re really very excited about the opportunity of this collaboration with Merck to develop and commercialize ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin-containing fixed-dose combinations with metformin and JANUVIA.","It\u2019s a proprietary, innovative SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which as you know is a huge unmet clinical need and one that is growing. We expect to begin Phase 3 trials later in 2013 and we think that the clinical prolife in differentiating action has the potential to really complement the market leading therapeutic profile of JANUVIA brought to the collaboration by Merck.","So overall, we think as Ian said this is a very positive opportunity and one that really get the degree into point for the ongoing research efforts that we have in cardiovascular metabolic.","Maybe just to pick up on your question on pain and opioids as well, clearly it has been an interesting last few months with some of the decisions that the FDA have made which I think is really a recognition for some of the challenges that we have here in the United States with the abuse of opioids.","I think the decision along with the guidelines the agency issued in January really help to inform our development strategies. Specifically with Embeda as we said last quarter, the required stability programs are already underway.","We are working towards the submission of a prior approval supplement for Embeda in 2013 and we believe that Embeda subject to successful completion of those stability programs will be commercially available in the first half of 2014. For Remoxi, we had a predictive meeting with the FDA in March and the guidance that we\u2019ve got out about meeting, it certainly helping to inform the next steps and addressing the issues that the FDA had raised previously in their Complete Response Letter. We believe we have a path forward and we will publicly communicate further details overcoming quarters.","Ian Read","Thank you, John. Frank you want to take the total shareholder return\u2026","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Yeah, sure. So, Gregg let me run the numbers first and then I\u2019ll give you a little more color commentary. So the payout ratio for the quarter was 44%, right $0.24 on the dividend overnight over $0.54 or 44% payout ratio for Pfizer. If you look at what we\u2019ve done with the dividend since the acquisition of Wyeth, when we announce Wyeth, we cut the dividend from $1.28 to $0.64 since then we\u2019ve rated from $0.64 to $0.72, $0.72 to $80, $0.80 to $0.88 and $0.88 to $0.96 or 12.5%, 11%, 10% and 9% increases respectively, just in terms of running the numbers.","In terms of what we\u2019ll do going forward to dividend is on every year-end December, Ian and I make a recommendation to the Board of Directors and then once we get approval from the Board of Directors, we obviously announced that to on the investment community literally that day or the next day. So, that\u2019s the game plan for the dividend on a going forward basis.","In terms of just capital priorities, capital deployment priorities, from my prospective, they remain the same. So, first and foremost in terms of total shareholder return, we understand the importance of dividends and buybacks so that clearly remains the priority, investing in the business, whether that would be R&D programs, capital expenditures, launch cost associated with our new products, continued investment in the business, business development will be an area that we continue to look at, the amount of cash that we\u2019re paying to oversees.","So all the things that I\u2019ve talked about previously and I think what\u2019s important is, because of the amount of cash that we generate from operations, we have the ability to do all these things, which is really that\u2019s a nice structure to have so, that\u2019s all I answered the question.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Frank.","Charles E. Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well, thank you, couple of questions. You talked about Prevnar being week in Q1 due to timing that would imply. We should see a rebound in Q2 through Q4 such that on a full year basis will still see growth across the franchise, is that correctly of looking at it?","And then the second question relates to the mechanics of potentially splitting up the company further, you mentioned recently the one of the things that would be needed to do this is three years of audited financials. My question is whether that three year clock has started yet and if not is that mean that the earlier same thing it happened in terms of actually accomplishing the split would be 2016 or can you look back or satisfy some of the three year period versus it being forward-looking?","Ian Read","Tim, thank you. Well, so I just want to emphasize firstly that I believe we do have two operating models two core business in the company. The first order of business is define a model where we can separate them and give the management ability to run those businesses of this much authority and independence is necessary and to judge if those businesses inside Pfizer can fulfill what we believe is that full potential and where the shareholders see the potential as businesses and value them fully inside that combination.","If we decided or can be conclusion if they were further benefits from a split of those businesses, my decision has not been taken. I believe the earliest we could do that would be in 2016. And as I say, this year we\u2019re studying how best to report and how the results and how complicated it will be for us to start generating different P&Ls and even potentially balance sheets. So that is the situation where we are, and we will give you more color on when and how later on this year. With that I would turn it over to Geno for his comments.","Geno Germano","Yeah, Tim. Just on Prevnar, I think you actually \u2013 you have it right, I think our first quarter was impacted by some inventory differences compared to the first quarter last year primarily with the CDC purchases, some stockpile purchased last year in the first quarter, and even in the private market we saw slightly lower inventories in the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year, that will probably even out as we go through the year. Those decreases relative to last year offs that a little bit by some price increase that we had for this year in the U.S. in the first quarter, and a little bit of adult business that started to creep in.","So all-in-all, I think the business is stable in Europe; we were actually up about 3% for the first quarter reflecting a better pricing situation in the UK. And for emerging markets, rest of world, we\u2019re off again slightly in the first quarter of this year related to purchase timing primarily. The fundamentals of the business are very sound, the only NIP that we don\u2019t have this year that we had before is Morocco, it\u2019s about $9 million impact. So we\u2019re on pretty solid ground with Prevnar, I expect we will see strength as we go through the rest of the year.","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Geno. Our next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hi guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. On [drugs] if the appeal doesn\u2019t work out at the end of re-filing, what new data would you have that would allow a re-filing, and the second question is on PD-991, given the mechanism of action, I guess there is a reasonable, it\u2019s reasonable it may work across different tumor types, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen strong signals often, Michael outside of breast, and then just finally on the EM, you mentioned EM you thought growth would pick up in the second half and I was looking for little bit of color on that, why you think that\u2019s going to happen. Thank a lot.","Ian Read","Geno, if you could deal with the Xeljanz and then I\u2019ll Michael talk about Palbo and \u2026","Geno Germano","Yes","Ian Read","To talk about EM.","Geno Germano","So, Mark Xeljanz in Europe as we\u2019ve indicated we are going to go through a reexamination process, we hope to build to clarify some of the issues that were raised by CHMP and either eliminate the majority of them or some of them, so we can focus our follow up activities on the areas that our of most interest or concern to the CHMP. We would probably spend more effort analyzing and reanalyzing data that we have to complete a new filing.","We would have some additional data from our 1069 study, the two year data, which would be new and we could have updated safety tables from ongoing long term extension trails, as primarily the data that we will put into the filing, but I think it has more to do with going deeper into some of the areas that the CHMP has been asked about and I think we can do some of that with just stronger analysis of some of the databases that we\u2019ve already discussed.","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno. So, on Palbociclib and Mark we appreciate your interest in how this drug could be fully developed. Yes, certainly we are exploring opportunities in a number of different tumor segments and we have pre-clinical and some early clinical signs that this mechanism can have an important outcome also in other tumors. We are starting now or thinking on starting of course the number of segment from melanoma to squamous cell carcinoma in a variety of different locations, which can include head-to-head neckline esophageal tumors.","I would like to underline that given the strengths of palbociclib in ER positive breast cancer, and amount of understanding we have got on the importance of this drag in breast cancer, as Geno outlined this year, we are starting three different breast cancer trials, advance ER positive breast early breast cancer that are ER positive and recoverant, but in addition to that there are more segments in the ER positives that we are considering as opportunities which can include medium to low risk ER positive breast. And also within the \u2013 our two segments, substantial proportion also carry the ER positive signature.","So Mark even the very strong signal in breast its compelling to consider that the breast cancer ER positive is segment alone, obviously have potential to make this one of the most impact full drugs. In addition to exploring other tumors as you asked for.","Okay Mark coming to emerging markets, you\u2019ve heard Ian and Frank talking about the one-time event of government purchase of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar in Mexico and some countries in Africa and Middle East. Those had significant impact on the growth for the quarter and taking those events out underlying growth is more like 10% for OEM and some seeing around 14% for BRIC-MT countries. So the reason why we are expecting a better second half in term of growth rate is due to the fact that we still expecting to get the full year purchase order of those medicine and I\u2019m talking NIP Prevnar and Enbrel but the timing would be pushed for the second half of the year.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you, Olivier.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay. I have a few questions. What was the rationale for designing CAPiTA without a comparison arm with Pneumovax? And without such comparison, do you believe you can still get an ACIP approval? Secondly does the ongoing Phase 3 Palbo trial have an interim look built in and if so when would we get that data? And then thirdly on Xeljanz, I appreciate it is early days but of the 11 million in Q1, how much of that was pipeline stocking? Thank you.","Ian Read","Okay. Geno, would you like to take all three, I mean the CAPiTA trial design, the Palbo and those?","Geno Germano","Yeah. So I mean the CAPiTA trial design was obviously discussed with regulators. This is a post marketing commitment for the accelerated review in the United States, so this is a trial design that has been thoroughly discussed and agreed upon with the FDA and the decision to not include Pneumovax \u2013 as competitor I think was related to the fact that there is lack of evidence that there is a Pneumovax effect on Community Acquired Pneumonia, but essentially it was an agreed upon protocol with the regulators.","We do believe that with positive data that we will be able to demonstrate reach agreement on a favorable recommendation from ACIP. So with the Palbociclib Phase 3 trial, there is a provision for an interim look, I don\u2019t know what the timing on that is, so I can\u2019t give you a date, we\u2019ll have to follow-up with you, Steve on that.","And with Xeljanz of the $11 million almost none of it is pipeline stocking, we put very small amount of product in the marketplace at the end of last year, because of the class and the specialty pharmacy management of a drug like this there are not large inventories out there.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thank you, Geno.","Charles E. Triano","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Baum of Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","Good morning. Three questions please. Firstly on Palbociclib, you mentioned there were current breast cancer trial you are running to understand the trial design, you\u2019re looking at adding the drug on top of AFINITOR or looking at in head-to-head design? Second, are you looking at the development of Palbociclib, we have combination chemotherapy in select rheumatoid using the drug of chemo protections, which an idea has been suggested by some? And then finally on Xeljanz, just outline the [repeater and co-repeater] and whether the possibility exists that became individual up and central approval if you do in fact receive the rejection from your ongoing appeal?","Ian Read","Thank you, Andrew. I\u2019ll ask Mikael to answer the Palbo questions and in fact Geno could talk a bit about the Xeljanz and the European Union.","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, so concerning Palbo our Phase 2 study was on top of letrozole and [aromatizing] EBITDA. We do think that the unique opportunity with Palbociclib is to a large extent to delay the need or replace the need for chemotherapy with all its burden on patients. So our treatment designs for the advanced and recurrent involves the use of additional full moon blockade beyond letrozole, and particular for the recurrent, we are keen on the opportunity to add a drag on top of fulvestrant, which you may know has been used and demonstrated to be an agent that can have some intrinsic activity even off the human receptor blockade is diminished by receptor antagonist by having additional receptor degradation of the insulin pathway. But we haven\u2019t excluded opportunity for a certain chemo-combinations, but we are even more enthusiastic about the ability to give profound treatment effect without the serious side-effect of chemo treatment.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","Great. Thank you very much, Geno?","Geno Germano","Okay. Andrew, I think your question was related to the opportunity or the potential to go forward with individual country registrations versus the central approach in the event that we\u2019re not successful with the reevaluation. I mean suddenly, there is an opportunity to explore that option, but we\u2019re not at a point yet, we\u2019re prepared to make that decision.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","Thank you, Geno.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Geno. Next question, please operator?","Operator","The next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, thank you. I have a couple of questions, please. First, with respect to separating established products, could you just explain to us some of the operational changes that you\u2019re making for example, I think you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you\u2019re moving some lines of manufacturing to different parts of facilities. But if you could go into some more detail on operationally what action is being taken that would be helpful?","And second with respect to the possibility of exiting the business, I\u2019m just curious about whether you need the three years of financials to be able to do a tax free spin off and that is why you are looking at a three year timeline or whether you could exit the business sooner through a simple sale of the business or would that just be too difficult from a tax standpoint to exit the segment through a sale prior to having three years of audited financials? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you. Well, on separating the business, we already have separated the management in U.S. and developed markets. The key question that we are looking at is in our BRIC-MT and our emerging markets that are very successful in growing aggressively, what would we need to do to separate out and what will be the dynamics of that of separating out and what portfolio we separate out so as to create an innovative core and a value core and how would we allocate capabilities and access within that, this is not a tribune undertaking in an organization that\u2019s already performing so well.","And the second part would be clearly on the manufacturing side, we would want to try and identify plants that are purely of a value or established product type plants and there have to be independencies and you look at that and then you also have to look at the tax issues as you do that. So this is we believe worth doing, I believe it is worth creating that separation internally because I think it brings focus and management focus and will improve the performance of those two businesses.","But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing carefully given the \u2013 it\u2019s sort of reorganization of our potential reorganization of emerging markets that is being so successful as is. But certainly that\u2019s some of the consideration as we go to look at this separation now. I\u2019ll ask Frank to talk about the timing and the mechanics of that, but I would just add that under your hypothetic scenario of a buyer, I\u2019m sure the buyer would want to see P&Ls and balance sheets.","Unidentified Company Representative","And Dave I think what I\u2019ll add to what Ian said is, when we talk about the three years, it\u2019s really, I\u2019ll call it a path that\u2019s similar to what we did \u2013 if we would do it, a path that\u2019s similar like the (inaudible) path, where basically it\u2019s a path that we are doing it ourselves and we set ourselves up in a position to be able to do whatever kind of optionality we want on a standalone basis. But that\u2019s what we think about when we talk about the three years.","Ian Read","So the underlying thesis of this is that we have an innovative call, which is focused on science and focused on selling and delivering education in a certain way and would have an exciting pipeline that would drive substantial growth and certain shareholders would have an appeal for that type of investment. And then we would have a value company, which has a substantial and cash flows, large dividend capacity, big brands in emerging markets more of a sort of traditional selling model, also with brand generics. But also we want to take time as we go through the next couple of years to see how we strengthen both of those segments. We are strengthening [cumulative] call with the pipeline. We also want to look on how do we strengthen the value business at the same time. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","All right, thanks very much. So just wanted to check on BD, historically you\u2019ve discussed primarily tuck-in acquisitions, Frank. May be you can just give us, reiterate the thresholds or give us the thresholds that you are thinking about on that regard. Also historically, you\u2019ve talked about interest in the sterile injectable space as a potential area of interest. Can you just update us on that as well? And then lastly on psoriasis and the indication for potential indication for Xeljanz, can you just give us a sense of the dose used in the oral studies as well as the percept of the topical formulation. And I\u2019m more asking that in the context of safety questions that have been raised at least by the CHMP. Thanks very much.","Ian Read","Geno, could you answer the psoriasis question?","Geno Germano","Yeah. So for the psoriasis program, our Phase 2 trial, we used five milligram to 15 milligram dose and I think those results have been disclosed. In the Phase 3, we have the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses both administered BID. And again you\u2019ll be seeing readouts in the middle of this year on those trials. We are now working on a topical formulation and intent to initiate a Phase 2 trial with the topical formulation this year.","Ian Read","Okay on BD, I just like to preface a few comments and make some comments and pass over to Frank. Our view on BD has always been that it\u2019s not a strategy, it\u2019s an enabler and we will do BD if we see a clear path of increasing shareholder value. So we\u2019ve always said never say never to big deals and we\u2019ve said we\u2019re looking at bolt-on deals or frankly any deal where we felt that there was a convincing argument that we would add value to our shareholders. So Frank do you want to make some more color on there.","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Yeah. I think what I would say is just to punctuate Ian\u2019s comments is from my perspective as of we never say never, the strategy remains bolt-on acquisitions and we say the thresholds and my mind target areas are our priority therapeutic areas, so inflammation and immunology, pain oncology, CVMED, neuroscience, emerging markets you seen us do take actions in the emerging markets more on a local basis, when you see what we\u2019ve done there and then established products which by the way comprises a major part of our emerging markets business and that includes things like reformulations for example which was Quillivant transaction with NextWave. So those have been the strategies, those continue to be the strategies and always with the focus being how we create shareholder value. Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First the question for Frank in cost cutting, I think last year you characterize as being in the middle and I was wondering if you could update us on let us know which anywhere now and then a follow-up on for Geno, could you talk about your sampling strategy and would you characterize it as aggressive and could that perhaps time consuming little bit and when you expect those patients to come back to the physicians to perhaps get prescription, thank you.","Ian Read","Frank?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","So last year, I did say earnings if you look at what we saved operational last year in terms of our total cost and expense base, it was almost $4 billion in operational savings, I think the exact number is about $3.8 billion and I think it was clearly entered via the late innings, entering the seventh inning right now. Still opportunities to further reduce cost; I think you saw that again this quarter. Adjusted costs and expenses were down operationally $545 million, 7%. But I think when you look at kind of the continuum, the rhythm, I think we\u2019ve entered, just started entering the late innings.","Geno Germano","Yeah. So, Alex the program that we\u2019ve put out there for Xeljanz, there were two sampling programs, one of the 14 day sample, it\u2019s primarily managed through our patients support program to help patients get started on therapy right away while they\u2019re going through the prior authorization process. So, that\u2019s a 14 day relatively short-term program. And then we gave select physicians a series of 28 day patient starters, so again they could get some early experience. It\u2019s very difficult for us to track the utilization of those samples so it\u2019s difficult for me to say whether or not, I think that\u2019s influencing the uptake. And I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ll call it aggressive, I think we were somewhat pointed in a way that we distributed those samples and so, we\u2019ll see how things play-out.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks Geno. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Anthony Butler of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Anthony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks very much. Just briefly one question on our two parts to Eliquis and one is around overall spend there is, do you feel or otherwise it\u2019s an early launch that the overall spend so far has been as you predicted sufficient for the initial launch and the second issue is assuming the six month mTOR on DTC is over do you anticipate a direct-to-consumer campaign much like occurs with rivaroxaban thank you very much.","Geno Germano","Thank you, Anthony. John?","John Young","Okay. Thanks for the question Anthony. So I think the first point to make is that you along with our partners, BMS we\u2019ve been very thoughtful by making sure of you. We are very focused on our investment, but we are also mindful of the very competitive nature of this market and resourcing, what we remain convinced is actually a really significant opportunity to improve the outcomes for patients with the indications that we\u2019ve researched thus far. So, we\u2019ve deployed our resources, have made sure that we are competitive and in addition to just this year spend; I think the other thing that both companies bring is obviously a strong heritage in cardiovascular medicine between Pfizer and BMS, which we believe is a real positive advantage for us in the marketplace.","And our expectations for Eliquis are broadly in line with launches in, mentioned in his opening comments. We always have known this was going to be an opportunity that was going to require us to displace a competitor in warfarin that\u2019s been in the marketplace for 50 years. But we are very positive about the progress that we\u2019ve made thus far and certainly what we have seen is a trend in the marketplace that has Eliquis pretty much on track to actually the second (inaudible).","In terms of DTC specifically, you are absolutely right, we currently are still in that six month moratorium period, which certainly is an alliance we would \u2013 once we have come out of that moratorium period, subject purposely see clearance by OPBP and the FDA, we would certainly have plans to initiate a DTC campaign in the U.S. to enable us to communicate the benefit risk of Eliquis to the patients and we are very positive about that as being a further opportunity that will kick in the second half of the year.","Anthony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks John. Next question please","Operator","You next question is from Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Joe, my questions have been answered. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano","Next question operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Tong of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Michael Tong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Just one quick question, on the R&D side, if I look at Inlyta and Xalkori, nice to see the ramp coming up but in the overall scheme of things still a relatively modest contributor to the top line. So maybe for Frank or Mike, as you think about capital allocation within the R&D segment where you\u2019re allocating your R&D dollars maybe perhaps give us an idea of how you splitting between primary care and specialty care at the moment and where you think it might be in two or three years time?","Frank D\u2019Amelio","Thanks for question. We have TAs we\u2019ve broadly stated that we are spending on which is oncology and vaccines, and inflammation and immunology, CVMed oncology pain and that\u2019s where we are dividing our spend and we\u2019re dividing it as we see opportunities that occur in the science. I personally I am excited about what we see coming at our oncology portfolio. And I think they have the potential to be a large driver on our revenue go forward, as does the vaccine segment where we are investing in which we really basically we start investing from a standing star after acquiring Wyeth. They had one large and good vaccine, but since then we\u2019re really building up a portfolio of vaccines. So in fact Mikael may just want to comment briefly on the more interesting oncology projects.","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, so overall oncology is our largest investment in R&D slightly above 20% of the R&D investment followed by immunology inflammation just slightly below that. And then number of the other core areas are somewhere between 10% to 20% and we try to do capital allocation by looking at what\u2019s in the pipeline, what is looking most promising, and where we\u2019ll see a return of investment going forward.","So it\u2019s certainly not carving stone, but as we do across the business in R&D allocation to maximize output. Particularly in oncology, we have opted a successful launch of three products in recent one to two years. We now have a second wave that we\u2019re very excited about.","On one end, Dacomitinib, that with the end rate data within the next period of this year, early next year in Rituximab for blood cancer, and of course Palbociclib, that we spoke a lot about it today. But behind that we have other interesting oncology drugs, such as (inaudible) for multiple blood cancers, and PI3K\/mTOR that will have a readout over the next couple of years in several solid tumors. So it\u2019s quite a rich portfolio in oncology, immunology, vaccines and across the biotherapeutic areas.","Michael Tong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles Triano","Thanks, Mikael. If we could take our last question please, operator?","Operator","Yes, your final question comes from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on the strategic deployment of capital to research and development. And the pipeline has shown a lot of strength and productivity over the years, a lot of that strength is coming from the R&D spend, where the spend was much higher. As you look forward, are you comfortable with around 12% of sales going to R&D and keeping this high productivity going \u2013 to keep it going over the long-term? Thank you.","Geno Germano","Thank you for the question. Yeah we are very confident about capital allocation. We feel we have the right balance allocated to research right now. And it obviously depends upon opportunities to come in the pipeline; if large opportunities come that look very promising and requires substantially more resources and we would not shrink from putting those resources there, assuming we believe in the opportunities.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter 2011 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Primary Care; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel, President and General Manager of Pfizer Nutrition; and David Simmons, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products. ","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage, pfizer.com, by clicking on the link Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2011 located in the Investor Presentation section in the lower right-hand corner of this page. ","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Also the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 31, 2012. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap some highlights from the fourth quarter and for the year, and I'll talk about what we are focusing on for 2012. ","We finished 2011 with a solid fourth quarter and the overall financial performance for the year was strong. ","Looking at the quarter, losses of exclusivity continued to impact our business. This quarter, we absorbed nearly $1.3 billion revenue decline due to losses of exclusivity across our Biopharmaceutical commercial units. We saw strong operational growth in key markets such as Japan and China. Revenues in the Emerging Market business overall declined 2% operationally due to pricing pressures and exceptional items that Frank will review in more detail. ","As we have said before, the opportunity in Emerging Markets remains attractive, although quarter-to-quarter performance is volatile. I believe the best measure of our business in these markets is the yearly performance, which I will speak to in a moment. ","Animal Health, Nutrition and Consumer all turned in strong quarters operationally. Animal Health grew 13%, Nutrition grew 20% and Consumer grew 8% over the same quarter in 2010. And we saw the benefits of our process improvements and cost reduction work this quarter.  Adjusted total costs were down 5% operationally. ","Turning now to highlights for the year. We met or exceeded every aspect of our financial guidance. We reduced our adjusted R&D spend by nearly $1 billion compared to 2010, but we also took significant actions to strengthen our innovative core, which included: narrowing our therapeutic areas of focus; sharpening our analytical tools to better prioritize investment and stop funding low-potential programs earlier in the R&D cycle; advancing the most promising compounds within our pipeline; and continuing to invest in R&D network and the capability design to drive biomedical innovation. ","During the year, the Emerging Markets business was affected by strong headwinds such as: increased pricing pressure in China and Turkey, the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Brazil and Mexico in 2010 and devaluation of Venezuela. That being said, revenue in Emerging Markets grew 5% operationally in 2011, comprised of 10% volume growth and a 5% decline in price. Performance was particularly strong in key markets where we increased our investment, such as China, which delivered 18% operational revenue growth, and Turkey, which delivered 17% operational growth for 2011. ","We grew revenues from key assets in our branded portfolio including Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Enbrel and Sutent. We absorbed approximately $5 billion in LOE and operationally, only saw a slight decline in our revenues year-over-year. ","We moved quickly to complete a strategic review of the businesses, which resulted in the ongoing expiration of strategic alternatives for the Animal Health and Nutrition business. ","We saw a steady cadence of progress in our late-stage pipeline and the emergence of a promising mix of early- to mid-stage assets. And we returned over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ","I would characterize 2011 as a year of committing the company to being a focused, innovative biopharmaceutical company positioned to deliver value for shareholders. We set a course to redefine and strengthen Pfizer. We concentrated on 2 key priorities: improving the performance of our innovative core and making the right capital allocation decisions. And I believe we delivered on both of these goals. ","Turning to this year, our focus is unchanged. We remain intent on continuing to take the actions that will create shareholder value. And like we did in 2011, we will continue to do so in 2 primary ways: getting our innovative core more productive and sustainable and keeping our allocation priorities in line with the best interests of shareholders. ","The way we will do this is by: maximizing the value of our in-line portfolio, including key in-line assets such as Lyrica, Enbrel, Prevnar and Celebrex; successfully launching Inlyta and Prevnar 13 for adult 50 years and older; advancing the regulatory filings for Eliquis and tofacitinib; and advancing the next wave of compounds in our pipeline, including new molecular entities that are showing promise and that we hope will achieve proof of concepts over the next 2 years. I believe the recent approval of Inlyta as well as the early performances of Xalkori in the U.S. demonstrates how well our Oncology business is evolving. ","Regarding Prevnar 13 Adult. The ACIP pneumococcal working group plans to discuss the use of Prevnar 13 in adults with the ACIP Committee at the upcoming meeting in February. Although a vote on recommendation of use is not currently scheduled, we are in discussions with the CDC to obtain guidance about the use of Prevnar 13 and will launch the adult indication in the U.S. in March. The rate of uptake will depend in large part on the ACIP recommendation for use. ","Also in 2012, we continue to strengthen our Emerging Markets business and maintain a leadership role as we see growth over time in key markets like China, Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey and Mexico. We will keep examining our cost structure including all aspects of our SI&A, our go-to-market expenses and manufacturing so that we can maintain a lower and flexible cost base that allows us to respond to pricing pressures and additional LOEs over the coming years. ","We're on track for determining the strategic alternatives and next steps for the potential separation of our Animal Health and Nutrition business. We still plan to announce our strategic decision for each business in 2012. ","And we will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to meeting a target dividend payout of approximately 40% by the end of 2013. Further, our board recently approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program and we've stated our intent to purchase approximately $5 billion during this year.  This amount does not include any repurchases that could result from actions taken related to our Nutrition and Animal Health business. ","To sum up, in 2012, we will stay the course. We will work to maintain the momentum we created in 2011. Longer term, after we potentially complete the separation of Animal Health and Nutritional, Pfizer will be a company that has 2 primary businesses with distinct cost structures and operating approaches. The first will be a growth business of pharmaceuticals that we expect to generate profitable revenue growth with strong cash flow and that has a sustainable innovation engine that will be evident through advances in our pipeline. The second will look more like a value business that is also expected to generate strong cash flow and will be represented by established or post-LOE products. We can see -- we see Consumer Products fitting nicely into either of these businesses. I see these businesses generating consistent and steady growth in earnings per share over time. ","Now I will turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2012 financial guidance.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now let's move on to the results. ","Fourth quarter 2011 revenues of $16.7 billion decreased 4% year-over-year reflecting the continued impact of LOEs of approximately $1.3 billion or 7% and the unfavorable impact of U.S. healthcare reform of $106 million or 1%, which were partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange of $157 million or approximately 1%, the addition of King products, which favorably impacted revenues by $340 million or 3%, and growth in certain in-line products. ","Reported net income of $1.4 billion and reported diluted EPS of $0.19 were negatively impacted by the impact of LOEs, the nonrecurrence of a onetime tax benefit recorded in 2010 and higher charges associated with our cost reduction and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by lower acquisition-related cost and the nonrecurrence of current -- of certain litigation charges recorded in 2010. ","Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 20.1% versus 21.1% in the year-ago quarter due primarily to the positive impact of foreign exchange and our cost reduction and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by the addition of legacy King operations, the Puerto Rico excise tax and a shift in geographic and business mix. ","Adjusted total cost decreased 9%, reflecting the positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted total cost decreased 5% operationally, which also reflects the positive impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, particularly in the R&D organization, and the negative impact of the addition of costs from legacy King operations, the U.S. healthcare reform fee and the Puerto Rico excise tax. ","Adjusted income of $3.9 billion increased 3% year-over-year, driven by lower adjusted total cost and foreign exchange, which were partially offset by the impact of LOEs and a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. ","Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 6%, which included a $0.02 benefit from share repurchases as well as the positive items I just mentioned. Foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter revenues by $157 million or 1% and lowered adjusted total cost by $481 million or 4%. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06. ","As I mentioned earlier, this quarter we continued to absorb revenue declines as a result of the loss of exclusivity of certain products in several geographies. The fourth quarter negative impact of LOEs was approximately $1.3 billion. The full year negative impact was approximately $5 billion. This quarter, the impact of LOEs was partially offset by the addition of King products, growth in our Animal Health, Nutrition and Consumer Healthcare businesses, the positive impact of foreign exchange and growth of certain in-line pharmaceutical products including Lyrica, Enbrel, Celebrex and Sutent, Prevnar 7 in Japan and Prevnar 13, Norvasc and Viagra in Emerging Markets with overall double-digit growth in China. ","Fourth quarter revenues generated from both our Biopharmaceutical and our other businesses in Emerging Markets increased to $3.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, Biopharmaceutical revenues in Emerging Markets declined 2% operationally. Although that business experienced volume growth of 3%, this was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange, 2%, increased pricing pressures, changes in institutional purchase patterns in Turkey and Brazil, currency devaluation in Venezuela and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Brazil and Mexico, 2010. ","It's important to note that for the full year 2011, Biopharmaceutical revenues in all emerging markets grew 5% operationally, which reflects operational growth of 10% and price reductions of 5%. Biopharmaceutical revenues increased 6% operationally to about $4.2 billion in the BRIC-MT markets in 2011. ","As you can see, in 2011 we again met or exceeded all elements of our full year financial guidance, including achieving our cost-reduction target associated with the Wyeth acquisition 1 year ahead of plan, generating more than $4 billion of cost reductions on an operational basis compared with the 2008 combined cost of Pfizer and Wyeth. ","Looking ahead to 2012. We're updating some elements of our full year financial guidance and providing a guidance range for adjusted cost of sales for the first time. Specifically, we have reduced the guidance ranges for reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS primarily to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies from mid-October of 2011 to mid-January 2012. We now expect 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $60.5 billion to $62.5 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. In addition, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.52. We've lowered the guidance range for adjusted SI&A to $17 billion to $18 billion, and we expect adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. ","So finally, moving on to key takeaways. I'm very pleased that this year, we again met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance including achieving the cost-reduction target associated with the Wyeth acquisition ahead of schedule. We've updated certain components of our 2012 guidance primarily to reflect the significant unfavorable changes in currency rates from mid-October of 2011 to mid-January of 2012. We remain on track to finalize strategic decisions for our Animal Health and Nutrition businesses in 2012 and continue to expect that any separation of these businesses from Pfizer will occur between July of 2012 and July of 2013. ","In 2011, we returned $15.2 billion to shareholders through $6.2 billion in dividends and $9 billion in share repurchases, and we remain committed to allocating our capital in order to deliver attractive shareholder returns in 2012 and beyond. ","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano","Thanks, Frank. And at this point, operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Catherine Arnold from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I don't have to tell you guys that getting your share count down is going to make a big difference in the way people look at your pipeline, your product story and fueling growth. I know you know that. But obviously, there can be big swings in what people expect from you in the longer-term EPS based on what you do there. And I guess I -- there's a lot of questions about the various scenarios of how you use the proceeds from Nutrition and Animal Health towards buying back shares. And I guess I'm wondering, are you thinking about giving us any new guidance on share repurchase once you announce these transactions? Or is this something that we're going to have to monitor? And are you thinking about the proceeds from these transactions as earmarked in any different way than the way you're sort of giving us your strategy from the year-to-year cash flow that you generate?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Catherine. Let me start, and then Frank can add to it. There's been no change in our strategy from 2011 to 2012. We've said that the use of our cash post dividends, post investment of the business will be -- stock buybacks is the first test. And we remain aligned with that. So once we complete -- if we complete the separation of Nutritional and Animal Health, then the funds from that will be tested against the best investment with stock buyback being the baseline. Frank, do you want to add to that?","Frank A. D'Amelio","I'd just punctuate what Ian said, Catherine, which is the proceeds from those businesses, assuming we do a separation, the case to beat is buybacks. That's what we've said, that's what we continue to say and that's what we will do relative to anything with those businesses. And let me just run a couple of numbers, which is if you look last year, Ian and I mentioned we returned $15 billion to shareholders. Of that, $9 billion were buybacks. We bought back 459 million shares with that $9 billion. And we've said this year, approximately $5 billion in buybacks plus another $6-plus billion in dividends, $11-plus billion for the year. In the last 2 years, we have returned $26 billion, what we were estimating this year plus what we did last year in capital directly to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ian, I've got a couple of questions. The first is, is that I appreciate your providing us your vision for what Pfizer might look like post-2012 in terms of 2 different companies, an innovative core and a cash generator and the commitment to grow the company on a consistent basis. Can you provide a little bit more color behind that in terms of how we should think about the revenue outlook? I mean, obviously post Lipitor, there's still other patent expirations, obviously divesting about $6.5 billion to $7 billion worth of companies. And then on the bottom line, what that could look like. So if you could be just a little bit more specific on your top and bottom line growth aspirations post 2012. And my second question is more to do with just your view of the reshaping of Pfizer's portfolio. A lot of the discussion last year focused on what that portfolio might look like. And your goal was to achieve a smaller, more focused company. And when I step back, I'm still looking at a $60 billion company, which is huge. And I'm wondering if you have discovered through the process of being CEO, other options that might now be on the table that weren't earlier in the year that could lead to a further reshaping of the portfolio.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Jami, for those 2 questions. So I think, if you -- I tried to lay it out by saying I look at the company in 2 parts. So clearly, with the post Lipitor, we've got through the bulk of the LOEs, but still continue to have sequential LOEs through 2015. So I tend to look on the top line in 2 companies. One, where if we take it as the innovative core and we see the growth coming from that, that in my mind is a growth company that's sustainable with a research engine that's sized and will be predictable. And then I look at a value company that will have to absorb the post-LOE impact of the transfers. And then from that base, we'll be stable or grow, given it'll have Emerging Market growth, et cetera, et cetera. So top line growth will be the impact of those 2 factors. And I'm more focused on our ability to produce predictable and consistent EPS growth over time as we manage those 2 businesses. Now to your second question, I feel that while we are a $60-plus billion business, that's prior to any decisions on the separation of Nutritionals and Animal Health. And then laying out this clear vision of 2 businesses, I think leads to increased visibility, 2 business models, different cost structures, different priorities. And I think it'll allow the Street to clearly see the value of those 2 businesses inside of Pfizer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On your 2012 guidance, you said it was lower -- revenues and earnings were lower primarily due to FX. Were there any other contributing factors? And then second, Lilly's Q4 call was dominated by questions about solanezumab. And your product, bapineuzumab is going to have important data in the current year as well, yet you never seem to talk about it too much. I'm hoping I can kind of ask you a few questions on this. The first is what will be the timing and venue for seeing the results of the 2 U.S. trials? The second is can you confirm that you'll likely present the results of both trials at the same time like Lilly will do? And then the third point, have there been futility analyses done with the bapi Phase III trials?","Ian C. Read","So Frank, perhaps you can address the first question, and then I would ask Olivier to answer the question on bapineuzumab.","Frank A. D'Amelio","Yes, so 2012 guidance. If you look at -- we'll start with the bottom line. If you look at what the previous bottom line was and now with the current one is for adjusted diluted EPS, it went from $2.25 to $2.35, to $2.20 to $2.30. That $0.05 is entirely due to foreign exchange. If you look at revenue, revenue went from $62.2 billion to $64.7 billion to $60.5 billion to $62.5 billion. So on average, if you look at the bottom of the range and the top of the range, we lowered the 2012 revenue number by about $2 billion. Roughly 2\/3 of that, approximately 2\/3 of, that was due to foreign exchange. The other 1\/3 was really due to, I'll call it, 3 areas. One was a more challenging environment in the EU. Second one was more generic product offerings by ourselves in certain emerging markets. And the third was lower-than-expected volume growth in Emerging Markets due to accelerated price cuts. That said, we still see robust growth opportunities in those markets and the volume is less than we expected.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Frank. Yes, re-emphasizing that, it's just -- we -- as price cuts occur in Emerging Markets, we expect volume to respond. In '11, we saw the response slightly slower than had we expected in our original projections and we corrected for that in '12. Olivier?","Olivier Brandicourt","All right. In term of timing, it's the same timing that we talked about in the previous calls. And the studies are going to be read out by mid-year, and we will report the results as soon as possible afterwards in a scientific meeting. There was no futility analysis done on those studies. And I would like to actually mention that the 2 products or the 2 compounds are targeting a different epitope on the beta and amyloid peptides. And that may trigger 2 very different mechanism of actions. And therefore, the results of one may not be transferable to the results of the other one. However, I must say that based on what we heard this morning, we heard the alliance views the decision to continue on solanezumab with interest. And we're maintaining confidence in the amyloid pathway for our AD program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from BoA Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, for Ian and Frank, given that we're actually getting closer to seeing proceeds, I want to better understand the buyback being the case to beat comment you've been making. So buyback offers immediate accretion, while good acquisitions often take a few years to generate a return. So how are you truly comparing the 2? Is it an accretion in an out-year or something like that? And then for Dave Simmons, what have been the key positives and negatives learned from your Lipitor strategy and how that might shape future strategy for generic launches?","Ian C. Read","Okay. On the buybacks, I mean, I -- I think it's clear that we look at the value of the share in the market today. And we have models to look at the value of the share on a discounted cash flow basis, so we look on that return on a buyback along with the impact of dividend payments being lowered by the buyback. That gives us a certain financial return. And we compare that to the opportunities we have of acquiring businesses and the net present value of those businesses. So it really is an economic view of what is the best use of the shareholders' for -- of the funds of Pfizer shareholders. Lipitor, Olivier? Sorry, David.","David S. Simmons","Gregg, yes, the question on learnings from Lipitor, I'd probably break these into 2 pieces. The first is we've done a lot of market research and learned, one, that in-depth, the incentives that are occurring from different stakeholders in the healthcare environment during the LOE period, both from day 1 to day 180 and then also post 180. And this cuts across payers, pharmacists and the patients themselves. And through those learnings and research, we've also been able to discover a significant percentage of patients who want to remain on the brand. They don't feel that they understand how they can do that. And we've been developing strategies of how to tap into that desire without increasing cost to the healthcare system. So the learnings are on that front. The second thing that I would add in is that the response to the strategies that we've put in have been very strong. We're pleased with where we are in the Lipitor progress. Our share of branded Lipitor is tracking some 40-plus percent higher than historic analogs, so the strategies appear to be working. And as we go into upcoming LOEs, assuming we get the same type of market research reads, we will be applying the learnings from Lipitor, tweaking them and trying to continue with our core goal, which is to make sure we maximize revenue, profit and patient value from our brands.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, David. That being said, the Lipitor opportunity is unique in its size. And the 180-day period, I'm not sure how many molecules going forward will have that same dynamic, as I believe the law has been changed to allow same-day filing. So you won't have one company with 180-day exclusivity. You'll have multiple companies. So I think that will change the dynamic of post-LOE marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First one for Ian. Appreciate the color, Ian, on the 2 separate businesses post divestitures of Nutritional, Animal Health. Can you maybe go a little bit more in detail on the description of how you return the pharma portion of that business to growth relative to the value portion and then how you resource those 2 parts of the business? And is there additional room for improvements in the efficiency of R&D and what you're spending in SI&A as you think about those going forward? Second question on the ACIP panel. Just help us understand what kind of recommendation you're expecting out of that panel and how that is potentially going to facilitate the uptake of Prevnar 13 in adults.","Ian C. Read","Okay. I'll take the first one, and I'll ask Geno to talk to the second one. So thank you for the question, John. I think, fundamentally, this sort of separation on my mind, or in fact in the way we run the businesses, will allow a sort of a focus on an innovative core and a clear understanding of the capital being deployed and the growth expectations from innovative products. So it'll allow the marketplace and ourselves to have a lot clearer view on are we returning cost of capital on our innovative endeavors and will allow a better valuation of that business and allow management to be held to better performance standards. And on the other side -- and your SI&A spend as well, which will be more tailored towards positions and investment in innovative products. Whereas you move to the value business, that becomes a business that sort of absorbs the impact of LOEs and then continues to grow post that and adds strong brands from Emerging Markets, and is a sort of value cash engine with a completely different cost structure. So in my mind, it does allow a clear valuation by the marketplace or by management of 2 businesses with 2 distinct models. So with that, I would hand it over to Geno to talk to the ACIP recommendation.","Geno J. Germano","Yes. On the ACIP question, John, the -- it's typical for ACIP to provide recommendations to the healthcare system after the approval of a new vaccine. And you know that Prevnar 13 was approved in December by FDA under their accelerated approval provision, recognizing the significant unmet need for a serious medical condition, in this case, pneumococcal pneumonia. So the ACIP needs to deliberate and discuss how this vaccine should be used or recommended to be used in light of the availability of a polysaccharide vaccine for the over 65 population. So we're not privy to exactly how they're going to vote or how they're going to guide on the use of Prevnar 13, but we know that Prevnar 13 is certainly a different vaccine with a conjugate technology. And the ultimate recommendations will influence the uptake of the vaccine in the U.S.","Ian C. Read","Yes. And additional to that, post their recommendation, we will have the CAPITA trials that we expect by the end of '12 or early '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just had a couple of questions. One, can you give us a little more color on Prevnar in the quarter? It just seems a little lighter than what we would've expected. And then second, can you give us an update on the uptake of crizotinib, kind of what's going on behind the scenes there, and also an update on REMOXY and what's happening there?","Ian C. Read","Okay, thank you, Marc. So Geno, can do the Prevnar and the Xalkori, and then I'll ask Olivier to talk about REMOXY.","Geno J. Germano","Okay, so for Prevnar 13. Prevnar 13's humming along. Overall worldwide sales were $3.7 billion in 2011, up 50% from 2010. So the vaccine is doing extremely well on a global basis. As you mentioned, sales in the fourth quarter in the U.S. atypically were soft compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. And it's simply because the catch-up opportunity was strong in the fourth quarter 2010. So comparing one quarter to the other, we see a change in the growth rate. So the fourth quarter of '11, we had much less catch-up and there was some adjustment of inventories in doctors' offices and in the supply chain as a result of that re-established demand level for Prevnar 13. In terms of Xalkori or crizotinib, this was approved last summer, a new personalized medicine with a companion diagnostic. We're happy with the progress so far. The diagnostic is widely available now, essentially in all major clinical sites and academic medical centers. Usage is accelerating pretty dramatically. There's been a doubling of the use of the diagnostic so far, and we expect yet another doubling of the use of diagnostic in this coming year. Growth for Xalkori or crizotinib is going to come from the accumulation of new patients and the sustained duration of therapy. And we know from our Phase II trials that patients were sustained for a much longer period of time than on previous therapy. So we see the development of the drug occurring over time. And then, of course, we're continuing to explore utilization of crizotinib in other subtypes of patients with different mutations and in combinations with other pipeline therapies.","Olivier Brandicourt","All right. Marc, on REMOXY, we spent the last few months trying to understand the issue. We have now a much better understanding of the formulation, the manufacturing controls and what we need as analytical test in term of methods. So in addition to that, we will have to conduct 2 bioavailability study that we'll run during the second quarter this year. And when we will have all this data, we think that it will constitute the basis for our engagement with the FDA. And we anticipate meeting with the FDA during the third quarter this year to discuss next step.","Operator","Your next question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.","Barbara A. Ryan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess the question is for you, Ian. You talked about the 2 different businesses, the innovative core and the more mature established products and the different P&Ls. And the focus on that from investors, I'm just wondering, when and if you would provide more transparency into the difference of the P&Ls of those 2 companies so we could in fact value them and model them differently.","Ian C. Read","Thanks for the question. Yes, I sort of see that developing approach to that as we go through '12.  We need to, first of all, complete the potential separation of Nutri and Animal Health. And then as we do that and we look at our P&Ls and we enter into late '12 or '13, I expect us to have a more clearer way of describing those 2 businesses to the shareholders. And I think it also -- going back to a question from Jami, we see our research being focused on neuroscience and CVMED, oncology, inflammation, vaccines and pain. And so that's a very focused portfolio, where we are looking to really focus on personalized medicine and bringing forward products that have a differentiation, both in clinically and from a genetic standpoint. So I think that's the transformation we're talking about in our science.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 3 questions. First, historically, Pfizer has treated businesses to be divested as discontinued. So what does not considering Animal and Nutrition discontinued tell us about the status of the actions on those businesses? Secondly, on tofacitinib, did Pfizer request a priority review and it was turned down by FDA? And then thirdly, should we assume that a good portion of the Lipitor sales force at peak, so at the peak marketing force, will be marketing Eliquis? And I'm also wondering if you'd help us craft an expectation for the rollout. So should we think of the rollout as PRADAXA- or Xarelto-like? Or would you like us to think about it as being appreciably better driven by the data?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Steve. Frank, if you could take the first question?","Frank A. D'Amelio","Sure. So in terms of not having discontinued ops treatment, as of today, Steve, that's because no decision's been made. Just to -- we've said all along, we're on track to finalize our strategic decisions regarding the Animal Health and Nutri business. We said we would do that this year. We're pleased with the progress we've made to date. In terms of our objective, nothing's changed. Our objective is to generate, to create the greatest after-tax value for our shareholders, and we will be providing updates on this as we move through the year. But the reason why it's not being accounted for as disc ops is simply because we haven't made a final decision.","Ian C. Read","Tofacitinib?","Geno J. Germano","Yes. On the tofacitinib question, we did not request a priority review. We are seeking a broad label with usage in patients in second-line as well as third-line therapy. So we didn't go for a priority review for an unmet need in the post-TNF indication.","Ian C. Read","Okay. And then on the Lipitor, stroke, Eliquis question, I'll make a couple of comments, and then Olivier can add to it. I think from a point of view of your modeling, our resources have been dimensioned for both post Lipitor and an Eliquis launch as of the end of the fourth quarter of this year. And as regard to Eliquis, I see that marketplace -- number one, I see the advent of having 3 products in that segment as positive in the sense of it's a new class. It needs medical education. It needs continued promotion. And having 3 products in that class will be positive for the overall expansion of the class. And we would expect, given the fact that the strength of our data, for us to be -- to take a leadership role in that class.  Olivier, do you want to give any...","Olivier Brandicourt","Nothing much to add to that, frankly. With BMS, we think we have optimized the launch and we are putting the right amount of resources to make sure that we are very competitive with cardiologists and primary care physician. And as you said, it's going to be competitive. But we think we have one of the best-in-class profile. And again, we have the right resources behind it.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a couple questions on the growth outlooks. With respect to Emerging Markets, the revenue growth x currency was 5% in 2011. Can you please provide a little bit of color on what the growth outlook is in 2012? And then basically, similar questions with respect to Nutritional and Animal Health. Nutritional grew 11% last year, constant currency. I'm hoping that you might be able to provide some color on the outlook for '12. And Animal grew 14% last year.  Wondering if you could provide perspectives on the growth outlook for that segment.","Ian C. Read","Okay. I'll make a couple of comments on Emerging Markets, and I'll ask David to expand upon it, and I think ask Frank to handle the questions on Nutritional and Animal Health. So Emerging Markets growth in '11 was volume, 10%, and the price reductions of 5% were beyond our expectations of sustainable price reductions in Emerging Markets. So we continue to expect volume at double digits, and we expect to continue to see pricing pressures, but not of the level we saw in 2011. And David, do you want to add any more color to that?","David S. Simmons","Yes, just to call out a couple items. And when we look at Emerging Markets as a backdrop, we see 2 fundamentally strong trends that aren't going away over time. One is the increase in population masses overall, and the second is increase in the wealth of these population masses. So that's the backdrop that keeps us very optimistic about opportunities in Emerging Markets. Now as Ian mentioned, the price erosion we saw in 2011 was a little stronger than what we had anticipated, and we've factored that into our views going forward. We do expect to improve our growth rate moving forward. We would expect to increase this up to high single digits. And our strategies to do that are focused around maximizing the opportunity space of our in-line innovative portfolio, having very, very targeted approaches to the generic market, more targeted than we've ever had, and also being able to adapt to unique local market opportunities. Those are the 3 fundamental strategic pillars that we think will cause an uplift in the inflection of growth rate.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, David. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio","And then on Animal Health and on Nutri, let me just add the absolute numbers to that. So Animal Health this past year, we did $4.2 billion in sales, and in the Nutri business, we did $1.2 billion in sales. And both had strong growth rates, to your point, 14% and 10%, respectively. $2.1 billion in Nutri, $4.2 billion in Animal Health.","Ian C. Read","Correct.","Frank A. D'Amelio","We expect strong performance going forward and all of that performance has been factored into our 2012 guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a few questions here. First, can you talk about your Established Product growth here? I guess it's tough for us to get a clean read on this, given some of the recent off-patent assets securing growth like Effexor. Can you just talk about the growth or decline you're seeing in that business, let's say, for the, I don't know, pre-2010 products in this portfolio to help us understanding the kind of underlying trends that you're seeing in that business? Second, on gross margins. Can you just confirm what your expectations for gross margins are for this year and what type of quarterly progression we should be thinking about, given the Lipitor decline throughout the year? I guess what I'm trying to get out here is what your gross margins look like exiting this year. And then the final question is on the tax rate. It's roughly 500 basis points above your competitors. Why are we seeing this? And when or if should we start thinking about those rates starting to come down?","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Chris. So if David could comment on Established Products, and Frank could handle gross margin and the tax rate.","David S. Simmons","Sure. Chris, you're asking the question the right way. You've got to separate out the products that are going through LOE events last year and into this year because you've got an abnormal comp. So if you remove out Zosyn, Protonix and Effexor, that was the major cause of the decline in Established Products. So when you go back to that original base of legacy Pfizer brands going back to 2009, plus the addition of growth initiatives like some of the generic work we've been doing, what you see is that business that was decreasing 3 years ago at about minus 18% to minus 20%, that business has been stabilized. So if you look on that basis this year, the growth on that business segment plus those select growth initiatives got to flat. So we stopped the deterioration on that business. And those strategies'll continue going forward. Whether we can hold that line or not, we'll have to see. It's a very dynamic market in this off-patent market.","Frank A. D'Amelio","On gross margin. So in 2011 -- I think I'll answer this by doing cost of sales. And then the gross margin is just a reciprocal. So in 2011, our cost of sales was 19.3% for the year. Our guidance for 2012 is 20.5% to 21.5% on cost of sales guidance. And what's happening there clearly is that's increasing, which means there's downward pressure on the gross margin. And that's based on the change or shift in the company's business and geographic mix, including things like the Lipitor LOE. That said, we continue to believe we can achieve operating margins in the high 30s to low 40s because some of the primary care revenues is being replaced by revenues like in places like Emerging Markets, where we don't need as much of an expense base to generate those revenues. So there's clearly some pressure on gross margins, but we continue to believe we can generate operating margins that are in the high 30s to low 40s. In terms of quarter-to-quarter, there'll be volatility quarter-to-quarter based on how the mix of the business changes from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we provide the guidance on an annual basis. In terms of the tax rate, let me just give a little history on this, and then I'll answer the question. Pre-Wyeth, our tax rate was in the low 20s. When we announced the Wyeth acquisition, we increased the tax rate to approximately 30%, and part of the reason for that had to do with the amount of cash that we planned on repatriating. That repatriation of cash continues, which is why we gave guidance for 2012 of approximately 29%, which is pretty much what we predicted in 2011. We predicted 29.5%. One other point on the 29.5%, it was down year-over-year from 29.7% in 2010 to 29.5% in 2011. I think in '12, we should assume that 25% and beyond '12 with all of the winds blowing fiscally globally today, it's hard to predict tax rates. But I think we should assume for the time being a rate that's approximately 29%.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Frank. I mean, the only thing that would change that would be fundamental tax reform in United States, which we would hope would move the United States more in line with the rest of the developed world on its corporate tax rate and even to a territorial system, which potentially as you pointed out, would have a differential impact on Pfizer vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Jeff Holford here. Three questions for you, if you can. Firstly, what important readouts could we see from tofacitinib this year in ongoing clinical studies and if you can give us any indication of potential timelines you think could happen there? Secondly, when you talk about fixing the innovative core, as you put it in your release, is that deemed to be an internal organic process? Or does that rely on to some or a large extent on acquisition or licensing going forwards? And then just lastly, on the disposal process, news wires indicate that there's a number of buyers out there for the Nutrition business, but it's less clear on the Animal Health side. Can you give us any update if you are seeing a number of potential interested buyers for that business?","Ian C. Read","All right. Geno, if you could do the tofacitinib, I'd like to have Mikael to give a comment on the innovative core, which we see as both internally being better and also reaching outside of our borders, seeking the best science. And the third question was on Animal Health, which Frank can deal with.","Geno J. Germano","So for tofacitinib, we read out our 5 pivotal trials over the course of the year in 2011. In 2012, there'll be additional analyses from those databases that'll be presented at EULAR and ACR later in the year. And I really can't comment on the specific sub-analyses that will be presented at this point.","Ian C. Read","Okay, Mikael, if you could just have a comment on the innovative core?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So I'm very excited about the flow of the pipeline. And you have seen strong discipline in the late-stage pipeline as exemplified by comments from Geno and Olivier. And we have a pipeline out with lots of opportunities of differentiated drugs from early, mid to late stage. And just to give you highlight on some of the stages that you not have been able to follow as closely. So in immuno inflammation, we have a number of Phase II assets such as MAdCAM, IL-6 and dissociated steroids for indications from Crohn, RA and to lupus. In oncology, we have a number of exciting signal transduction inhibitors in both solid and hematological tumors. In vaccine, we have not only mening B, but we have staph aureus in the Phase II studies. And we're bringing in towards the clinic vaccine for nicotine and later on to Plastene [ph] and [indiscernible]. In cardiometabolic, you heard Olivier to speak about Eliquis. We have a very encouraging data on our PCSK9 antibody for cholesterol lowering. We have multiple diabetes read-outs in Phase II, and we also have a very interesting drug, PDE5, a very selective inhibitor for diabetic nephropathy. Similarly, neuro pain, where we had a discussion around bapi, we are adding a new generation of drugs in the pain portfolio with precision medicine focus, as Ian spoke to and a couple of more earlier CNS drugs. So as you can see, there is a lot of exciting drugs where we are highly differentiated and either best- or first-in-class in our aspiration.","Ian C. Read","Thank you, Mikael. I'd like to reinforce that. I think that we feel we've made good progress on the innovative core. But in a way, we feel at Pfizer, it's just the beginning as we continue to accelerate what we're doing by focusing in the therapeutic areas where we're in and merging together the biology and the chemistry that I think -- the biology from Wyeth and the chemistry from Pfizer to a best-in-class scientific organization.","Frank A. D'Amelio","And then on Animal Health. We've not yet decided on what the potential method of monetization is. However, we continue to explore all options and once again, with the goal being to maximize after-tax value to our shareholders. And on Animal Health, we are proceeding according to our internal plans. We remain on track, and we are pleased with the progress that we've made to date.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one brief question around Enbrel. The reps that you have today that are marketing to rheumatologists, if we make an assumption that tofacitinib is approved, do you actually continue to market Enbrel, given that you will -- your contract expires with Amgen in '13, I believe? And moreover, is this a product actually that will also be part of the bag of a rep who also is a -- who also is actually visiting primary care physicians?","Ian C. Read","I'll ask Geno to answer that question.","Geno J. Germano","So for Enbrel in the U.S., we currently copromote with Amgen, and that arrangement will expire at the end of 2013. So we are in dialogue with Amgen on how we'll make that transition. But ultimately, we will be promoting tofacitinib within Pfizer alone in the United States. Outside of the United States, we'll continue to have a role with Enbrel, and we'll manage Enbrel and tofacitinib in countries outside of the United States.","Operator","And your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just a couple of questions here. Ian, maybe you could just discuss for us what we're seeing in Europe with these developed market value determinations with the evolution of the German market, IQWiG, GBA and really what that might mean for the business and new products near term. And then also if you can just give us your sort of 30,000-foot view in terms of the expectations for these types of developments broadening and how you're approaching those types of things strategically. And then sorry for the long question there. But then lastly, can you also comment on what would prevent, if anything, a timely separation of either the Nutritionals business or the Animal Health business?","Ian C. Read","Okay. A pretty expansive question there on Europe. I'll ask Frank to talk about the timeliness of the Animal Health business for a second, and then come back to you on your first question.","Frank A. D'Amelio","So relative to Animal Health and Nutri, I mentioned for both that progress is proceeding. We're pleased with the progress. Things are moving according to plan. In terms of what would hinder the progress at this point, I don't see anything at this point hindering our progress. I think we're going down a good path and pleased with the progress and I think we'll continue to move down a good path.","Ian C. Read","All right. So regarding Europe. Europe has had HTA or healthcare technology assessments for a long period of time. And frankly, in Europe, as you pointed out, they tend to be used in conjunction with medical evidence also as a rationing tool. So as our portfolio changes, as Lipitor goes LOE, as some of our primary care products go LOE and we become a more specialty business, the medical differentiation and the value add is a lot more visible to those authorities than perhaps a primary care product would be. So I think while my view is that this practice will continue to expand outside of Europe and it's appropriate that payers and the government expect value from their medication, I think in the U.S., we'll see a broader view of what value is, including wider stakeholders than in Europe including the caregivers and the patients, a less narrow definition, a more -- of value to society. And I feel once again, our portfolio is evolving. And certainly, our research is focused in a way that we'll have the data and the differentiation to be successful in that environment where there is health technology assessments.","Charles E.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter 2013 performance. I am joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read, Frank D'Amelio, our CFO, Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer, Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development, Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma, John Young, President of Established Pharma and Douglas Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2013 which is located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 28, 2014.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian Read","Thank you, Chuck and good morning, everyone. We finished 2013 with a solid fourth quarter and the overall financial performance of the year was strong. Looking at the quarter, we delivered good operational performance, revenues in the emerging markets grew 9%, established products revenues grew 6%, oncology revenues grew 29% and consumer healthcare grew 2%.","We also had strong quarterly revenue performance operationally from key inline products such as Lyrica which grew 14%, Celebrex which grew 9% and Enbrel, outside of North America, which grew 8%. We continue to see positive progress of our recently launched products, Eliquis and Xeljanz. For Eliquis, in the last two quarters of 2013, we saw definitive momentum across key metrics resulting from the actions that we implemented together with our partners BMS.","While we are starting from a small base, the trend we are seeing on sales growth for Pfizer is significant. Specifically we saw a 124% increase in sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter and TRX volume in the US for Eliquis increased 68% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2013. For Xeljanz, we continue to see a steady increase in U.S. scripts, over 28% growth in TRX volume in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013. Physician feedback continues to be positive. To date, nearly 3,500 ACP have prescribed Xeljanz and nearly 80% have repeat prescribers.","Now turning to highlights for the year. We met or exceeded every element of our financial guidance. We drove operational growth in key products including Lyrica, Enbrel outside of North America. Looking at how our business performed operationally, emerging markets reported solid single-digit growth of 6%, oncology grew 29% and consumer health business grew 5%.","We saw advancement in our pipeline across the portfolio. We achieved approval in the U.S. for DUAVEE for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. We expect to launch next month and the FDA approved a prior approval supplement for Embeda extended release capsules.","We initiated a Phase 3 program which include includes pivotal and several outcomes studies for bococizumab the proposed generic name for our PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower LDL cholesterol. We initiated two Phase 3 studies of Palbociclib on advanced breast cancer and began enrolling patients in the third Phase 3 study with a German Breast Group in patients with early breast cancer at a high-risk of recurrence. We initiated a Phase 3 program with our partner Merck for ertugliflozin, our SGLT2 inhibitor, for the treatment of Type II diabetes.","We concluded a Phase 2 study for our staph aureus vaccine which showed encouraging signals that our vaccine elicits positive immune response. We expect to present this data at a medical conference this year. We completed the Phase 2a proof of concept study of a novel PDE5 inhibitor in diabetic neuropathy, which showed encouraging clinical profile warranting further exploration in Phase 2b. We conducted Phase 1 proof of concepts on biosimilars of rituximab and infliximab which concluded with positive outcomes on the relevant study endpoints.","For Xeljanz in Europe, where we received a negative opinion last year for our rheumatoid arthritis indication, we will continue to registration on active and engaging discussion with regulators and the development of additional data to support a refilling, although we continue to expect this will result in a several year delay.","We reduced our total adjusted cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses on an operational basis by approximately 3% which is about an $850 million reduction versus 2012 levels. We completed the separation of Zoetis and generated approximately $17.3 billion in after-tax value. We returned nearly $23 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases and we put in place and are operating in our new commercial structure. Each business has strongly leadership in place and we believe that by having a sharper focus we can to better maximize the performance of all our businesses. In terms of financial transparency, we will provide a management view of profit and loss for each business starting with the first quarter results this year.","To sum up the year, we strengthened our innovative core by advancing key R&D programs, create significant value for shareholders through disciplined capital allocation and our commercial businesses have performed well during a time of transition and difficult market dynamics. Three years ago, we laid out the priorities and strategies for how we will create value for each of our businesses and address R&D productivity challenges. Over the course of last three years, our priorities and our strategies have not changed and I believe it's showing strong results.","Again, in 2014, you can expect us to remain intensely focused on maximizing the opportunities within each of our commercial businesses, continue to advance science, innovation and our pipeline and prudently deploying our capital. We see distinct opportunities for each of the commercial businesses this year. The Global Innovative Pharma Business will focus on accelerating the uptake trajectory of newly launched products, Xeljanz and Eliquis, and driving growth for major inline brands like Lyrica Enbrel outside of North America, Viagra in the U.S. and Chantix.","The Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare Business, respectively, will capitalize on the Prevnar 13 franchise, concentrate on the recently launched oncology products, Xalkori, Inlyta and Bosulif and launch over-the-counter Nexium in Europe and in the U.S. provided it receives FDA approval.","The Global Established Pharma Business will focus on maximizing key Peri-LOE brands, namely Celebrex, Lyrica in the EU and Zyvox. It will support continued growth from important legacy old patented brands such as Lipitor and Norvasc in emerging markets, build on local partnerships like those with Mylan, Teuto and Hisun and advanced growth opportunities with the sterile injectables by some of those portfolio.","Building on the pipeline advances achieved in 2013, there are several potential milestones in 2014. We expect to report in the near future the topline results for Phase 2 study of Palbociclib in patients with post-menopausal, ER-positive, advanced breast cancer. The results for the CAPiTA trial for Prevnar 13 in adults age 65 and older are expected to readout during this quarter and if supportive we expect to discuss the data with the advisory committee on immunization practices, ACIP, in the U.S. and other regulatory authorities.","Along with our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are seeking approved for Eliquis VTE prevention in orthopedic patients in the U.S. and VTE treatment in the U.S. and Europe. We have two pivotal trials in the Xeljanz Phase 3 oral psoriasis program that anticipates to readout in the second quarter. For the staph aureus and meningitis B vaccines, we anticipate sharing results from Phase 2 studies at medical conferences this year, while advancing the late stage development of both assets.","Last week, we announced the topline Phase 3 results for ALO-02, an investigational agent, called oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone. It met the primary efficacy endpoints in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain demonstrating a statistically significant difference compared to placebo.","Yesterday, we announced topline results for two Phase 3 studies, BR.26 and ARCHER 1009, that evaluated dacomitinib in two different populations of previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. While we are disappointed that neither study met its primary endpoints, we will continue to evaluate the full dataset from both trials to understand that molecularly defined subgroups of patients may derive benefit from dacomitinib. In order to continue development of a robust pipeline of highly differentiated molecules in vaccines that has the potential to be either first or best in class such as the therapeutic I just noted, requires ongoing R&D investment.","In 2014, we will continue to be prudent towards how we allocate capital and we will balance these incremental R&D investment with the need for delivering overall shareholder return. As we have done in the past, we will continue to use business development opportunities as enabler of strategies to create value for our shareholders.","In summary, we start 2014 with a sound strategy and a strong business. We will build on our performance in 2013 by continuing to create a sustainable high-value pipeline and establishing strong commercial businesses. By executing on our new product launches, growing key in-line products, delivering on the potential at all phases of the pipeline and effectively deploying our capital, we will further strengthen the whole of our businesses. Our top priority and commitment is to develop and to bring to patients innovative medicines that meet their needs and together with our actions we will generate an enhanced shareholder value.","Now I will turn it over to Frank to take you through the details of the quarter and our financial guidance for 2014.","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Ian and good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to remind everybody that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013 the financial results of the Animal Health business are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for full-year 2013 and fourth-quarter and full-year 2012.","Now let's move on to the financials. Fourth-quarter 2013 reported revenues were approximately $13.6 billion which decreased 2% year-over-year and reflect operational growth of approximately 1%, driven mainly by the strong performance of Lyrica, Celebrex, Inlyta and Xalkori globally, Enbrel outside of North America and Xeljanz and Eliquis primarily in the U.S. These were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $397 million or 3%, the expiration on October 31, 2013 of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in North America, continued erosion for branded Lipitor in developed Europe and certain other developed markets, the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva, collaboration in certain countries, other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets and decreased government purchases of Prevnar in certain emerging markets among other items.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.56 increased 22%, primarily due to the operational decrease of adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses and increase in other income, due primarily to the sale of a portion of our in-license generic sterile injectables portfolio to Mylan, a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income and substantially fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchases and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.39 compared with $0.85 in the year ago quarter, driven by the significant negative impact of the non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations attributable to the Animal Health and Nutrition businesses including the gain on the sale of the Nutrition business in the year ago quarter. In addition to the previously mentioned factors, reported diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to favorable audit settlements, lower charges related to asset impairments and legal matters and lower acquisition related expenses.","During the fourth quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets increased, driven primarily by strong volume growth in China, especially for Lipitor. In these BRIC-MT markets, volume growth of 6% was partially offset by foreign exchange of 3% versus the year ago quarter. Revenue from all emerging markets increased 9% operationally in the fourth quarter with China growing approximately 19% operationally. If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with Hisun, in the fourth quarter we would have had operational revenue growth of 10% in our overall emerging markets business, 9% in the BRIC-MT markets and 27% in China compared with the year ago quarter.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter revenues by $397 million or 3% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $251 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01. As you can see, in 2013, we met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance including exceeding our adjusted diluted EPS guidance.","Now I would like to comment specifically on a few of the elements of our 2014 guidance. First, we expect adjusted revenues to be in the range of $49.2 billion to $51.2 billion. I want to point out that this range reflects an anticipated $3 billion negative impact due to declining alliance revenues specific to 2014 notably the Enbrel collaboration in North America and the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in the U.S. and other developed markets and the loss of exclusivity of certain products in several geographies, including Viagra in the EU, Japan and Australia, Detrol in the U.S. and Aricept in major developed markets.","I also want to point out that our 2014 adjusted revenue guidance also reflects an additional $1.4 billion negative impact due to the year-over-year difference in actual foreign exchange rates in mid-January of 2013 compared with mid-January of 2014, mainly driven by the movement of the Yen against the U.S. dollar. So, had we applied the rates from mid-January of '13 to our 2014 guidance, the adjusted revenue range would have been $1.4 billion higher.","We expect cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 19% to 20%, an increase from the 18% we recorded in 2013 driven by the significant decrease in alliance revenues. It's important to remember that these alliance revenues were recorded at 100% gross margin because there is no associated cost of sales. Consequently the significant decrease of these revenues will also negatively impact our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in 2014.","We expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion which reflects spending in support of key product launches as well as the benefit of our continued cost reduction and productivity initiatives. We expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion to support Phase 3 studies initiated in late 2013 and early 2014. We also expect adjusted other deductions to be approximately $100 million. I want to remind everyone that the recognition of profits from the Enbrel collaboration in North America has shifted from alliance revenue to other income as we have moved to a royalty structure.","We expect our tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 27%. Finally we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. This range includes anticipated share repurchases of approximately $5 billion this year which will more than offset some expected dilution related to employee compensation programs.","It's important to note that our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance absorbs an $0.08 negative impact resulting from the previously mentioned difference in actual foreign exchange rates from mid-January 2013 compared with mid-January 2014. As always, we will continue to monitor foreign exchange fluctuations and we will update the potential impact, if any, on our 2014 expectations.","So moving on to key takeaways, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our full year 2013 financial guidance in a continuing challenging environment. In 2013 we completed the separation of our Animal Health business and created a new commercial structure that was successfully implemented at the beginning of this year. We provided full-year 2014 financial guidance which reflects the negative impact of $3 billion due to declining alliance revenues and expected product losses of exclusivity. In addition, our guidance for adjusted R&D expenses reflects our investment in several Phase 3 studies initiated in late 2013 and early 2014. We will continue to mitigate the impact of product losses of exclusivity and declining alliance revenue with growth of certain other products as well as expense discipline and share repurchases.","We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2013 we repurchased $16.3 billion or 563 million shares. Overall in 2013, we returned almost $23 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past three years, we have returned almost $53 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 we expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock. Finally we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I will turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank, and Ian as well. With that, operator, please if we could now poll for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","Hello. Thank you. A couple of questions, please. You have, no doubt, seen various analysts reports predicting what the financials for the three divisions will look like, and I know you are planning on providing those details on your Q1 call, but can you give us your preliminary thoughts on what you are seeing thus far from the street. Do you think we will end up being surprised by how the numbers fall out between the different divisions or do you think the analyses you have seen look reasonable?","Then on Palbociclib, any updated perspective on the likelihood of being able to file on the final Phase 2 results? I know that it is approaching. I would imagine you have already had some discussions with the agency or at least at a minimum have some thoughts on the matter?","Ian Read","Okay. Thank you, Tim. I will ask Frank to answer the question that you posed on the financial divisions and when you will see the results and then I would ask Albert Bourla to comment on Palbociclib.","Frank D'Amelio","So, Tim, clearly we have looked at several models that have been put together relative to what the new businesses will look like. I think the rhythm of those numbers is directionally correct. Just how I would describe it. Obviously we will come out with our numbers for our first quarter 2014 results, but I think directionally correct is how I would describe it. I don't expect what we will publish will create any big suprises.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Frank. Tim, on palbo, as you alluded, our discussions with FDA are productive and they are ongoing and this is particularly true, given the breakthrough therapy designation we have received from them. Now, these discussions will continue after the Phase 2 analyses becomes available. Therefore the exact regulatory path forward has not yet been determined. Now having said that, we can envision a scenario where depending upon the strength of the final Phase 2 data there may be a pathway to file with the FDA based upon these Phase 2 results. However as you know, the acceptance of an filing is ultimately an FDA decision.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Albert. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America","Thanks. Just sticking with the palbo theme, could you comment on the competitive landscape in light of Novartis and Lilly's progress and what differentiation you could speak to at this early stage?","For Frank, can you put a little more meat on the bone on the gross margin commentary? What are the drivers for lower gross margin in '14 and whether those items are trends or blips? Thank you.","Ian Read","So, Albert, palbo again.","Albert Bourla","Yes. As you are aware, there is very limited information in the public domain on these compounds from these companies. So its really difficult to differentiate palbo at this point until we see some more efficacy and safety data from them. On palbo, on the contrary, we have seen data and we are encouraged by the magnitude of the clinical activity we have seen in our patient population. So we are really looking forward to our final Phase 2 results.","Ian Read","Thank you, Frank?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. So, Gregg, on the gross margin, let me walk through this and I am going to bridge this because I think it will be helpful. So let me run the numbers first. We printed 18% for the full year 2013. We are providing guidance for next year of 19% to 20%. So now let me build a bridge.","If we remove foreign exchange, the positive impact of foreign exchange we had last year on cost of sales because it lowered cost of sales, that 18% becomes 18.5%. So 18% to 18.5%. Then if you did the accounting for Enbrel in '13, the way we were going to do the accounting for it in '14, which is don't show it is alliance revenues but show it as royalties, that 18.5% would become 19%. So now 18% between 19% and then that 19% to 20% in 2014 is really a result of the other alliance revenue declines, primarily Spiriva and then some of the product LOEs, and one key point to make here is the big decline year in alliance revenues is in 2014.","So that's the way to think about the rhythm of the numbers.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Next question please, operator","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Also congratulations on great P&L management in '14. I know a lot of people were nervous about the alliance revenue lines and everything. So well done. I just want to ask a question that you probably get a lot, but I thought I would ask it on a call. And that is, is there a scenario that you can envision, Frank or Ian, where you might sell your established products or at least your generics unit in some kind of a tax advantage the way prior to 2017?","Then just the only other question I had, if I might, is if my calculations are correct, R&D plus SG&A crept up a little bit as a percentage of revenue at the midpoint versus 2013. I was just wondering, I know you are not going to give guidance beyond 2014 but in general, are you comfortable where analysts models are or should we expect that trend to continue as at 2014 blip? Thanks a lot.","Ian Read","Thank you. I think on the R&D, our R&D spend has been responsive to late Phase 3 assets that we have a high confidence than anyone to invest in and have a Phase 3 with (inaudible). So I think we will fund, well, you expect us to fund Phase 3 assets to the extent we see great opportunity for them and we will continue to do that, that we will continue to manage our overall P&L as we do that.","On the potential sale of our established products business, you know, we are managing all three businesses to create value for the company and I think the immediate focus of this is to get these businesses which have very strong management teams which they have, put focus on the different ways of delivering value and to drive value for Pfizer shareholders. There are also several data requirements which restrict our ability to enter into any transaction even if some of we wanted to at this stage and I will ask Frank to talk about that.","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. So Mark, it is Olympian, but let me try to rip through this which is, it depends on the type of transaction. So if it's a public transaction, so what's a public transaction. A partial spend, complete spend, a reverse Morris Trust, a partial IPO, a partial IPO followed by spin or a split, three years of audited financials are required. That's a requirement.","If it's a private transaction, a partial sale of the business, a complete sale of the business, formation of a joint venture where we have a minority, where we have a majority interest, no audited financials are required. However a significance test is required, the results of which may require audited financials.","Let me rip through these significance tests. There is three tests that make up this significance test. There is an asset test, an income test and an investment test. Basically it's the target's results for each of those test as a percentage of the acquirer's results. So think about income, it would be the target's income as a percentage of the acquirer's income.","Now the way the results work or the test work is if all three tests are less than 20%, no audited financials are required. If any one test is greater than 20% and lower than 40%, between 20% and 40%, one year of audited financials is required. Between 40% and 50% in any one test, two years of audited financials. Any one test greater than 50%, two years of audited balance sheet, three years of audited P&Ls, cash flows, other comprehensive income and shareholders' equity statements.","So that's basically what's required and why it's required. That's a summary.","Ian Read","Thank you, Frank. As you can see, Mark, we have a lot of asset issues, and I would say that we want to create optionality and the best way to create optionality is having strong results and transparency on these results over the next few years, and that's what we are focused this on. Thank you.","Chuck Triano","Thank you, Ian and thanks, Frank, for the detail there. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Just to follow-up on that. Ian, if you could talk about the value business, which is what we are all focused on here, the emerging markets and established products business, that's a huge part of the overall Pfizer story, and while we appreciate that you are going to focus on driving value to each of these businesses, maybe you could talk about how you think about the margin and growth potential of this business? What are the true durable earnings performance that you seek from this business? Because, from what we see, the growth of established is really just coming from shifting products that go generic into that business, and then the emerging markets space is obviously very difficult to predict. So maybe if you can provide your view on how you see this business as a standalone performing over the next three years or so?","Then just as a follow-up to the breakup scenario, Frank, you said three years of financial audit information is required. So if we get this, before showing the data in the first quarter this year, does that then mean that the earliest you could contemplate a full breakup would be end of 2016? Thanks.","Ian Read","Thank you, Jami. Well, obviously as I said, the established products business is not a homogeneous business. It is heterogeneous business with many different opportunities. We have very strong management teams in all our businesses. So I am going to ask John Young to answer your good questions over how we will manage the established business to grow. And on the last point, I think yes, we are indicating that we would have three years financial by the end of '16.","John Young","Okay. So thanks for the question, Jami. So maybe just to say a little bit about what this business is. I think certainly we believe that this is not only a very large business unit, to your point, about its contribution to Pfizer overall, but actually a very attractive, a very diverse and a very profitable business with actually some unique opportunities across different portfolios and geographies. So let me just walk you through a little bit, what this business really comprised of.","Broadly, we think it as in four buckets. There is a Peri-LOE business in developed markets. It includes some of the major brands that currently are pre-LOE such as Celebrex, Zyvox, Lyrica in the EU. Certainly, we are going to be very focused in that segment on maximizing the profitability of those brands, both sides of the LOE spectrum and leveraging some of the capability from EP that we think has really done a pretty good job with some of the recent LOEs such as Lipitor compared to market proxies.","The second segment of that business is really a legacy EP business that comprises mature off- patent products in developed markets. That business is declining but we are very focused on maximizing profitability through targeted investments in certain brands in that portfolio that present opportunities for growth.","The third piece of the business is really what comprises probably a little more than 70% of the emerging market business today and that business is growing pretty strongly. You have seen the results from the fourth quarter for the emerging market business overall. we believe that portfolio and actually the think of the mature products in Global Established Pharma portfolio is a great fit, actually for a lot of the healthcare needs that we see in some of the key emerging markets such as China and Brazil and Mexico. That is growing today and we envisage that that will continue to grow in the future.","Then the last component of this business really is what we think of as growth opportunities. Now some of those growth opportunities will be medium term growth opportunities such as the biosimilar portfolio. We think we have one of the leading biosimilar portfolios in the industry with five assets in different stages of development. But we actually have a number of other opportunities too, through areas of growth such as some of the partnerships that you are already aware of with Teuto, Hisun, Mylan, all the way through. We are very pleased with them. They are performing well and we are going to be very active in looking for additional partnerships in targeted markets where we think there is an opportunity to drive shareholder value, opportunities for continued growth of sterile injectables and some targeted opportunities in certain markets for some reformulated branded generic products as well.","I think probably the last point to make is, this is really not a commodity generic business. In fact, less than 10% of our revenues would come from what you traditionally think of as being a generic business. So there is no doubt that we will see some pressure on revenues over the next few year driven by some of the LOEs that everyone is well aware of from some of those Peri-LOE brands. Actually this is a business where we believe in the medium-term that it will plateau and we believe that we can then have a number of significant opportunities for growth with this business in the medium to longer term.","Ian Read","Thank you, John. Frank, you want to make a comment?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes, real quickly. Jami, I just want to punctuate what Ian said, which is three years prospective financials as I have said previously. So that would be '14, '15 and '16 financials and then obviously the '16 10-K wouldn't be done until the end of February 2017. So optionality, if we decided to do so, it will be sometime in 2017.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Frank. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much. Just staying on the established products side, recognize the near-term focus in that business is kind of walking on the performance but when you consider the long-term options for that business, I guess first of all, would you agree with the statement that this is the division where a larger merger could make the most sense for Pfizer? And following on that, can you walk through the pros and cons of a larger merger for that division as you consider your options relative to either running the business on your own or looking at tuck-in deals?","Then my second question is, just as we are thinking about capital deployment, is there any changes in the way you are thinking about share repo versus higher dividend payout or other opportunities in light of the new business structure? Does that change at all or just you want to have either more cash available as these business units work out their various options as you consider new structures, etcetera? Anything we should be thinking about there. Thanks very much.","Ian Read","So Chris, I think on the established products business, our focus is the creation of value. So we do have a quite impressive portfolio and a geographic presence across the emerging markets. And your question is, will further scale be useful? I think it depends very much on the opportunities that arise and we have to be opportunistic about that. Clearly if we can broader portfolio and specific scale in some of key countries, we would be interested in, which is why we have doing on JVs on a country-by-country basis and would be open to other alternatives as we always are that would create shareholder value. But clearly, we are going to focus right now on running that business, producing the value and open to various BD alternatives to create more value.","On the second question, the capital structure, I think you know as we have seen over the last few years, our capital structure and the we manage our capital has been focused on ensuring we produce the best return for our shareholders. We continue to manage that mix and I would ask Frank to make some more specific comments.","Frank D'Amelio","Chris, I think the short answer is our priorities have not changed. Maybe I will embellish a little bit. So clearly dividends, buybacks continue to remain important parts of our capital allocation. Investing in the business, you see that in '14 with our capital deployment for R&D, for launch costs and support of our new products and obviously business development remains a priority. So priorities haven't changed and you look at what we did with our dividend in December, we increased the dividend from $0.96 to a $1.04, an 8.3% increase. We just announced another $5 billion in repurchases of our shares. So the priorities have not changed. They remain the same.","Ian Read","I would just add to Frank's comment there. As I think we see ourselves in a position of well-balanced optionality in many directions, given our capital structure. Thank you, Frank.","Chuck Triano","Thanks, Ian. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Scala - Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen","Thank you. Two questions. First, I believe there is a pending court decision. So does your 2014 guidance bracket a scenario where generics to Celebrex launch in May of this or do the guidance elements not consider the scenario?","The second question is, I know FDA was aware of CAPiTA's design very early on. But what discussions have you had with ACIP on the design of CAPiTA? And are they comfortable that it did not compare Prevnar to Pneumovax? Thank you very much.","Ian Read","So Doug, do you want to comment on the Celebrex situation?","Douglas Lankler","Sure. Obviously, so we have our reissue patent on Cele that takes us through December 2015 and our trial to defend that patent is scheduled to commence on March 19 of this year.","Ian Read","Frank, you want to add anything to that?","Frank D'Amelio","Yes. Our guidance assumes we have a full-year of Celebrex.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert, on discussions with ACIP?","Albert Bourla","Yes, as you can imagine, once we have the results, we will determine the best approach to present the data to ACIP and request a recommendation. We have been in discussions with the CDC and members of ACIP to ensure their understanding of the protocol and the potential outcomes. So when they have the data they can move quickly. The ACIP meets three times per year. I cannot speculate in which meeting they will make a vote.","As regards your question for how would they compare it with Pneumovax. Again I cannot speculate on that, but if you look at current practice, in immunocompromised adults, age 19 years and older, that there is recommendation, ACIP has recommended routine use of Prevnar 13, administered in addition to Pneumovax.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert.","Chuck Triano","Excellent. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on your performance. I was wondering if you can provide us more color on the powering assumptions for CAPiTA and do you believe there is still enough residual disease among U.S. adults, given that Prevnar 13 has been available for four years and is probably significant herd effect?","Finally on palbo, is the Phase 2 sufficiently powered to detect a significant difference, statistically significant survival difference between the two arms? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you for that question. I believe the CAPiTA design was powered for three endpoints and it would have been designed well aware the herd effect. So I would ask Albert just to talk through the three endpoints of CAPiTA. You know, really, the response of ACIP will depend on those endpoints and that's why we have to wait for the trial to readout but I believe that it was very well designed trial, powered to achieve, show the results of the product's performance as we expect and then on the Phase 2, Albert, could you discuss the powering vis-\u00e0-vis overall survival?","Albert Bourla","Yes, well, I would say, CAPiTA is a lot complex trial. We have 85,000 health volunteers and the three endpoints are a primary endpoint to demonstrate the efficacy of the product in prevention of first episode of pneumococcal cap community, acquired pneumonia, of course, for the vaccine type. The secondary endpoint is to demonstrate the same efficacy in the first episode on non-bacteremic non-invasive cap and in invasive pneumococcal disease. As you said, the study is very well designed taken in consideration everything that study was post registration, post approval obligation which the FDA. So we have consulted with them for the protocol.","Ian Read","Thank you. On the Phase 2, do you want to that, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","I just had one comment on the herd effect that Alex asked about. Actually, in 2013, there has been some very useful publications from U.K. and U.S. that have studied, the epidemiology of various pneumococcal strains and have clearly shown that in the adult, and particularly the older adult population that is highly vulnerable to pneumococcal, there is a number of Prevnar 13 strains still occurring linked to disease and actually even Prevnar 7 strains are occurring.","So its just that the older population is more prone to pickup those strains and interesting is some strains that are not causing disease in younger population can cause substantial disease in the older population where we also see a substantially increased morbidity and also fatal outcomes. So we do believe that the recent data will favor the view of an existing unmet need in this population, and as Albert alluded to, pending the readout of CAPiTA, and this would be that all available study of this size that would show an effect in this population.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael. It's good questions and good to speculate. We will know at the end of the quarter and then we can discuss it in more detail. Albert, on the overall survival of palbo?","Albert Bourla","Yes. Data for overall survival is event driven. So therefore it is difficult to predict when the final overall survival data will be complete. Apparently the study is well-powered to cut any differences. We do anticipate preliminary overall survival data that could be presented at a medical conference in the first half of 2014 together with the other data.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert.","Chuck Triano","Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from John Boris from Suntrust.","John Boris - Suntrust","Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two. Just on Prevnar 13, you indicated that there is three times that ACIP meets. What's the earliest meeting and have you asked the ACIP yet for to be a part of the agenda at anyone of those three meetings yet?","Then secondly on Palbociclib. If you look at your binding affinity for CDK4 and CDK6, most notably on cyclin D1, D2 for CDK4, its 11 and 9 and cyclin D6, IC50 is 15 which suggests high degree of affinity, hence strongly correlated to efficacy. Is there anyway you might be able to contrast that to the activity of the Novartis and Lilly compounds?","Then the second part of that question on palbo is, there some off target effects that occur on greater than 30 other kinases. Has the FDA asked you to try and characterize any of those off target effects on palbo? Thanks.","Ian Read","Thank you John. Prevnar, ACIP, I think there are three meetings. One in February, one in June and one in October. I would find it doubtful we would make the February date and then when have the results, we will immediately engage with ACIP so they can review the results at the earliest point possible and one would expect their willingness to do that will depend on the results, in many ways. Mikael, do you want to comment on John's very scientific question there on palbo?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes, John. First with your detailed understanding of this kinase inhibitor and as you very well articulate that we have designed an inhibitor that would have potent activity against both kinases, which I do think is somewhat unique for Palbociclib. All kinases have some off target activities but we do believe that the therapeutic window for Palbociclib favors the on target profile, and if you look at efficacy and tolerability we have seen so far, the main adverse events related to neutropenia that has been well manageable is very much compatible with on target effect for these type of drugs.","Ian Read","And we don't really have enough detail on the competitive products to make any comparisons. Is that correct?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. We tend not to comment on other products and that's why I used the term that you inhibitors are well balanced and has a unique profile in that sense, and I think at this stage of clinical development, as Albert very well alluded to, we need to understand more from the competitive product as they advance in development.","Ian Read","Thank you.","Chuck Triano","Our next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I have two on the pipeline. For palbo, excited by your studies outside of breast cancer and where the most of the focus has been. Can you just talk at this point where you see palbo having the most potential outside of the lead breast cancer indication?","Then second on the PCSK9, just any comments there. You are going into Phase 3. Obviously it's a very large study. A lot of investment really needed there. Given some of the changing guidelines, maybe less of an emphasis on LDL and HDL target levels. How do you see the value of a PCSK9 program and would you consider maybe partnering that with someone, just given the amount that you would need to invest there? Thanks.","Ian Read","So, good questions. Palbo, Albert, outside of breast cancer, you may want to discuss a little bit of what we are doing there? Then Geno will do the PSK9 reply.","Albert Bourla","Yes. Vamil, expanding palbo beyond breast cancer is a top priority for us. Given the potential of this franchise, we are very focused on progressing in other few more types, as melanoma for example. There is an ongoing Phase 1\/2 study of palbo with Zelboraf and this is conducted by the National Cancer Institute of France and this is for BRAF mutations.","Also in addition, I am sure you have seen a recent announcement. We are working with GSK to evaluate palbo with their MEK inhibitor in metastatic melanoma, this time without BRAF mutations. This trial should begin in the first half of the year of 2014.","Now, if we look beyond melanoma, we are working with academic centers including the Dana-Farber Cancer Center to evaluate palbo in non-small cell lung cancer and to have numerous other collaborations and programs in other tumor types, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.","Ian Read","Thank you, Albert. Mike, sorry, Geno, PCSK9?","Geno Germano","On PCSK9, we have initiated our Phase 3 program. It's a broad program, as you can imagine, with multiple lipid-lowering studies and we have decided to go into two fairly large outcome studies as well with the intent to provide the broadest base of data of any of the PCSK9 program in the patient populations that we believe can benefit from the therapy.","We believe that outcomes, trials and the results of the outcomes trials are going to determine the place for these agents in management of patients with cardiovascular risk factors and high cholesterol levels. Our programs are designed to read out in a similar timeframe of the competitive programs as well. So we are excited about the program. We are often running with our Phase 3 program and we are at this point going in alone.","Ian Read","Thank you, Geno.","Charles Triano","Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi","Good morning. First on palbo. Should I assume that in the absence of any significant OS benefit from the Phase 2, you would not file under accelerated approval? Then in addition, you made some comment about the manageability of the neutropenia. Actually I have seen that's still the case and the profile hasn't changed from the early patient experience.","Then finally, you retained the rights to both tremelimumab and your anti-CD40 together with use with vaccines. Do you have any vaccines close to entering clinical development in combination with either these two assets? Thank you.","Ian Read","Thank you, Andrew. Look, on palbo, I don't think we can assume anything on the path forward until we see the results and then we will be in conversations with the FDA. As you say, overall survival is event-driven and may take a longer time, but we will just have to wait for the results and have in-depth discussion for the FDA. Mikael, do you want to talk about profile vis-\u00e0-vis neutropenia and also then discuss the tremelimumab and the CD 40?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So the type of profile we have reported, which is very well compatible with what you will see with these type of drugs has been very well manageable in the clinic and it seems to be much more tolerable than previous experience with the drugs in use in solid tumors when it relates to a hematological suppression. So we feel very comfortable with the profile and look forward, as Ian alluded, to see the final results. Clearly, at this stage of development, it's progression-free survival that will be the dominant endpoint to look for.","In the vaccines area, you are right, we retained use for tremelimumab. Particularly, I would like to underline that that antibody is part of the platform we are exploring together with unique prostate vaccine antigens and a very comprehensive delivery method of the vaccine to boost the immune response. Our initial focus is on prostate cancer and we aspire to be in human studies by 2015. At that time point, we would like to see a number of Pfizer cancer immunotherapy approaches move forward based on a panel of different molecular antibodies.","Ian Read","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles Triano","Thanks, Mikael. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays.","Tony Butler - Barclays","Thanks very much. Good morning. Just a brief question. As you, late last year, made references to splitting out the units into three different business units, you focused on Oncology and Vaccines, claiming that there was the need for laser-like focus on these areas because they are clearly growing substantially above the corporate rate. That's clearly understandable. You included consumer at the time and as I seem to recall it was either Frank or you, Ian, made the reference that it was because the manager of the Consumer business would then be the manager of both. Now, that Albert is head of that, does it not now make sense that consumer be split apart, again, because of this laser-like focus on Vaccines and Oncology? Thanks very much.","Ian Read","Thanks, Tony. I think the structure is important, but not overriding. What's overriding is having really good leaders running the Oncology and the Vaccine business, having transparency on their results, having somebody good running Consumer and then having an overall President who has done tremendously good work in the Established Products and the value business and somebody who is a seasoned leader. So I don't really think it's important vis-\u00e0-vis, small tweaks in the structure because of the changes in leaders. But thank you for the question.","Charles Triano","Thank you. Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink","Thanks a lot. Thanks for the questions. Frank, thank you for the incredible detail on the P&L structures. That was great. But separately, you mentioned the staph aureus showing some preliminary evidence of efficacy. Can you just give us maybe a little bit of color as to what you were looking for in terms of the quality of the immune response? So should we anticipate some threshold of real evidence of opsonizing antibodies actually showing, since it's my understanding that that's what's necessary to really eradicate or fight the disease?","Then separately, as we think about some of the products in earlier stages of development, would you mind just maybe giving us a little bit of color as to the products in Phase 2, outside of the products that were mentioned on the call today that might be particularly exciting, particularly as we think about the prospect for combinations in your cancer portfolio? Thanks a lot."," ","Ian Read","Okay. Thank you. Really good questions. So Mikael, you are a popular man today.","Mikael Dolsten","Okay. So thank you very much for the interest in staph aureus vaccine. That's based on some various source of science that we invested in over the last couple of years and we identified four different antigens and both polysaccharide and proteins that we have shown elicit high level of antibodies in each relevant individuals. As you discussed, these induced antibodies, will both induce what you call opsonization, clearance of the antibody by the immune system, but also they will interfere with the bacterial function which is based on some unique science that we have done for this particular vaccine.","We saw very nice levels of induced antibodies, rapid onset with really the profile you would like to see before you vaccinate individuals to go into a surgical environment where there may be threatened with difficult infection. I would like to underline that antibodies cross react with a large majority of staph aureus strains including the multiresistant strains that can cause devastating outcome of hospitalization. So we are very encouraged by the data and we have shared it with both European and U.S. regulators and we are now in dialogues around a Phase 2b study that we will invest in to show event reduction of infection in a pre-surgical population.","Concerning the interest in our Phase 2 pipeline, I would like to underline that we have a rich pipeline with a lot of momentum behind the kind of near-term excitement around Palbociclib and adult vaccine. Just a few highlights. We have started multiple Phase 2 for our smooth inhibitor in blood cancers and related blood disorders, an area that we are very excited about. We are also moving our gamma-secretase inhibitor into triple negative breast cancer where we have seen some very interesting and favorable profile so far.","In the Xalkori space, we are now dosing patients with a full-on drug that is targeting all non-mutations and we think can have a very exciting profile. We have already moved one antibody drug conjugate into the clinic and we have several more that will move into the clinic this year.","In inflammation immunology, we have readouts in this year of our best-in-class IL-6 antibody across numerous immune conditions similar for our Med Chem antibody and also for our small molecule dissociated glucocorticoid receptor. Then in vaccine, we also have noticed favorable Phase 1b data with (inaudible) and then moving forward with one of our formulations towards Phase 2 initiation this year.","And Ian alluded briefly in his introductory remark to some extent that work we are doing into renal diseases, where we have seen a positive Phase 2a data of our novel PDE5 inhibitor. We also have moved a second CCL25 dual inhibitor into diabetic nephropathy and diabetic macular edema underlying the important opportunity, medical and commercial, we see in this disease.","You may also note in some other highlights, including a dual acting inhibitor of uric acid for gout therapy, that we recently acquired through a licensing agreement with Kissei. So I think you will continue to see great momentum with internal and external partnership in this area. Thank you for your interest.","Ian Read","Thank you. Of course, on top of that, we do have Phase 3 Bococizumab and the Xeljanz data coming out and MeningB. So I think it's a strong pipeline across all phases. Thank you, Mikael.","Charles Triano","Next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. Frank, I appreciated all the detail that you provided. I just wanted to follow-up, though, on some potential acquirers of the Established Products business. You have implied or suggested that Pfizer can indeed retroactively audit going backwards. So could you just sort of settle the debate, could you talk about why Pfizer cannot retroactively audit going backwards and just explain whether there is an any gray area there, that would be great. Thanks so much.","Ian Read","Sure.","Frank D'Amelio","So Dave, I mentioned before that three years audited financials and I used the word prospective. The reason I used the word prospective was, if not prospective, then it would have to be some portion of retrospective. Remember, if we are doing something retrospectively, it's not just an income statement, it's also a balance sheet, it\u2019s a cash flow statement and these are businesses that in their new construct didn't exist previously to 2014. So it's the complexity involved in there not existing and the full suite of financial statements required which is why I said prospectively.","Charles Triano","Thanks, Frank, and our last question please operator.","Operator","Your final question comes from Damien Conover from Morningstar.","Damien Conover - Morningstar","Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick questions. First on Eliquis, the Lancet in December published a mid-analysis that looked at the different anticoagulants and really showed little differentiation among them. Obviously, better than warfarin, but I want to get your sense of the marketing efforts and if you are finding ways to market Eliquis and get a better response over Xarelto and Pradaxa?","Then secondly, just a question on the potential breakup of the company. If you look forward to patent losses beyond the breakup, just trying to get an understanding of how assets might stay within companies or shift companies? For example with Lyrica, I think the patent loss is 2019. How would something like that, would that stay with the branded company or would it shift to the established company? I am just trying to get a sense of how that strategy might play out? Thanks.","Ian Read","Thank you. So I will take the second question first and then I will ask Geno to comment on the differentiation and the confidence one can have in mid-analysis and compared to randomized prospective trials. So look, I think the way you see we have set up our divisions now and the transfer of assets is probably similar to what we would do if there was a separation, but it would depend upon what type of separation it was and clearly you have to operate to maximize the value, initially of Pfizer's shareholder at that time and then it either will be commercial considerations on how you ensure that continuing LOEs get well managed by an organization that is capable to maximize it.","So I think your questions is, is all hypothetical this time without knowing exactly how we would, if we do, do any type of break-up with separation. Whether it would be selling to another company or a spin, that would clearly change the nature of the transactions, etcetera, etcetera. So in both your cases, we will be focused on doing what is right for our shareholders and ensuring maximum value.","Geno, do you want to add any comments on?","Geno Germano","Yes. Just a comment on our datasets. Our Eliquis dataset is really an outstanding dataset, a randomized prospective controlled clinical trial demonstrating superiority across three important efficacy and safety endpoints is a extremely strong database. Frankly, having randomized trials with those results is the strongest form of evidence that we could possibly have. What we are doing with that, that's really helping us in a competitive field, is taking it to, frankly, the clinicians that can understand and appreciate the data the best, and that's the specialist, the cardiologist.","We have increased substantially our medical education, our focus on the cardiologist and as a result, we have seen a nice response. In fact, we use as a leading indicator, new-to-brand prescriptions and we are watching new-to-brand prescriptions. This is prescriptions where a patient is getting a new brand. Across all of the business, we are now over 25%, and among cardiologist, we are about 30%, and we have surpassed Pradaxa and we are growing at a more rapid rate than Xarelto. So we think we have got some good momentum going here and it's on the back of the excellent dataset that we have.","Ian Read","Thank you.","Charles Triano","Thank you. Thank you this morning for everyone's attention. Thanks.","Ian Read","So long, everybody. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Pfizer's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"16892":["Pfizer Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Chuck Triano","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance and 2020 financial guidance. I'm joined today by our CEO, and Chairman Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at pfizer.com\/investors. You'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question-and-answer session","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will speak about our performance for the year, the continued advancement of our pipeline and the steps we're taking to position Pfizer for accelerated growth following the expected separation of Upjohn from Pfizer later this year.","Frank will then provide details regarding our fourth quarter performance and our 2020 financial guidance. 2019 was a productive and transformational year for Pfizer, which we generated solid full year financial results. These results were highlighted by exceptional 8% operational revenue growth for the year and the 9% in the fourth quarter for our Biopharma business, which will become the new Pfizer following the expected separation of Upjohn.","Once again, our Biopharmaceutical group, outstanding growth was driven primarily by the continued strong performance from all our key growth drivers. This includes Ibrance, Xtandi, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Vyndaqel among others. Biopharma also generated 14% operational growth in emerging markets in 2019. I would point out that Biopharma's 2019 growth came from volume increases, not pricing. In fact pricing had the negative 2% impact in Biopharma's results.","For full year 2019 global Ibrance revenues increased 23% operationally to become a nearly $5 billion a year product. In the US Ibrance realized robust growth and retained its strong leadership position in the syndicate class with a nearly 90% sale. Ibrance performance outside of the US was also very strong, and we still see significant opportunities in countries where the use of CDK inhibitors has not yet reached the levels seen in the US.","Overall Ibrance is approved in more than 90 countries is the number one prescribed CDK 4\/6 inhibitor globally and has reached more than 250,000 patients. For Xtandi alliance revenues in the US were up 20% for the full year, and when combined with our royalty income on ex-US sales totaled nearly $1.2 billion in 2019.","Xtandi is the leading brand in novel hormone therapy in an increasingly competitive but growing class with 37% market share in total prescriptions. The vast year over year growth was due to continued uptake of the non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer indication as well as prescriber confidence in recognition of Xtandi's strong data gross CRTC.","There is an alarm so far Xtandi indication metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer in the US. Xtandi is now the first and only oral treatment approved by the FDA in three distinct types of prostate cancer. Eliquis continue to perform well. Pfizer serving the global revenues was up 26% operationally to $4.2 billion. This growth was driven primarily by continued increase adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, as well as oral anticoagulant market share gains.","Eliquis is now the oral anticoagulant leader in 12 markets across the globe. Xeljanz had a strong performance with global revenues increasing 29% operationally to $2.2 billion. We are very pleased with the continued positive uptake across all indications, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. And we continue to launch psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis in new markets.","Looking at our disease business, Vyndaqel continues to ramp up nicely in the US following the May 2019 approval and launch for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy. Overall, this first of its kind medicine contributed for having $73 million in revenue in 2019. Our disease awareness efforts helped drive the diagnosis rate to 9% by the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 1% prior to launch.","As of the end of 2019 more than 9,000 patients have been diagnosed, more than 5,500 patients have received the prescription for Vyndaqel and more than 3,000 patients have received the drug. These numbers do not include approximately hundred patients who are still in the early access program.","Global Prevnar 13 revenues were up 3% operationally to $5.8 billion. The US CDC also published its updated recommendation for immune-competent adults age 65 and older to cert clinical decision making in the November morbidity and mortality weekly report, highlighting that a patient concern the decision to vaccinate with PCV 13 with a physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner or pharmacist.","Looking at our sterile injectibles portfolio, our focus on manufacturing recovery is taking shape and beginning to have a positive impact on the top line in the US. We have made solid progress with remediation and modernization and expect continued improvement throughout 2020. Of note, while global revenue from our sterile injectables portfolio declined 1% operationally for the full year, it increased 5% operationally during the fourth quarter.","Additionally, more than 80% of our injectibles portfolio is in stock today. And we anticipate this percentage will continue to increase in 2020. Our global biosimilars portfolio grew 22% operationally to $911 million for the full year. This was driven largely by 70% growth in the US, thanks to the launch of Retacrit and a gradual uptake of Inflectra.","The growth in the US was partially offset by decline in international markets driven mainly by Inflectra. We expect an additional contribution from biosimilars in 2020 with the launch of three oncology monoclonal antibody biosimilars. Last week, we announced the launches of [indiscernible] in the US market, and next month we expect to launch Trazimera. All three products will be available at a substantially discounted price compared with the originator products.","Full year revenue for our Upjohn business were down 16% operationally to $10.2 billion. The key headwind during the year was the advent of generic competition on Lyrica in the US, which is partially offset by 7% operational growth in China. The growth in China was driven primarily by Viagra and Celebrex, as well as Lipitor in non-reimbursed channels, which constitute significant market share in China.","We are making good progress with a pre-integration planning for Upjohn's proposed combination with Mylan, which remains on track for mid-2020. In December, we announced that former Pfizer Chairman Ian Read and current Pfizer Director James Kilts will join the Viatris Board of Directors upon completion of the transaction. We are also working closely with our counterparts of Mylan on the CFO selection process.","We expect to announce the appointments of both the CFO and the third director by the end of this quarter. We have great confidence in Viatris, which will combine Upjohn's strong commercial capabilities and iconic brands with Mylan's terrific pipeline.","Turning now to R&D, we remain very pleased with the progress we are making with our pipeline. We are expecting key clinical results in 2020, several of which have the potential to make this an exciting year for patients hoping for new treatment options. We anticipate setting data from up to 15 proof of concept readouts, with contributions from all our therapeutic areas as well as up to 10 pivotal study starts and five key pivotal study readouts.","I will now highlight some of those expected events. We continue to expect our two event driven Ibrance early breast cancer programs, Penelope B, and powers to read out in late 2020 and early 2021 respectively. If successful, and following regulatory approval, these programs could double the number of patients eligible to benefit from Ibrance.","The Phase 2 open label single arm ANCHOR CRC study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi and cetuximab in patients with previously untreated BRAFv600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer is currently ongoing. Results from the study will be submitted for presentation at the Medical Congress in the second half of 2020.","For abrocitinib, our investigational JAK-1 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, we look forward to sharing top line findings from the Phase 3 JADE compared trial in the coming months. Pending successful conclusion of the core Phase 3 studies regulatory submission in the U.S. is projected for the third quarter of 2020 with subsequent markets following later in the year.","This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib or dupilumab placebo in adults on background medicated topical therapy with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The study also has a key secondary endpoint, but it is designed to assess the effect on each severity of abrocitinib compared with dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis on background topical therapy.","There are up to five proof of concept readouts expected in 2020 from our industry leading immune-kinase pipeline. Our hope is to advance several of this into Phase 3 trials. This include TYK2 JAK-1 with potential POC readouts for psoriatic arthritis and for topical formulation for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as in oral JAK-3 tech for Vitiligo, and oral TYK2 for psoriasis.","This is a great example of our unique strategy to purposefully match and molecule to a disease, where we think it has the potential to make the most difference, as well as the formulation that we believe has the potential to treat milder forms of disease. Our gene therapy platform is advancing with promising Phase 1\/2 Haemophilia A data that is expected to support the Phase 3 start this year.","This would be our second gene therapy pivotal study following the ongoing Haemophilia B Phase 3 study. In addition, our DMD gene therapy program is gathering additional robust patient data building on the progress research at the current project Muscular Dystrophy conference last June. We are preparing for an expected POC in the first half of 2020 and the Phase 3 pivotal study start in second half of this year.","We look forward to successfully completing the Phase 3 studies for our investigational 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in adults and remain on track to submit the biologics license application to the FDA by the end of this year. Pfizer's candidate represents a potential significant advancement compared with a potential 15-valent.","If successful in Phase 3 and approved the five additional serotypes may provide coverage against approximately 33% more strains that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in adults and 42% more strains causing the disease in infants in the United States. For our maternal vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus RSV, we are preparing for an expected POC in the second quarter of 2020, followed by potentially swift progression to Phase 3.","We look forward to sharing more updates on our pipeline during our upcoming investor day on March 31. In summary, we finished 2019 with strong momentum, and we look forward to continuing that momentum in 2020. During the year we generated a solid financial performance, further advanced our strong R&D pipeline and took bold actions to reshape Pfizer into an innovation powerhouse that will build on our legacy of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives.","Now, I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2020. Frank?","Frank D'Amelio","Thanks, Albert. Good day everyone. Now moving on to the financials, fourth quarter 2019 revenues were $12.7 billion down 8% operationally versus the year ago quarter. Excluding the impact of the Consumer Healthcare business revenue was down 1% operationally.","Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business revenues were $10.5 billion up 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter with strong operational growth in Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel and a second straight quarter of operational growth for our hospital business, including our sterile injectables.","Revenues for our Upjohn business in the fourth quarter decreased 32% operationally to $2.2 billion with the primary year-over-year impact again being a generic competition for Lyrica in the US that began in July of 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the US and other recent product losses of exclusivity, fourth quarter 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 6% operationally.","I know Upjohn's business in China has been an area of focus and fourth quarter revenues for Upjohn declined 1% operationally. We saw the expected revenue declines for Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces where the volume based procurement program has been implemented and these declines were mostly offset by operational growth from products, not impacted by the VBP program, including Celebrex and Viagra.","Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was favorably impacted by the July completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Lyrica loss of exclusivity.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $0.06 loss per share on a GAAP basis, which primarily due to a $2.6 billion asset impairment charge for Eucrisa and restructuring purchase accounting and legal charges. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.55 versus $0.63 in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues again, mainly due to the Lyrica LOE in the US and higher operating expenses.","I want to point out the diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 281 million shares compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018 and 2019 and partially offset by dilution related to share based employee compensation programs. Finally, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $158 million or 1% on fourth quarter 2019 revenues and a $0.03 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter.","As you can see on the chart our 9% operational growth in the Biopharma business was driven by strong performance by Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xtandi, Vyndaqel, and Inlyta.","Moving on to 2019 financial guidance, as you can see on the chart, we met or exceeded all components of our 2019 financial guidance. Now, I want to highlight how our 2020 guidance compares to 2019 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. Starting on the left side of the slide. Our 2019 results reflect partial year contributions from the consumer healthcare business segment, which we deconsolidated in the third quarter of 2019.","Excluding $2.1 billion in revenues generated from the consumer healthcare business segment, total company 2019 revenues were $49.7 billion and 2019 adjusted diluted EPS is $2.95.","For 2020, the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflects Pfizer share of the Consumer Healthcare's joint venture's earnings that were generated in fourth quarter 2019 and will be reported in first quarter 2020 along with Pfizer share of the JV's anticipated earnings for the first three quarters of 2020.","As you can see, the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range for revenues implies comparable performance to 2019 Revenues after excluding the partial year contribution from Consumer Healthcare, as well as an anticipated $200 million favorable impact from foreign exchange based on mid-January 2020 rates compared to last year. Despite an anticipated $2.4 billion and LOE headwinds in 2020 we expect the midpoint of the revenue range to remain flat operationally excluding consumer healthcare.","Now let's go through the full details of our 2020 financial guidance for total company. As we've said, we are expecting the close of the transaction between our Upjohn businesses and Mylan to be completed in mid-2020. So we are providing three sets of guidance. First, total company, which reflects our current construct of the Biopharma and Upjohn businesses and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan.","Second, new Pfizer, which is a full year pro forma view that reflects the impact of the pending fee interest transaction by removing Upjohn and including $12 billion in cash proceeds from Upjohn to new Pfizer and other transaction related factors such as transitional service agreement revenue.","And third Upjohn as a standalone business, all of these scenarios are based on a full year of revenues and expenses in 2020. Beginning with total company 2020, revenue guidance of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion reflects anticipated continued strong momentum in our Biopharma business, primarily offset by the continued negative impact of product clauses of exclusivity in our Upjohn business, primarily Lyrica in the US.","Moving on to other elements of our 2020 financial guidance for total company, compared with 2019 actual results, the midpoints of these ranges imply higher adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the continued impact from the Lyrica LOE, higher adjusted r&d expenses and higher adjusted other income, which reflects earnings from the consumer healthcare joint venture.","And lower adjusted R&E expenses and adjusted diluted EPS. In 2020 financial guidance for adjusted EPS assumes no new share repurchases, and we will focus instead on increasing the dividend and investing in the business during this period of growth. As a result, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $5.65 billion shares, which is approximately the same as 2019.","Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer for the full year 2020, we now anticipate full year 2020 revenues between $40.7 and $42.3 billion, with the midpoint of the guidance range representing 8% operational growth compared to 2019 Biopharma revenues, excluding Meridian and Mylan, Japan, and an improvement from our initial July targets.","This guidance range excludes $600 million of contributions from Meridian, Pfizer's subsidiary and manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto injector products, as well as from the strategic collaboration with Mylan, in Japan for the development, manufacturing and marketing of generic medicines.","Due to an organizational realignment both of these assets have shifted to Upjohn effective at the start of 2020. Both Meridian and Mylan Japan will be reported in Pfizer's Upjohn business beginning in first quarter 2020. We now anticipate full year 2020 adjusted IBT as percentage of revenue of approximately 37%.","Also an improvement from July, we anticipate the midpoint of the guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS to be to $2.30. The operating cash flow guidance range remains approximately $11 to $12 billion. This EPS guidance reflects the $12 billion cash that Pfizer will receive upon the close of the combination of Upjohn-Mylan which will be used to pay down debt during 2020.","As you can see the midpoints for new Pfizer's 2020 revenue and adjusted IBT margin guidance have improved materially since our preliminary 2020 projections were present in July in conjunction with the announcement of the proposed Mylan and Upjohn combination. We have provided a bridge from our initial July targets to this current guidance on the bottom of the chart for clarity.","Upon the close of the Mylan Upjohn combination and once we become new Pfizers you can expect the same level of detail in our 2020 guidance that we provided today for total company. Moving on to 2020 financial guidance for Upjohn for the full year 2020 we anticipate revenues of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, reflecting the continued negative impact of losses of exclusivity for products such as Lyrica in US which began facing multisource generic competition in July 2019 and the expansion of the volume based procurement program in China. And reflecting the inclusion of revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan Japan.","We anticipate full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA for the Upjohn business of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion other than the inclusion of revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan Japan there are already no operational changes to Upjohn's 2020 financial guidance compared with preliminary financial targets provided in July of 2019. Again, we have provided a bridge from our initial July targets to this current guidance at the bottom of the chart.","Moving on to key takeaways regarding 2019, we delivered a strong fourth quarter with our Biopharma business growing 9% operationally, which represents our go forward business after the pending combination of Upjohn and Mylan. We provided 2020 guidance ranges for total company new Pfizers and Upjohn importantly.","We are projecting strong organic revenue growth for new Pfizers in 2020. We accomplished key product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update. And we returned $16.9 billion to shareholders in 2019 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond.","Now I turn it back to Chuck.","Chuck Triano","Thanks Frank and Albert for those remarks. At this time operator, can we please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.","Randall Stanicky","Great. Thanks, guys, for the questions. I've two, one for Albert and one for Angela. Albert a couple weeks ago, you called out $4.5 billion in enabling cost within SI&A [ph] with an opportunity to simplify. So how do we think about the cost savings opportunity after you close Upjohn in terms of number one, how much incremental cost savings do you see beyond was built into the 37% margin? And then number two, how much of that could hit back half 2020 versus 2021. And then I have a follow-up after that for Angela.","Albert Bourla","Okay. I think you should, - how can he ask question to Angela, she can get back, okay. So indeed we have this year approximately $14.3 billion of SI&A and front we were on the number in more details. And as I said 4.5 approximately is what we call enabling funds. So these are sanctions like finance, legal facilities that we are facilitating and enabling the core functions of our business to perform.","Core functions I mean are discovering the products, manufacturing that is making them happen and commercial but it is making them available to the patients. We do believe that this $4.5 billion actually have approximately 10,000 people can be improved. And we have plans to dissolve. In the current guidance and to comment there is part, a small part of that, cost opportunity saving, already incorporated and in 2021, will be about to get back, so Frank.","Frank D'Amelio","So Randall just let me run the number which is if you look at 2019 actual SI&A for example, we spent about $14 billion as a company. Obviously that $4.5 billion that Albert alluded to in that $14 billion. If you look at our 2020 guidance for SI&A the range is $12 billion to $13 billion, midpoints $12.5 billion. $12.5 billion from $14 billion is a decline of $1.5 billion, roughly half of that is consumer.","Because, we went from consolidating consumer to equity accounting on consumer once the deal closed in July 31, 2019. The remaining half is really operational savings across the company, including part of the - including some of the $4.5 billion that Albert alluded to. And that obviously help contribute to the IBT as a percentage of revenue, improving from 35 - from the mid-30s to 37%.","And then to Albert's point, obviously, what we're doing now is working on further improvements that would obviously positively impact the SI&A, and that would flow to the bottom line.","Chuck Triano","Great, thanks Albert and Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much for the question. Just had three quick product ones. The first was on Vyndaqel. Seems like a nice step up in all your patient metrics seems like, although it's basically doubled or tripled from 3Q. Can you help bridge those figures with the sequential sales ramp we saw which wasn't quite as dramatic?","The second question was on Ibrance. Just elaboration there in terms of what drove the revised timelines for PALACE. And have you taken another interim look at the data at this point. And then finally on tanezumab. Just an update in terms of what the status and outlook is for that product at this point? Thanks so much.","Albert Bourla","Very good. Thank you very much. I will ask Angela to address the Vyndaqel and tanezumab questions. And then I will say a few words about Ibrance. And maybe I will ask Mikael to chime in, please.","Angela Hwang","So thanks for the question. And certainly we are pleased with the increased diagnosis prescription as well as the numbers of patients that are receiving Vyndaqel. As you said, our diagnosis now is up to about 9%. The ability for patients to receive prescriptions up to about 64% of those that are diagnosed and those that are receiving medications are around 35% of those that are diagnosed.","So every quarter since we've been reporting this, we've been seeing some nice increases. So, we certainly pleased with that. I think in terms just the sort of the commensurate alignment with the actual net sales numbers, I think that there are obviously there - every single day there is a dynamic situation. And the number and the proportion of patients, whether they are Medicare and commercial lives, those are changing. And so the gross to net of those are going to affect I think, what you see on a net sales basis.","So, I think that, we are watching and really focused on driving diagnosis and ensuring that as many patients can get on these drugs as possible. And we're starting to see some really nice pickup. But I think that is still a very dynamic situation because we're really relatively new in this process. So we'll continue to monitor and should expect to see some, quarter to quarter changes in terms of net sales.","Albert Bourla","And obviously the new patients that are contributing disproportionately because they are in fewer months of treatment in terms of sales.","Angela Hwang","Right. And then your second question was on tanezumab. So we're really pleased that in December of 2019, we completed our U.S. submission of tanezumab. And we are also pursuing regulatory submissions in the EU and in Japan. This submission was done in close collaboration with the FDA and it includes the 2.5 milligrams in moderate to severe osteoarthritis patients.","So at this moment in time we're waiting acceptance of this filing, but we see significant potential of tanezumab and osteoarthritis. So we're really excited about this filing. And particularly because we're in a time where non-opioid solutions are very, very much needed for these patients. If you look at the market potential today, there are about 27 million Americans that suffer from osteoarthritis and 11 million of those have moderate to severe OA.","80% of those 11 million people have tried and failed three or more analgesics. So that tells us that there is just a huge amount of unmet need in this patient population. Patients are cycling through a number of pain, pain medications. And there just is an incredible need for new options. And this is where we think tanezumab can really fill an unmet need. It has the potential to become the first in class non-opioid treatment for these patients. And we eagerly await the acceptance of this file from the FDA.","Albert Bourla","Thank you. Now let me address the question on Ibrance. The expected completion of the study slept a little bit few weeks actually. It was at the end of the '19, excuse me the end of '20 and now it's moved into the very beginning of '21. The only reason of this is that the events are not coming at the pace that we had forecasted, didn't expect it.","So, now that means people are not progressing into their disease. I don't think we can draw any conclusions, if that means good news or bad news, I think it's just facts of the data. We don't know if the people aren't progressing equally in the two arms or they're progressing in the treatment. That remains to be seen when we unblind the date.","As regards your question, if there was an interim analysis, there was not an interim analysis. So we haven't seen any interim analysis. There will be an interim analysis, but we do not expect that the most likely scenario is that the study will continue when this interim analysis comes.","The study was designed to come to full completion. And the criteria that we have set to stop for efficacy in the interim study are very, very high. So it's not impossible, but this will happen. But most likely scenario, it is that as we had planned that the study will come to completion. At the end of it, this is what will happen. But we are very - we still remain very, very encouraged and optimistic about Ibrance.","Of course, it's a Phase 3, you never know what will be. But all the signs behind it is supporting that we could have a positive outcome. And I will ask actually, Mikael, to make a few comments on the science and to what does this mean?","Mikael Dolsten","I guess punctuate, a few things that Albert described so well. Four aspect of why we are, very excited and optimistic about the science and clinical data to predict a potential positive outcome for the discuss PALACE study. As you know, first of all that the CDK 4\/6 inhibitor Ibrance convert with estrogen receptor drugs to stop cancer cells or breast cancer cells to divide.","We've shown that in the [indiscernible] 2 and 3 studies, and more recently we reported that we could reproduce a data direction in real world evidence based on real world data from [indiscernible] and other databases. And this noteworthy including also overall survival data, again, showing in medical practice importance of these drugs.","Three, the pilot study that looked at the ability publicity Ibrance to stop dividing of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer showed that this mechanism was very well operating in a powerful way. And finally, let me remind you that other agents that act on estrogen receptor positive breast cancers and convert with the power cycling such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, all were initially developed in metastatic cancer and did very well in element treatment in early breast cancer.","So these four observations in adults, make us continue to be excited and very optimistic. And as Albert alluded to relatively small change in projected trial is based on a trial that actually started 4.5 years ago. And it is quite common that in the final 12 months or so, minor changes in enrollment rate, and process planning for study reports can affect trial. But we'd all obvious, you can hear, we remain encouraged enthusiasts about what Ibrance can offer for element treatment to breast cancer.","Chuck Triano","Right. Thanks for the helpful context, Mikael. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two product ones for me; I was wondering, if you can talk about Ibrance rest of world dynamics, any specific headwinds this quarter? And how to think about the trajectory into this year? And then for Xeljanz, I was wondering if you can give us a split of sales by indication and if you're seeing any impact in RA from the launch of AbbVie's RINVOQ on either share price? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very, very much. So, Angela?","Angela Hwang","Sure. So, first of all, Ibrance. We continue to see good growth and strong growth ex-U.S., but probably 2 factors that are tempering the net sales, as you saw in Q4. The first is pricing and that continues to be something that we work hard at especially in the EU to gain access for our products in Europe. And the second is class growth. So you look at the class growth of the CDK class through the quarters that has increased but over the last quarter it has tempered.","And it's sort of sitting at around a 35% as CDK class growth right now, cross share. But within that the Ibrance still has a very, very high product share in the 80's. So I think its pointing out to us the fact that there is still opportunity for us to grow and growing the CDK class is going to be an area of tremendous focus for us ex US in 2020 and beyond.","Your second question was around Xeljanz. And so Xeljanz again we continue to see excellent growth in Xeljanz. In fact, despite the fact that you only see this sort of 1% net sales growth in Q4 I will point out that globally full year we had 29% growth of Xeljanz which is one of the highest of all of our core brands here at Pfizer our entire portfolio.","Q4 we saw 23% prescription growth and this prescription growth was driven by extremely strong performance in rheumatoid arthritis which really was not impacted by the label changes. And we still continue to see strong growth in ulcerative colitis even though here was the biggest label change, and so physicians did have to adjust the way that they were prescribing Xeljanz.","But we expect this growth to continue because we have excellent momentum and confidence in prescribing from our physicians. We have significant unmet need and we have greatly improved access. And this access is in fact what drove the 1% net sales in Q4. There was - in Q4 of '18 we saw an inventory build at the end of the year which didn't happen in Q4 of '19.","So that was one of the reasons that affected our Q4 performance in '19. And then also more importantly throughout the course of 2019 we gained significant access. In fact we added 59 million incremental lives through contracting.","And it's because of the timing of when these contracts were signed or renewed that drove the subsequent impact of rebates. And this sort of came to ahead and sort of disproportionately affected us in Q4 of '19. So I think stepping back we're really pleased with the access that we do have in Xeljanz. And since it was launched eight years ago this is the most favorable access situation that we ever had which is very important when it comes to ability to compete with RINVOQ.","You asked the question around RINVOQ, just to sort of put into prospective I think that we're excited about having another competitor help drive the growth of the Jack class in all of our indications. That being said Xeljanz still enjoys a lion, a leading market share especially in RA where we have more than 15% of the market share of the entire class.","Albert Bourla","Great, thank you very much Angela. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, Albert, if I may, what you hearing on a possible upcoming rule on IPI? There is a lot of press that companies have been notified by White House. I was curious what you know about it and is there something we should be very concerned about?","Mikael one quick one for you on the DMD gene therapy for a minute, you mentioned there is a proof of concept coming. My question is have there been additional protocol driven positive enrollment. And I asked because recall when the first SA when the kidney injury happened the trial was paused and I'm curious has anything like that happened again.","And then finally, Frank maybe just quickly on SI&A line. I know little higher than consensus but technically year-over-year versus 4Q18 it was not much higher, but I also realized Q418 has some consumer, maybe you could tell us about your holiday party. Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Alright, so let me start with the IPI, we have not received any notification on that. So there is not news from our side other than what we read, don't know with respect. So, Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. Just to remind you, we shared at the PPMD conference meet of last year update on six patients dosed with our DMD gene therapy that showed encouraging data on expression muscle fibers amounted micro dystrophin. And on some of the patients we had also an opportunity to report the encouraging trends on functional outcomes.","We have dosed additional patients since then. And we continue to get experience on efficacy and safety and clinical management that are incorporated in the procedures how we manage these patients going forward. We plan to conclude Phase 2 this spring. And based on current data and insights, we are planning to start Phase 3, of course, pending regulatory dialogues later this year, as indicated in Albert's opening remarks.","Albert Bourla","All right, Frank, maybe you want to tell us about the holiday party, I was not being aware.","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. Yes, I wasn't invited either. Some of you who was in the party. Let me run the numbers and I'll explain what happened. So for the quarter, SI&A was about $4.1 billion, it was up about 4% operationally $100 million give or take from the prior year quarter.","What really drove that was increased investment behind some of our brands, some of oncology products, some of our launch products like Vyndaqel, and some increased investment in emerging markets. But it was really investment in terms of being part of supporting our brands.","Albert Bourla","Yeah, thank you, Mikael. And just to make a comment, we are very, very diligent in that way that we allocate capital. And we are - when we have opportunities to put in promotional money so we can have a very strong stock, we do it. And we take those money usually, by being very diligent in the way that we control the indirect expense.","I have been very clear, about indirect is a very clear distinction in our mind. So when it comes to things, that there are overheads and things that they are not affecting directly, the business results, we are very, very tough. And when it comes to areas that the investments can affect business results, we are creative and generous. So that's what you saw here.","Frank D'Amelio","And these are clearly direct expenses.","Albert Bourla","And these are all direct expense. The same by the way, although you didn't ask comes to R&D. Right now we are increasing R&D investments. But we are increasing R&D investments only for programs only for projects, we are not increasing infrastructure, not increasing the research centers. At large we maintain a very strong presence there and we keep that very strong. But what is driving the increase R&D it is more Phase 3 or Phase 2 studies, is very clear.","Chuck Triano","Right. Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. So, I have three questions, please. First, Albert, could you discuss why Pfizer decided not to repurchase shares in 2020? And then maybe Frank, you can comment about - comment on how we should think about the EPS implications when we consider your guidance relative to consensus, which had assumed some share repurchase?","Second, regarding the opportunity to rationalize the $4.5 billion in costs, can you just give us a sense for what percentage reduction is reasonable to assume a few years out, I was guessing maybe 20%, but I just don't know what's reasonable?","And then third, regarding the transfer of $600 million in revenue to Upjohn, does that change the economics that Pfizer will receive as part of the exit to Mylan? Thanks.","Albert Bourla","Yes. And I think basically all questions can be answered by Frank, I will just make some introductory comments. The reason why, capital allocation, we are allocating right now money to increase the dividend and also to invest in our business or the OpEx to modernize our facility or the CapEx to modernize our facilities. The reason why we don't do right now share repurchases is because we want to make sure that we maintain very strong, hard power to invest in the business.","The past was a very different Pfizer, the past of the last decade had to deal with declining of revenues, constant declining of revenues. And we had to do what you had to do, even if it was financial engineering, with purchasing back ourselves. We couldn't invest them and create higher value. Now is a very different situation.","We are a very different company, the company is going to have best-in-class top line growth revenue story, starting from nothing the separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year from the expected separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year. And we do not need, we can organically grow EPS, as you can see all our predictions on EPS this year are organically no share repurchases. But you can use the capital to invest in goods Phase 2, Phase 3 assets that could build our pipeline. So this is the strategy behind it.","Now let me ask Frank to run the numbers.","Frank D'Amelio","So David, all I'll do is I don't want to duplicate anything, Albert said. I'll just add a couple of things on the share repurchases. One, we also announced the dividend increase in December. So obviously, we continue to deploy capital in the area of dividends, which we think is important to our investment thesis. And that's something obviously as we go forward, we'll continue to look at.","And then obviously, our 2020 guidance assumes no repurchases. So when you look at the improvement, which was material in terms of the midpoint, versus what we did back in July, none of that is coming from share repurchases.","Let me ask you another couple of questions, on the $600 million transfer to Upjohn and does that change any economics? Let me kind of - let me give some context on this, which is one nothing's been decided yet. We are still in negotiations with Mylan on those two businesses and whether or not they will transfer to Beatrice upon close.","If we don't come to an agreement, those businesses would remain with new Pfizer. And so we're still in negotiations. And so in terms of the economics, I'd say more to come still to be determined. And if and when we complete that, obviously, I'll be in a better position to answer that. On the $4.5 billion of indirect spend. And, directionally, what do we think we can do there?","I don't want to give a specific percentage because we're still working our way through the process. But I think I alluded to this earlier, which is we've already made some nice headway. I think we can make additional headway that additional headway would show up in SI&A. And obviously our intent would be for that to show up in the IVT's percentage of revenue line.","So that's what we're going to do. Our intent is to improve upon those numbers. And as we work our way through the process and as we have more to report we'll make sure we do so.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Frank. And just a comment on the reasons why we transfer those business to Upjohn. Both of these businesses, first of all, they fit more under Upjohn in terms of the dynamics that they have. So they can be managed much better. And secondly, I think they fit very nicely with Mylan. Because one it is the EpiPen predominantly business that Mylan is - but right now is set between the Mylan. We are providing for them.","And the second it is the partnership that we have with Mylan that was established years back and with generics in Japan. So both of them fit much better in [indiscernible]. And that's the reason why we separated. And also that will allow you to have in case that this happened a much more cleaner view of growth trajectory of the company. Because now you know exactly what would be the P&L of the remaining company.","Chuck Triano","Thank you. Next question, please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So I had a few. My first question is a 6%, approximately 6% five years sales CAGR for standalone Pfizer, the new Pfizer still hold? Second question I had is how much of a priority is M&A for you under the new Pfizer? And what kind of size of deals or types of deals are you most interested in?","And last question I have is on the PCV data set that's coming through. You and a competitor also have a whole set of PCV data. I'm just curious how you see that landscape evolving over time. Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Yeah, thank you very, very much, Louise. Let me start with a 6% CAGR. If it still holds up, some of them still holds. So it's actually as you can see if anything else, this business was projecting five years. All the words 25 actually CAGR also 6%. This year performed 8%, 9% for the quarter and we are projecting 8% for 2020. So definitely we are on good - let's say the way to achieve that.","As regards the M&A. Yes, the M&A is a very important part of our strategy. And as I just alluded before, this is why also we are not diluting our firepower with stock purchase right now. Because we do believe that we can create significant value with the right strategic moves.","Now, we never say never to anything, but strategically we've have made very clear that we are not interesting for a big M&A that will have cost synergies as value driver. Because first of all that will be like diluted in our top line growth. I don't think there are many companies that they can have this type of growth trajectory that we have the next few years.","Secondly it could be destructive. Because having a big M&A means that the thousands of people will have to work on integrations rather than supporting all these products that we just saw that they're growing 20s and 30s. And also all this pipeline that is coming up. So this - we never say never but this is not our strategy.","Our strategy for M&A it is to be able to have Phase 2, Phase 3 programs priority Phase 2 Phase 3, which could be become potential medicines in the period '25, '26, '27, '28 so that we can augment our internal pipeline and be able to maintain the 6% growth for the long term, actually, for the very, very long term because it's right now five years I would say it's so long term.","And the other thing that I want to emphasize is that the 6% CAGR, it is risk adjusted. I repeat, it is a risk adjusted. That means that in our projections, we are adjusting all the non-read studies right now appropriate. Now, if all the Phase 3 goals and the right way and they are all successful, it's not going to be 6%, it is going to be double this will be 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%.","Now, if everything fails, also will not be 6% will be very low. But if statistics works and the studies, let's say at 50% more or less are successful. That means that we will achieve 6%. That's why I want to emphasize that there is no binary event in our projections. Binary event would be if that 6% was dependent or two or three major regards that if they could go one way or another could affect. Right now they are dependent on 15, 16, 17 blockbusters. And then many other but they're much small.","So then Frank may be something to add to that before I asked Mikael to comment on PCV data.","Frank D'Amelio","Louise the only thing I wanted to add just to punctuate everything Albert said is and why are we focusing on Phase 2b, Phase 3 is because the Eloise really start to kick in in 2027. So if you think about it, we're in January of 2020, we literally have eight years to work our way through this problem. And by the way, given that kind of a timeframe, given the breath and strength of our pipeline, given our balance sheet, our capacity, obviously we feel confident we will be able to solve.","Albert Bourla","Mikael.","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. I'm pleased that you asked about our pluma next generation. So as you know, we have adult and pediatric studies ongoing. The adult study has been given breakthrough designation in 2018 September based on our incarnating Phase 2 data, and we expect very soon to report Phase 3 outcome of the adult piece of the 20 trial.","And obviously we are optimistic about that outcome based on the Phase 2 and the breakthrough designation. On the pediatric we have now accumulated further past for those data of the PCV 20 Phase 2 study. These data from the first does further substantiate the positive data reported in the press release of to those adults.","And we expect initiation of Phase 2 Phase 3 soon for the infant vaccine, pending discussions with regulators. The full data set will be presented at the major vaccine related conference likely mid of this year. Now, Albert commented also in his introduction very nicely on the improved relative coverage of the PCV 20 from us versus a potential competitor [indiscernible]. And he mentioned 33% better coverage for adults and 42% better coverage in the US for infants.","Obviously, very important, significant, better coverage. I just want you to punctuate when you look in the top European market, similar that improved coverage in adults is actually 60% to 100%; in infants 80% to 200%. This is all for invasive pneumococcal disease. Also in US We have analyzed for community acquired pneumonia, where we see substantial better coverage for the 20 versus a potential 50 inhibitor.","So all in all you can see, we look forward to data sets advancing the program and think it would be the premier 20 valence and premier pneumococcal vaccine for patients. Thank you.","Chuck Triano","Next question, please. Operator?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a few questions. An increase in the dividend was mentioned twice. But it sounds as though Upjohn will be spun not split, in which case the dividend will be reduced. So I'm wondering if you could clarify the dividend comment. And I assume the 2020 EPS guidance implies a spin not a split.","Secondly, on the ever abrocitinib versus Dupixent study, given the fact that it is completed, Mikael, I'm wondering if the data met the very positive portrayal you provided on the Q3 call, which included superior it's released to Dupixent. And then lastly, will the proof of concept DMD data be presented at the March 31 meeting? Thank you very much.","Albert Bourla","Now, thank you very much Steve very good question. So, Frank, why don't you clarify once more the dividend?","Frank D'Amelio","Sure. So Steve, in terms of the guidance, you're right, it assumes a spin, not a split. And then in terms of the dividend, you said, I think you said in your question, it'd be a reduction. I don't see it that way. What we've said is the sum of [indiscernible] dividend and our dividend would equal the current dividend that a Pfizer should receive today.","So I don't see a reduction in the dividend. The dividend income will be kept hold. I think we've been very clear about that all along?","Albert Bourla","And we will continue growing? Maybe not at the same pace which we do right now it's $0.02 per quarter but we continue growing.","Frank D'Amelio","And Steve, I can quickly run the numbers for you if you'd like. Just so you think what [indiscernible] has said is their first full year of about $4 billion of free cash flow, they pay about 25% of that in the dividend. So that's a billion. Total [indiscernible] will have about 1.2 billion shares, you put the 1 billion over 1.2 billion shares, it's about $0.8. The exchange ratio is 1.2 billion.","You put 100 shares of Pfizer you get 12 shares of [Indiscernible] assuming a spin. That's roughly $10 a share. We would reduce our dividend on an annual basis by that $10 but the sum of our dividend plus that $10 and - that $0.10 I'm sorry - thank you. Would equal what the Pfizer you all gets today. In my thing, it's $10. $10 - not 10 cents.","Albert Bourla","Abrocitinib?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. So, thank you for your interest in abrocitinib. And, we believe that it's going to be a new drug class for such a prevalent disease that affects 10s of millions of Americans atopic dermatitis. And where an oral alternative seems to be a real patient and physician preference. We will soon report out the data from the important compared study.","So I haven't actually seen the data. So I can only punctuate a little bit what we discussed at earlier investor meetings that the historical comparison between abrocitinib and Dupixent suggests that we should expect to see a similar or better impact and clear in skin. And particularly as Albert alluded to in his introduction, there is an important key secondary endpoint, looking at each itch relief starting with a readout already of two weeks and then following the study through the 12 to 16 weeks.","And, historical data suggests that we should be very optimistic about abrocitinib outperforming biological, such as Dupixent on itch relief at earlier time points and provide the potential benefit of early onset of relief for disease. Now, we have to wait for the data to be able to, obviously be absolutely confident in that outcome. But this is what I believe and look forward very much to see the data come shortly.","Albert Bourla","And on the DMD question?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, we are finalizing I think the program for the R&D date. So I can't be absolutely promise you, but I think it's likely that such an interesting program as the DMD gene therapy will be one of the potential agenda items. And obviously, we would like to then share updates from increased number of patients over a longer time period. So please welcome and take a front row seat.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much to both. And by the way, Frank as always was right. It's $10 for 12 shares for Mylan.","Chuck Triano","All right. So we'll move on to our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just have a couple, Mikael, on gene therapy platform with the advancement of hemophilia A and B, as well as DMD into Phase 3. What's the capacity to add additional indications to the portfolio? I mean, you guys have been successful partnering, but at this point, it does seem like you could expand the platform organically in a material way.","And then for Angela on Xtandi, I just wanted to get your perspective on the inroads you've made in M0 prostate patients. And what you think could represent a tipping point commercially, especially given that generic XYTIGA available in the U.S.? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yes. So Geoff, we are enthusiasts for the gene therapy platform. And what is particularly I think, a strategic advantage for us is the end to end capability from discovery, clinical manufacturing. And of course, that capability also linked to important external partners. That gives us capacity to advance increasing number of internal as well as partner programs.","And we have an option for the Wilson disease program that, could in a relatively near term future be available for clinical studies. And we expect from internal and external initiative to aspire to about bringing one new gene therapy into the clinic every year or so for the next period to come. And we think that should build up a very comprehensive gene therapy portfolio.","There's the three programs you alluded to of course, the frontier for us, with Factor 9 that we hope to be the first company bringing that over the finish line in Phase 3 now and to start the additional two Phase 3s for we may what we think we have a best-in-class profile so far. And then we already spoke about DMD.","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much. Angela.","Angela Hwang","Sure. So in terms of the M0 the non-metastatic CRPC, I mean, what we're seeing here is, just tremendous growth and tremendous performance. Just broadly speaking, in terms of Xtandi we had a great quarter. We grew 29% and this was driven by two things. One was actually a demand across both metastatic as well as non-metastatic, but also what we saw was the continued expansion of the actual class, the novel hormone therapies, and in this class, Xtandi has the lion's share. We have about 35% share right now.","So first of all to answer your question, vis-\u00e0-vis generic XYTIGA, we really don't see a competition from a generic versus brand in this instance. I think the competition XYTIGA is really amongst generics XYTIGA versus branded XYTIGA whereas what we're seeing here is a clear uptick in Xtandi and specifically from the prosper trial in this M0 population, as you say, we are continuing to see it, as I've talked about in all the previous quarters, really, really significant and very confident uptake in urology prescribing.","And we do believe that this is underpinnings the growth of our non-metastatic population, and the fact that these are patients also earlier in their disease is helpful in driving our growth in this population. I'll also mention that just from a market share perspective, though the non-metastatic the M0 population has Xtandi or leader as well as new Becca [ph]. Xtandi by far in a way has the leading market share in this segment and has been from the time that it was launched.","Chuck Triano","Right. Thank you, Angela. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you, a couple of questions. One is on Prevnar in China. So sales have been ramping up there. But the regulatory authorities recently approved a domestically produced 13-valent product. And the CEO of that companies who just have capacity that's on the 10s of millions of doses and who knows if that's true or not.","But I'm wondering if you can give some perspective on how you see competitive dynamics in a situation like this going forward, not only in China, where our domestic producer could potentially benefit from favoritism, but also if that company were to take their product into other markets outside of China at a different price point.","I think a lot of investors assume vaccines are durable forever. But I'm wondering if this sort of thing could be disruptive and how you take the sort of potential competition into your forecast. Second question is on M&A. So any M&A that you may engage with in 2020?","Should we assume at least during this first six month window, while you still have Upjohn that is probably put on hold? And the last question on Vyndaqel, might there be a low hanging fruit phenomenon where we see an initial nice uptake, but then it kind of flattens out suddenly or do you expect this will be continued strong linear growth?","Albert Bourla","Thank you very much. I will give a quick answer to your M&A question Tim and then Angela can deal with revenue time and that growth. Well, I mean, I know the answer is no, absolutely not. We are very actively looking to invest capital on value creation opportunities. And I assume that we will have several of them in the first half of 2020 before the close of the deal.","Again, across the lines that I have described, exactly what we're doing, we want to make sure that we sustain the growth beyond 2027 when the [indiscernible] will have some impact. Angela, what about the Prevnar China?","Angela Hwang","Sure. So, we acknowledge that there is a new competitor in the form of [indiscernible] in the PCV13. However, I want to recognize that there are some differences here, though it is a 13-valent vaccine. Low vaccine, vaccine is made with a different conjugate and this conjugate technology being an older technology, so quite different from what we see in PCV13.","That being said, it is a competitor. However, if you sort of step back and look at the opportunity that we have in pneumococcal vaccinations there are approximately $14 million new births every year in China. And today, only over maybe 1% of those infants are being vaccinated. So regardless of the volumes that [indiscernible] might have available, I think the opportunity between us is just much larger than that.","And we have a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the marketplace. And we are confident that with the quality, the reliability, as well as the tremendous experience that Pfizer has had globally with PCV 13 but also the tremendous success that we've had in China specifically for PCV 13 that our growth will continue and this is what we expect.","We have a very robust footprint. You know - as you know, the vaccines and it will be the same for [indiscernible] PCV 13. This is an out of pocket market and it will be the same for the both of us. So this is where we'll be competing, which is why having a robust promotional engine and having a footprint of representatives that can really be available to support patients and caregivers at the points of vaccinations is really important.","And I think in this regard, we have demonstrated great expertise and ability to grow this market. So that's how we see it we acknowledge the competition, but we can continue to see tremendous potential.","Albert Bourla","What about Vyndaqel?","Angela Hwang","Alright. So in terms of Vyndaqel, yes, of course, in the year of launch, one might expect to see a little bit of a bolus, a number of patients who have been identified and are awaiting diagnosis and treatment. That being said, we are confident of what we've learned in the marketplace in our first year of launch. We are confident that, we have the right set of tools for helping physicians to suspect the patients that might have ATTR CM.","We have mobilized education around using noninvasive methods like scintigraphy to diagnose patients. And we've also mobilized a patient support hub to help patients receive their medications. So I think doing more of that, as well as continuing to think about new methods to help diagnose and treat patients such as using artificial intelligence and increased number of tools.","All of that will continue to support our ability to drive the important and rapid diagnosis of patients as well as their treatment.","Chuck Triano","Right. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly On your pending oncology vaccines rollouts in the US, given the challenges, it starts with vascular penetration. Could you talk to your expectations, particularly with these two drugs, there should be an economic incentive for payers given the posture. But yet there's issues in patients who already own an established inhibitor biosimilar to switch - an inhibitor brand to switch to biosimilar.","So if you could give some kind of senses, how much penetration and how quickly, you make specs that would be super helpful. And then second, in terms of tafamidis, Angela, you kindly gave some penetration figures at the beginning, which I was struggling to keep up with and write down but just more broadly, could you outline how large you think the untapped patient population really is here, and how far Pfizer is along in establishing that market? Many thanks.","Albert Bourla","Angela, lot of questions for you today. Please go ahead.","Angela Hwang","Okay. Sure. All right. So I think firstly we see the dynamics in oncology biosimilars being very different from that of what we saw in for inflammation in the form of Inflectra. So to your point about how will the dynamics change here and how quickly can payers as well as providers capture their savings, it's going to be much quicker.","This is the use of oncology biosimilars are much more rapid, like you see more patients cycling through treatment times are much shorter. So that's going to enable payers and providers to capture savings much more quickly, which is a very different dynamic that you see in Inflectra where it's a chronic treatment and patients are on their treatment for a very long time.","So I think that's one big difference. The second is that there is already a some - we already have some precedents. We saw this with eradicate where after a year of being in the market, though I know it's a supportive care in oncology, we already have 20% market share. This is still far cry from what we see in Europe where there is much more rapid uptake that I think that it's a signal indicator of the difference you see in the various biosimilar markets.","And we also have some early signals from competitor biosimilar that have already and some good market share in oncology biosimilars. So I think that we have some good indicator that this is going to be different. I think the benefit that we see here is that we have a portfolio of three oncology biosimilars all coming out around the similar time, like around now.","And I think what we have, we have a robust pricing strategy discount to the lack of the originator as well as I think strong relationships and networks built with both providers and payers that give us confidence that this will be an area of high growth for Pfizer.","Albert Bourla","Thank you, Angela.","Albert Bourla","And then your question was around tafamidis. Sorry can you just repeat that again?","Andrew Baum","The untapped population?","Angela Hwang","Got you. So as we've said in previous calls, we do believe that this is a rare disease and that in the U.S there will be about a 100,000 patients in total, globally, 500 but in the US a 100. To date we have diagnosed 9,000 patients so that lead us to 9% of the population that we have diagnosed.","So while this may feel like very significant progress on the time that we have launched and it is I think you can also see that we have a long, long way to go to finding all one and 100,000 of these patients. And what I spoke early about in terms of the education, in terms of how we suspect the disease, how you diagnose the disease and then very quickly gaining access of our patients and benefit from treatment of the disease these are all three levers that we are intensely focused on.","Chuck Triano","Great. Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hello. Thanks for taking my questions, couple if I may. Just on biosimilars following up with Angela, your comment about strong growth continuing on for the biosimilar. So wondering if you could give any color around how we should think about the trajectory over the next couple of years.","Is this a doubling or tripling of that now almost billion dollar business? And also would love to understand how you're thinking about the tale of each of the individual asset. Are you seeing - should we be thinking of this as a ramp that goes up for a few years and then eventually starts tailing off like others generics or do you see the stabilizing and having a sustainable tail?","And then just on Vyndaqel, you received positive CHP opinion in the EU in December. Given that Vyndaqel is already approved in the polyneuropathy indication wondering how we should be thinking about the price with the addition of the cardiomyopathy indication, is there any chance for moving that around? And then how we think about the ramp in the EU relative to the US? Thank you so much.","Angela Hwang","Sure. I will start with the last one first. So you're right we just received EU approval for Vyndaqel. And as you know there is a time lag between approval and then reimbursement in each of the countries. So all I can say is right now we are in active negotiations with the countries in terms of determining the price of Vyndaqel as well as its reimbursement.","You referred to the fact that we already have the 20 milligram approval polyneuropathy in Europe and we recognized that. That being said we have first of all, ATTR CM is a completely different indication, the trials that were conducted as well as the significant mortality benefits that would be demonstrated in our clinical trials, at ATTR CM are completely different.","And we have the clinical data to demonstrate the great patient benefit that we have in ATTRCM. And so that's the basis about discussions with each of the countries in Europe for reimbursement. Your second question was around Vyndaqel growth and sort of the pace of it. I think the way to think about it is the following. We have through analogues seen that only 30% to 50% of all rare diseases are ever diagnosed.","But of course, we believe that based on the mortality data that we have and the patient benefit that can be derived, that it is critical that we beat that or at least meet that. And so that's what we're intensely focused on. We have 10% of our patients with 9% in the U.S. diagnosed today, we have a long way to go. And that's what we need to do.","Your last question\u2026?","Navin Jacob","What's the rhythm on the biosimilars? You know, we've had strong growth 22% this year for the year, what can we expect going forward?","Angela Hwang","That's right. So I think in terms of the biosimilars again, this is an area of growth that we can anticipate. We have three biosimilars now in oncology plus the two that we had in supportive care. And so we look forward to this being a significant growth contributor to oncology portfolio not just from a growth percentage perspective but also from a revenue based perspective.","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah. I just wanted to add that Vyndaqel cardiomyopathy has a positive EU recommendation. So we expect the approval to come soon. And that links very nicely to the really helpful outline you did Angela.","Angela Hwang","Thanks Mikael.","Chuck Triano","And if we could take our last question, please, operator.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink","Mani Foroohar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. A couple little ones on the rare disease side; in terms of tafamidis we saw pretty attractive growth OUS. including some markets that don't necessarily have the cardiomyopathy indication yet. Is that some follow-on benefit in polyneuropathy from the increased promotional efforts in cardiomyopathy in Europe and elsewhere?","As a second question, given the expansion of patient opportunity in the polyneuropathy in the US, how do you think about the opportunity to pursue a supplemental NDA or similar strategy in the US, based on the real world evidence guidelines laid out previously by the FDA or would that require a separate study?","And then finally, on the gene therapy side, obviously pretty interesting data hemophilia at ASH moving forward in a couple Phase 3s now, how do you think about that market in a universe where you have multiple therapies within curative intent in gene therapy, alongside a number of fairly robust chronic therapies? Who are the patients who should receive an irreversible intervention in terms of gene therapy?","And who do you think deserve more appropriate for chronic therapy such as your own benefits? Thank you.","Albert Bourla","Yeah, I think I will ask Mikael to start with gene therapy and then I shall go with this great polyneuropathy that we have and how they fit together, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten","Yeah, thank you very much. What I think is unique in our hemophilia portfolio. First, of course, we have a legacy being one of the pioneers for intervenes deliver of Factor VIII and Factor IX so we have a platform and experience on the business in R&D side.","And as you so nicely alluded to, we also shared with our partners Sangamo some very much best-in-class data recently on the Factor VIII gene therapy. Our current portfolio has Factor VIII and Factor IX gene therapy plus our TFPI antibody that has like [indiscernible] an opportunity to provide a substitute alternative, but actually TFPI can be applicable for both Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiency.","So the way we see it develop is that, I think physicians will look at gene therapies that have durability and good tolerability. And that has really been the hallmark for the strategies when we developed Factor VIII and Factor IX best-in-class profile, because there are alternatives for these patients. So once they see the data for drugs, the treatments that are approved, that have durability, and really good outcomes, which I think has been so far what we have seen with our gene therapies those will be the one that can be adopted, because there are alternatives that have less convenience, but will, at least until strong data is available to be used.","You know, for patients that are early in their disease diagnosed at earlier age, I think this would be a very important treatment as it saves them from the bleedings, breakthrough bleedings that appear on lifelong treatment with infuse spin factor. And particularly for patients that are at early age that are physically active it is important to have a solution for sure.","So I think these would be tremendously important patient populations. But the availability of subcutaneous agents with supplement and also allow for patients that may have antibodies to the gene therapies to use them until sufficient number of gene therapies available that there is always one for each patient. And finally, let's bring it together.","I think what's unique with us is the entire portfolio that can address these patients and we look really much forward to the year around 2021 and '22 when we see this portfolio coming into registration phase. I think that was the main piece here.","Albert Bourla","Yeah. And then Angela may be on Vyndaqel have seen some uptick in markets, that cardiomyopathy was not approved. What's going on there? And about supplement and filing on polyneuropathy?","Angela Hwang","Yeah. In terms of polyneuropathy in the U.S., this is something that we're continuing to explore with the FDA. So, -","Albert Bourla","This isn't going be made yet. But we're in discussions.","Angela Hwang","That's right, exactly. And then, in terms of the upticks in polyneuropathy, I mean I'm not sure that it's a cardiomyopathy effect. As you know, we are improved. It's an approved indication for us, ex-U.S. So we continue to actively promote it. And it's probably as a result of those activities.","Albert Bourla","Yeah, we will have as we said approval for indication. And this is what I would think we will see material impact on Vyndaqel in cardiomyopathy in these patients we are not right now, we are just promoting of course the indications but we have registered over there, so we don't do anything outside that.","Albert Bourla","All right, I think this concludes more or less our call. Just I wanted to make some comments because really, I feel that an exciting point in Pfizer's history. And if you take a big picture view, over the last decade we have changed and refocused our approach to R&D, we have improved dramatically its productivity. And we have developed the best pipeline we ever had. And one of the best I believe in the industry.","If you've seen 2019, it was a year, but we took deliberate and thoughtful steps to strengthen each one of our businesses and eventually spread the current Pfizer into a new smaller, high growth profile enterprise that will remain powerhouse in marketing but also has been converted to the powerhouse of science.","Following the expected close of the Upjohn and Mylan transaction later this year, of course we will be a very different company. And we will focus on continuing to execute our strategy. This includes, we will continue the commercial momentum and preparing our new product launches. You have all asked a lot of questions about those products that are keeping surprising with our growth profile. And also, you've seen what we are taking seriously and we are investing in new launches.","We are continue advancing our internal pipeline, and will augment it with mid stages R&D programs through targeted bolt on business development opportunities. As I referenced before, we should continue seeing these type of activities in the first and second half of this year. Of course, we are working very intensively to set up Upjohn to be in a strong position when it combines with Mylan to become Viatris and create a formidable company.","And of course, we will continue leading the conversation in Washington. As we walk to address the affordability challenge facing patients. These are the areas that we are focusing for next year. Once again, we look forward to sharing more pipeline updates during our Investor Day on March 31. Have a great rest of your day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2015 performance. I'm joined today by as usual by: our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer [VOC]; Geno Germano, President of Global Innovative Pharma; John Young, President of Established Pharma [GEP]; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at our home page, Pfizer.com, by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance \u2013 Third Quarter 2015, which is located in the Investor Presentation section on the lower right-hand corner of this page.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report as well as on Forms 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, October 27, 2015.","We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly recap highlights from the quarter, provide a brief update on the pipeline, and close with a few thoughts on the issue of drug pricing.","To begin, I would note that we have had another quarter of strong operational performance, and we have grown revenues operationally every quarter this year. This top line growth resulted from several factors, including: the strong performance of in-line brands such as LYRICA in the U.S., ENBREL, and CHANTIX; the uptake from our new products that are early in their life cycle, including PREVNAR 13 adult, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS; and growth in emerging markets. We remain focused on continuing to generate this type of performance, where a greater proportion of our EPS growth is generated from top line revenue growth.","Just a brief word regarding PREVNAR 13, we continue to see a very attractive worldwide opportunity for the adult indication. In the U.S., we have done an excellent job finding and protecting 25% to 30% of the eligible population older than 65, and we did this more quickly than anticipated. As a reminder, on our last quarter's earnings call, we said we expect to continue to focus on the remaining population over 65 in the U.S., although this will require sustained effort as this group is more difficult to reach.","Also of note, during the quarter, we closed the Hospira acquisition. And I'm pleased to report that the integration is progressing smoothly, and we're beginning to see the expected value contribution to our GEP business. In terms of revenue, we are now the leading global player in the fast growing sterile injectable business, and we're the number two biosimilars company in the world. Through the acquisition, we now have three marketed products and more than seven years of in-market experience with one of these products. Our biosimilars pipeline is now one of the largest pipelines globally, with seven additional molecules in our portfolio under development.","We recently received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for Retacrit, a biosimilar epoetin. We are working closely with the FDA to address the concerns of the letter and, at this time, we do not believe any further clinical trials are needed. We are confident that the additional evidence we provide will support approval and remain committed to bringing this important medicine to patients in the U.S. as quickly as possible.","A few comments about the pipeline, I see our pipeline momentum continuing to build and remain particularly encouraged by our growing strength and presence in immuno-oncology. Regarding the anti-PD-L1, avelumab, partnered with Merck KGaA, the FDA recently granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. If successful, the first potential commercial launch of avelumab is anticipated in 2017, and our goal is to have at least one or more additional launches each year through 2022.","Beyond avelumab, we have a broad immuno-oncology portfolio across numerous mechanisms, including 4-1BB, OX40, a vaccine-based immuno-oncology regime, and CCR2. All of these assets are already in the clinic, 4-1BB, OX40, CCR2, and avelumab. And we expect to have up to 10 different I-O drugs in the clinic by 2016.","We continue to see combination therapy as having the greatest potential within immuno-oncology. And our broad portfolio of I-O, small molecule, and ADC oncology assets will afford us the opportunity to test a wide range of combination regimes on our own and with our partner, Merck KGaA.","We continue to grow our footprint in I-O through other collaborations such as CAR-T with Cellectis and in IDO with iTeos. And we entered into a collaboration with Kirin to combine our 4-1BB with their anti-CCR4 antibody and started a Phase 1 study in May. We believe this portfolio along with our skilled scientists should enable Pfizer to be a formidable player in this high opportunity area.","Turning to vaccines. In early July, we announced the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial of our investigational Staphylococcus aureus vaccine. We anticipate this study will complete in late 2017, with an interim analysis planned for late in 2016. Also in clinic (6:51) with the FDA, we restarted the Phase 2 trial for our Clostridium difficile vaccine, which has previously received Fast Track designation in August 2014. Enrollment in this program is now complete, and we expect to review data from it by the end of the year.","In chronic pain there remains a significant unmet need, with nearly one in five adults affected. To address that opportunity, Pfizer and Lilly have resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab. This program consists of six studies in approximately 7,000 patients across osteoarthritis, chronic lower back pain, and cancer pain. The study results projected to begin reporting out in 2017 and 2018. Of note, in the prior clinical studies of more than 11,000 patients, tanezumab demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy versus placebo and other commonly used pain medicines.","In inflammation and immunology, we are focusing our future investments in development programs on indications for XELJANZ in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis, while deprioritizing further development in Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. Additionally, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA on psoriasis. While we have yet to meet with the agency to discuss their concerns, we recognize that overcoming the issues raised may be difficult, especially in light of the evolving marketplace. We will reconsider our investment in the psoriasis indication for XELJANZ following this discussion with the FDA.","I would note that a new generation of potential therapies, including oral selected JAK inhibitors and IRAK4 are planned to enter Phase 2 studies in 2016 for inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatic diseases. We have a once-daily filing for XELJANZ under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date in February for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance of methotrexate. And if approved, we believe once-daily dosing will add to its competitive profile. In addition, we intend to resubmit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency by the first quarter of 2016 for the treatment of moderate to severe RA.","In assessing the current profile of our pipeline, I believe we have a competitive mix of compounds and modalities across the therapeutic areas I just spoke about in addition to cardiovascular diseases, rare diseases, and neuroscience where our expertise matches the potential we see. I'm pleased with our rate of progress.","Before turning the call over to Frank, I would like to offer a few thoughts regarding drug pricing. There has been a lot of attention on the issue of drug pricing. And given the upcoming U.S. elections, it will continue to be discussed and debated. Ultimately, I believe good public policy will prevail, ensuring the best outcome for patients while preserving a market-based system that enables the industry to continue developing new treatments and cures. However, that policy discussion must take into account the role of medicines and the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system.","Medicines are among the most effective and efficient use of private and public healthcare dollars. They represent around 10% of total healthcare costs and are expected to remain the same percentage over the next several years. This is because the price of medicines drop significantly once the patent expires. Today about nine out of 10 prescriptions in the U.S. offer generic drugs, which lead to significantly reduced costs in the healthcare system. For example, 12 million people take atorvastatin, and the cost has declined around 90% since 2005.","So given the high use of generics, many patients have access to medicines with low copays. What's difficult is when individuals cannot afford the increases in their copays when their treatment is on a specialty tier. No individual should have to bear the full cost of their treatment when they become sick. The increase in copay stems from healthcare policies that have a short-term focus with limited incentives to pay for treatments or cures.","Having an efficient and an affordable healthcare system requires incentives where insurance plans can be successful when they invest in long-term outcomes and provide for that success by ensuring wellness and prevention rather than treating the sickness. And to sustain the most vibrant, innovative biopharma community in the world, we must preserve the market-based system in the U.S. that enables us to continue to develop breakthrough treatments and cures for the benefit of patients.","In summary, we had another quarter of solid execution on all fronts, product launches, cost and expense management, and the continued successful integration of Hospira into our business. We are on track to have a solid finish to the year. We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders and continuing to research and develop new treatments to help patients live longer, healthier lives.","Now I will turn it over to Frank, who will take you through the numbers for the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.","As you know, on September 3, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Hospira. Consequently and in accordance with our U.S. and international reporting periods, our results for third quarter 2015 and nine months ended September 27, 2015 include approximately one month of legacy Hospira U.S. operations but do not include any financial results from legacy Hospira international operations.","Third quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $12.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $795 million or 6%, mainly driven by: the strong performance in developed markets of PREVNAR 13 adult, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS, all of which are early in their life cycles; LYRICA, primarily in the U.S.; one month of legacy Hospira operations in the U.S.; and 5% operational growth in emerging markets, mainly from Innovative Products. Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $1.1 billion or 9% and the loss of exclusivity of CELEBREX and ZYVOX in the U.S. and LYRICA in certain developed European markets.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 versus $0.57 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 160 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. Adjusted diluted EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.06 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies.","Reported diluted EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.42 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the non-recurrence of a one-time charge associated with the Healthcare Reform Fee versus the year-ago quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of increased purchase accounting adjustments, restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of Hospira, and higher asset impairment charges.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter reported revenues by approximately $1.1 billion or 9% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $601 million or 8%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter.","Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the third quarter Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year over year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including ELIQUIS globally and XELJANZ in the U.S. and the strong performance of VIAGRA and LYRICA in the U.S. and ENBREL in most international markets, which were partially offset by continued generic competition for RAPAMUNE in the U.S.","Income before taxes increased 14% operationally due to the operational increase in revenues and a 7% operational decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses, primarily due to additional investment and recently launched products and certain in-line products, and a 7% operational increase in R&D, reflecting increased investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab, tanezumab, partially offset by lower post-marketing trial expenses.","Third quarter VOC revenues increased 37% operationally due to the 50% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of PREVNAR 13, which grew 77% in the U.S. and 10% internationally; a 54% operational increase on oncology revenues, driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to lesser extent by SUTENT, XALKORI, and INLYTA in most markets; and a 7% operational increase in Consumer Healthcare revenues due to NEXIUM 24HR in the U.S.","Income before taxes increased 52% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 26% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to higher promotional expenses for PREVNAR 13 adult and IBRANCE, and an 18% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased costs associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for certain vaccine programs.","In the third quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 8% operationally, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December of 2014 and generic competition for ZYVOX in the U.S. beginning in first half of 2015 and LYRICA in certain developed markets in Europe beginning in the first quarter 2015, which were partially offset by the $330 million contribution from one month of legacy Hospira operations in the U.S. and 1% operational growth in emerging markets.","Income before taxes declined 11% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and a 3.2 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to unfavorable change in product mix, an 8% operational increase in R&D expenses reflecting the increased spending in biosimilars and legacy Hospira development programs, partially offset by lower post-marketing clinical trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by an 11% operational decrease in SI&A expenses, driven by lower expenses for products that have recently lost exclusivity and cost reduction productivity initiatives.","I want to remind everyone that on September 30 we updated our 2015 financial guidance ranges for reported revenues and reported and adjusted diluted EPS solely to reflect the anticipated impact of legacy Hospira operations on Pfizer's financial results from September 3, 2015 through fiscal year end 2015.","Today we are updating the ranges for certain components of our 2015 financial guidance to reflect the following factors: standalone Pfizer strong performance to date coupled with an improved operational business outlook for the remainder of the year; the anticipated impact of legacy Hospira operations from September 3, 2015 through fiscal year end 2015 on components other than reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS; and the minimal favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-July.","Consequently, we now expect reported revenues to be in the range of $47.5 billion to $48.5 billion, mainly driven by performance of PREVNAR 13 adult and IBRANCE in the U.S. as well as ELIQUIS globally. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $3.3 billion negative impact from product loss of exclusivity and losses of alliance revenue this year and a $3.1 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2014.","We also anticipate adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18.7% to 19.2%, adjusted SI&A to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $14.1 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Finally, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.43 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.16 to $2.20.","Now I'd like to walk you through the 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS. Specifically what I'm pointing out on the chart is impact of standalone Pfizer's operations on these three guidance ranges. With respect to reported revenues, we're raising the midpoint of the previous guidance range provided on September 30 by $1 billion, and we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.11. With respect to reported diluted EPS as a result of Pfizer's standalone operations, we've increased the midpoint of the range by $0.09. This increase includes a $0.02 negative impact from restructuring charges associated with the Hospira acquisition that are incremental to our previous guidance provided on September 30.","Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved another quarter of strong financial performance despite product LOEs. I want to point out that this is the fourth consecutive quarter that standalone Pfizer achieved operational revenue growth which are driven by products early in life cycles, including PREVNAR 13 results, IBRANCE, and ELIQUIS. We raised the midpoints of our 2015 reported revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges by $1 billion and $0.11 respectively to reflect both our year-to-date strong operational performance as well as our improved operational outlook for the remainder of the year.","We closed our Hospira acquisition on September 3, which was immediately accretive to adjusted diluted EPS upon closing and expect it to be accretive by $0.10 to $0.12 in first full year after the close, with additional accretion anticipated thereafter. And we continue to expect the transaction to deliver $800 million in cost savings by 2018.","We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date in 2015, we've returned $11.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we continue to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank and Ian, for the commentary. Operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I have two questions. The first is on IBRANCE. Ian, could you just talk about the first-mover advantage for IBRANCE and how you see that playing out in the marketplace? And also, if you could, comment on expectations for breast cancer survival data, and then any comments on the timing of readouts in other cancers.","And then separately with respect to your pursuit of M&A in Innovative Pharma, maybe both you, Ian and Frank, can comment on your current focus and how you want to set expectations for investors.","And also, Frank, if you could, just talk through the difference between the benefits of a 60:40 inversion versus an 80:20 inversion, and just characterize how the economics would differ in those two different scenarios. Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Albert, could you answer the IBRANCE questions please?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, certainly. Let me start with the competitive environment and the first-mover advantage. I believe, speaking about our program, we have the most advanced and a much broader program than any other competitor so far. And I say the most advanced because we are the first one and the only one that have registration right now in the U.S., a product that has been prescribed with over 4,000 physicians and has been received by more than 15,000 patients so far. And we have also filed in Europe, and our file has been validated by the European authorities.","Also, I say that we have a much broader program because we do have right now already two studies in first-line. We have two studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, and we have three studies clinical running in earlier phases of breast cancer. And in addition, beyond breast cancer, we have already 30 studies that are \u2013 excuse me \u2013 22 studies that are running in other indications of solid tumors. So we have a clear \u2013 not first-mover advantage, but we have a much broader program, as we see palbociclib as a major franchise going forward.","In terms of timing on readouts, that depends on the studies. The two studies we have already reading out, the PALOMA-2 study, which is a confirmatory study, will read out next year. We have the early breast cancer studies. That pilot will read around 2017 or will come in completion in 2017. And the other two, PENELOPE-B and PALLAS, will come around 2020.","And as regards to the survival data, we don't have any news on survival data, which is expected because the median survival in this type of population is approximately four years. So it will take some time until all these events will be accumulated.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Albert. On Innovative Pharma and BD, I think I'll limit my comments to something similar to the previous quarter, where we looked at BD as a way of accelerating value to shareholders. We feel that if all things are equal on returns, strengthening the Innovative part of the company will give a more balanced business between both Established and Innovative, especially in a potential split scenario if we were to split the company. And we continue to be active looking at BD and looking at sources of value, which are both pipeline which are operational synergies and potential financial synergies. And certainly I'll ask Frank to expand upon and talk about the 60:40 or 80:20 space and about how potentially wide the targets are for this type of innovation.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","And so, Dave, the way to think about this is less than 60% full inversion, less than 80% but call it greater than 60% kind of an in-betweener, a tweener inversion. The way we think about this is there's four buckets of cash in a hypothetical transaction like this. So there's our existing overseas cash and then there's our going-forward operating cash flow. And then there's the targets existing overseas cash and then their going-forward operating cash flow. The targets existing overseas cash and going-forward operating cash flow would be unencumbered. Our existing overseas cash and going-forward operating cash flow would be encumbered. And then the question becomes in a tweener situation how much of our encumbered existing overseas cash and how much of our encumbered going-forward operating cash can become unencumbered, and that's based on tax planning and those kinds of actions. And that is really, I'll call it, on a case-by-case, situation-by-situation, company-by-company basis. But we think of it in those four buckets.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Frank. So when you look at doing BD, you have to trade off what's the price, what's the value, what's the pipeline, and what's the risks you see in a case-by-case basis of sitting in the 80:20 space or the 60:40 space, so thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Operator, can we move to next question, please?","Operator","Yes, your next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you hear me all right?","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, loud and clear, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, great. Ian, just to follow up on that question on M&A, the last time we met, you had highlighted the attractiveness of a tax inversion deal. In fact, you signaled a preference for a tax inversion deal over an outright, say, U.S.-based acquisition. And now with Congress looking less and less likely to act on tax reform and your stock holding up exceedingly well in this volatile healthcare space, particularly given how much specialty pharma has pulled back, where are you in your quest to deploy capital? Can you give us a sense of timeline? It just seems to me like a phenomenal time to use your stock. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Jami. I'd have to check the transcripts. I'm not quite sure that I expressed a preference either way. I think I expressed a preference for an Innovative deal, and I think I expressed a preference for any deal that creates greater shareholder value, which would have to be a combination of, as I said, pipeline, operational synergies, and financial synergies. I do think there has been an adjustment in the price of some of the specialty companies. There has been an adjustment in their price. I'm not so sure there has been an adjustment in their expectations of what they want to sell the company. But I do agree with you that BD is \u2013 we do have the ability to do BD. It can be an important way of adding value. This management team is not afraid of taking bold steps, and we're looking at opportunities. And when we make our decision as to what is the best way of enhancing value, we will move.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Can we move on to the next question, please, operator?","Operator","Your next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning, Gregg.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I've heard the two CEOs use the word bold in the last couple of months, so we'll see how telling that is, but a quick three-parter. First is the PREVNAR franchise. How big could that become and how durable do you think that could be?","Secondly, Merck seems pretty excited about the SGLT2 program they licensed from you, especially in light of Lilly's outcomes benefits. So can you remind us what the economics are there and anything you said about the profile of that product?","And lastly on Retacrit, on that CRL, Ian, are there any signs that the FDA is grappling with policy or legal or precedent issues there, or is it simply just about the application and some data they want, non-clinical data? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","I'll ask Albert to talk about PREVNAR, and then Frank will give you an idea of the contractual relationship on SGLT2, which I think is an underappreciated asset and a huge opportunity for us and Merck in that marketplace. And then perhaps John could talk about what we're experiencing with the FDA on the biosimilars approval.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Gregg, thanks for the question. We are obviously very pleased with the results so far, and we continue to be excited with the opportunity. In the U.S., let me start. Two things stand out. The first is that we were able to make pneumonia vaccinations innate-based rather than a seasonal event that used to be until now. And the second, of course, is that we were very successful catching up adults previously vaccinated with the old technology product.","For 2016, we continue to believe that the catch-up opportunity will still be robust, although it may not grow versus 2015. To give you some greater context, there were 45 million eligible adults when the recommendation was issued. We estimate that we have penetrated approximately 25% to 30% of this population so far, and that were mostly previously vaccinated with the other product, with PNEUMOVAX. Why there are still many adults remaining, this cohort, as Ian said, is much harder to capture and will take more work to reach. But we do have programs to reach them and also have programs to reach the population below 65 that is immuno-compromised and that can benefit from PREVNAR 13.","Now in Europe, we received approval for pneumonia, and we continue to work with technical committees country by country to obtain recommendations and reimbursement. These will be phased over the next two-year period, depending on the country. But in general, I expect Europe to demonstrate strong growth.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. So in summary, we think it's a durable franchise, and we're very, very enthusiastic by continuing to invest in it and develop that marketplace. Frank, would you like to talk about the economics of the SGLT2 contract with Merck?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","Yes, so I think just a summary is think about it as a 60:40 split on profit. We get the 40% of the profit.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. And then on the biosimilars?","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Retacrit, thanks for your question, Gregg. Just as you heard in Ian's opening comments, we received a Complete Response Letter for the epoetin Hospira BLA from the FDA on October 16 of this year. I think importantly, our initial assessment indicates no additional clinical studies are required at this point.","So obviously, we come to your wider question comment on what the FDA or the position they're taking with other companies' biosimilars. We don't have any insight into that. What we can say is that we are currently reviewing our CRL, preparing our responses. We expect submission of our response sometime during the first half of 2016, with an expected six-month review under the BsUFA, Biosimilars User Fee Act.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Can we move on to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Good morning, Mark. Operator, we seem to be getting a lag on the questions coming in.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore","Is this better? This is Mark.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Yes, I can hear you now, Mark.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore","Okay, I'm sorry about that. First of all, congratulations on all the great share performance and fantastic shareholder communication over the last year. So a lot of my questions have been answered, but I thought I'd ask for a couple clarifications. Number one, Ian, I think \u2013 and again, please correct me if I'm wrong. I think you've said before that if you were to do \u2013 if you were to find a value enhancing deal that wasn't an inversion that you would like that deal to close before the end of 2016 because after the end of 2016, risks of policy changes, legal statutory changes increase. I'd just like to know if you still feel that way.","And then on the R&D side, I heard a remarkable number and I wanted to make sure I understood the number. The number was 16. What was that number? I heard it as you will have 16 immuno-oncology drugs in the clinic next year. Or is it something else? And if that's really true...","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","We'll have 10 novel drugs in the clinic next year, Mark, that are different, and we can ask Mikael to run through those in a moment. There are just too many for me to remember now.","And on the comment on taxes, given the proposed rule by the Treasury, which has not yet been implemented but has a retroactive date, clearly anything around this area, you need to be \u2013 one needs to be very careful on legislative changes. So if there was a deal to be done, I'd prefer it to be done under the present Congress, and then you're at a risk for the new Congress coming in and making changes in the rules. And of course, you don't know what the conformation of the new Congress will be, so you'd rather do it in a Congress what you do know who are setting the rules and what the rules are. So if we could go to the 10 products, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. So, Mark, we have said that we'll have up to 10 by next year, and they include already in the clinic avelumab, 4-1BB, OX40, CCR2. We're just now starting to enroll for our first triplet based on the vaccine, VBIR-1. We are moving swiftly with an additional PD-1. We have started to file an IND that we'll be dosing next year for our first bi-functional against P-keratinin (37:50), another small molecule immunomodulator IDO-1. We have an M-CSF antibody, which brings it to nine. And then we have a couple of programs that are running towards likely end of 2016 or early 2017, which include platforms such as additional bi-functional CAR-T additional vaccines and further checkpoint inhibitors. So I think you've got the sense it's very robust. It touches multiple modalities and gives us unprecedented opportunity for combinations.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Mikael.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","I guess on IBRANCE, I think I heard the metric that there are 50,000 patients on the drug. Can you just confirm that and tell us how that's changed over the past quarter?","Second maybe, Frank, you can talk about the gross margin and just some of the underlying dynamics and movements in the gross margin, so we can understand how to think about it going forward. What's sustainable and what's one-time?","And then third, maybe some of the pipeline Phase 2 assets that you haven't talked about before but something that we should be keeping an eye on as we move into 2016. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. I'll ask Albert to clarify the number of patients on IBRANCE.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, the number that I mentioned was 15,000, one-five, not 50,000. And compared to the previous number in Q2, we've had 9,000. So it's 15,000, up from 9,000 in Q2. And also to give you another statistic, it is 4,000 healthcare practitioners, up from 3,000 at the end of Q2.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","On the gross margins, so the way I'll answer it is just I'll do cost of goods sold, just the reciprocal. So last year Q3, 18.3%; this year Q3, 17.4%, so down 90 bps. What really drove that was operational improvement. There's a lot going on there, Marc. So think about foreign exchange in terms of cost of goods sold as a percentage is a good guy, it lowers the cost of goods sold. Our LOEs, particularly Celebrex, are a bad guy, so it hurts our cost of goods sold in terms of it will be increasing it. Those mitigate each other. And then for quarter, operational improvements really drove the number.","Our guidance for the year, 18.7% to 19.2%, so what's really going on there if you compare that to the year-to-date number, the 17.3% year-to-date cost of goods sold, is foreign exchange. If you adjust for foreign exchange, that 17.3% becomes almost 18.5%, which is close to the guidance range. And then when you add in Hospira, some of our projected sales for the remainder of the year, you get a little bit of a lift in the number, which gets you to the 18.7% to 19.2%.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. So I'd ask Mikael if he'd run through some of our near-term opportunities and then take that and extend it a bit to the third of our Phase 2 opportunities.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you very much. So nearer term, maybe a way to look upon it is we have really a few really exciting oncology platforms. You're well aware and we discussed IBRANCE in breast but also moving into head and neck and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The second platform, oncology, obviously avelumab with I-O combination, 4-1BB, OX40, and we'll actually soon share date on 4-1BB in various combinations, and also INLYTA that's used in I-O combination. In this case we have Merck KEYTRUDA.","We have two breakthrough drug designations that are moving towards registration planning, elotuzumab for ALL, and XALKORI for ROS-positive lung cancer, an indication where you have long duration of treatment. Now these were four oncology platforms. In non-oncology in near term are ertugliflozins that we briefly touched upon today, tanezumab in pain, bococizumab PCSK9 in cardiovascular, and XELJANZ in UC psoriatic arthritis.","Coming towards the earlier pipeline, we have \u2013 let's touch upon we have a real exciting rare disease pipeline starting to emerge with recently Phase 3 for rivipansel in sickle cell disease. We have another PD-9 inhibitor for prevention of sickle cell disease. And we have studies ongoing in Duchenne's and Huntington's with drugs that are touching these orphan diseases. And if these stay very strong, there are potential to consider path for accelerated approval. We heard from Ian mentioning that our C. difficile Phase 2 study is now completely enrolled. We're really looking forward to see that data come next year.","And then coming back to oncology, we have a new ADC PTK-7 that showed interesting data in Phase 1 going towards Phase 1b\/2. We have the (42:50) rights to XALKORI 392 (42:52) that have shown real robust (42:58) in this part of the pipeline. And we're starting next year multiple Phase 2 for our emerging immuno-kinase platform with IRAK-4, where we think we may be industry-leading, highly selective JAK-3, dual-acting JAK-1 to JAK-2, and also JAK-1 inhibitor. It will touch carefully selected indications where we think each profile has a unique purpose and fit to feel for the needs of patients. I hope that gave you a little bit of flavor of an exciting both near and midterm pipeline.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you for that.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Mikael; next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Anderson of Bernstein.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, a pipeline question, a non-market question, and then a strategy question. Earlier in the year when we talked to you, you mentioned you have an oral PCSK9 in development. And if I remember right, you said we might see data in 2016, human data. I'm wondering if that's still the plan.","Second question goes back to PREVNAR in adults. When we've I think looked in the past at benchmarks, healthy penetration into the adult population might be something like 60%. I'm wondering if you can say what you think realistic penetration of PREVNAR in adults is likely to be in U.S. and Europe.","And then last question is on potentially splitting up. Investors are obviously assuming that you'll do this at some point in 2017 or maybe later. But looking at it from the other end, what would be the counter-arguments to splitting up? In other words, why might it make sense that Pfizer would not want to go down the route of splitting up? What are some of the biggest hurdles to overcome?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","On the split, as we've said before, we haven't made a decision. We said we'll make a decision. The latest we'll make it is in the fourth quarter of 2016. And the four criteria we've set up is are the businesses doing well inside Pfizer? Are they likely to be successful outside of Pfizer? Is there trapped value, and do we believe we can realize that trapped value?","From the other end of not doing a split, if we were to do a major acquisition in the intervening time period, then it would certainly change the timelines of a split. It wouldn't necessarily change the logic of it to the extent that that logic proves out. It would certainly \u2013 it may even strengthen the logic for it. But that would be a decision that would be taken post any type of acquisition and post understanding the timelines that involves.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","And the answer to all four of the questions that Ian summarized needs to be yes. In terms of if we were to go down a split path, the answer to all four questions needs to be yes.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So on the pipeline question, Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So thank you for remembering our exciting small molecule program against the PCSK9 target. And obviously, we are increasingly excited about that space as we have seen some of the struggle around the CETP drugs. And we are on track for dosing patients end of this year, and we have collected our IND documents, so it's perfectly on track. And I should say it's a novel mechanism that we have identified in our discovery work to intervene with the PCSK9 function, and we're very excited to get it into humans and see its impact.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. And, Albert, on the PREVNAR 13 adult penetration question?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, it's a very interesting question. Let me say that it seems that previous benchmarks or analogs of adult penetration have become somehow irrelevant after the very successful introduction of PREVNAR adult. And this was \u2013 I will give you just some data to support my statement. But right now we have achieved a market share of 87%. That's extremely high, as you can understand. In pharmacies right now we are having a market share of 90%. And keep in mind that pharmacies also, their overall share of participating in vaccinating and catching up patients has increased dramatically. I would say that we have disrupted this channel with our introductions.","Also, our consumer activation and information campaigns have become very successful, and our commercials have run very, very high. As a result, the awareness among healthcare practitioners, for example in the U.S., has exceeded 90% according to market research that we have run, which of course is exceptionally high.","So I cannot predict what eventually will be the overall penetration of adults in this country. But I would say that we are very optimistic with the success of this first year as to how much we can achieve for the benefit of the patients in the U.S.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the question, so just a couple quick ones. Historically you guys have provided some numbers around your thoughts on the size of the biosimilars market. Where do you see that? Can you just update us on your thoughts on the size of the overall biosimilars market and where and when you really see the acceleration in that market occurring?","And then the second question, can you just give us a sense again of the level of penetration that we're at with 15,000 patients? What does the IBRANCE label currently approach? And then ultimately with the adjuvant setting in breast cancer, can you remind us again how much of the market that would open up? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Size of the biosimilars opportunity, John, would you like to comment on that, please?","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Yes, sure, so thanks for the question, Seamus. Obviously, as you know, the biosimilars market is still in the process of forming in different regions of the world. We're very excited to be playing a leading role in the formation of that market with the portfolio that we now have, both of our own legacy Pfizer pipeline of biosimilars but also the in-market portfolio of products from Hospira.","Overall, the market opportunity that we see is around about $100 billion worth of revenues from currently patented branded biologics that will lose patent protection over the next five years. The global market for biosimilars, looking at many analysts, is expected to grow from around about $1 billion today to somewhere on the order of $17 billion to $20 billion by 2020. Clearly, there are a number of factors that will drive and influence the evolution of that marketplace such as substitutions, such as the labels that \u2013 extrapolation of labels that products that come to market will have. Overall, I would just say that we believe that we're really well placed to draw on the heritage as a really strong biologics company in R&D and in manufacturing, which we believe will leave us to be very well placed in that market as it forms around the world.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. So, Albert, perhaps you can take us through a little bit the layers of opportunities we see in number of patients, or potential patients, probably talking about the U.S. for IBRANCE.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, and I will also speak a little bit more generally. Let me start by saying how excited we are, of course, with this opportunity. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. There's 1.7 million diagnosed every year with breast cancer. And approximately 60% of them, which means approximately 1 million, are ER-positive HER2-negative, an area that IBRANCE has demonstrated efficacy so far.","Now with IBRANCE, we are working to build a broad franchise, and this is how you succeed around breast cancer and beyond. Speaking about breast cancer, we are starting with the first-line, and then we move to recurrent and then to early breast cancer. In the U.S., we expect to expand, first of all, as the opportunity goes, our market share in the first-line. Right now we have a market share of approximately 27%. And moving to next quarter, next year, we expect to expand that even further. We also expect to have an accepted filing by FDA of our PALOMA-3 data this year. We expect it will give us registration for later lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.","In Europe, we have filed and our filing was validated. The filing in Europe was based on both PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-3 data, which means that covers the entire metastatic population, not only the first-line, as was our submission and current label in the U.S. We are also working to expand our label to earlier phases of breast cancer, as I have indicated earlier, with currently three major Phase 3 studies running. That includes basically thousands of patients. The PENELOPE-B is a study that includes more than 1,000 patients. With the PALLAS, it is a study that will include almost 5,000 patients, 4,600 patients. And the pilot (52:36) study, which is the first one that was introduced in that setting, is expected to come into primary completion around 2017.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Albert.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the questions. I just had two here. The first, if we think about business development, potentially addressing three broad areas of your business. It seems like you're talking about improving top line growth, driving operating synergies, and\/or improving your tax rate or financial synergies. I know these are all important. But how would you rank order those three in terms of importance? Are some of those must-haves and some of those nice-to-haves? I'm trying to understand as you're looking at the landscape of what you can go after, how you're weighting those three broad categories.","My second question was on inversion, which has been talked about a lot. But just in the current political environment where there's a lot of negative headlines around pharma already out there, how do you think about political risk of inversion just in this election season and with a lot of noise around the drug industry already out there? Thanks so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So I think, Chris, the best way to think about this is that we want to target the maximum return on investment. And this is a mix-and-match combination of, as you said, financial, pipeline, growth, financial synergies, cost synergies. And the puzzle is to find the target company whose price and those three combinations allows us the highest rate of return on the disposition of precious capital.","So I won't \u2013 and then on the negative issues of pharma, I'm a little \u2013 I'd like to hear a few words about that. I think there has been some negative press on particular pharmaceutical companies. I don't see that society is saying they don't want innovation and society is not looking for cures for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer. And so I think our industry continues to remain firmly in good stead in the sense that we remain a low percentage of the healthcare cost. We are, I believe, the most efficient way of dealing with costs in the healthcare system. And so I think public policy is squarely behind having an innovative industry. Certainly I think we can make the case that this industry risk-adjusted is appropriately profitable. Its P\/E and its return on capital and return on investments are I think appropriate inside the averages of the stock market. So I think the returns of pharmaceutical companies are reasonable in that context. So I do believe that we have a lot of positive arguments to make when having this dialogue with society.","So around the political ramifications, the shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize their return, and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust successful company in the future. Their jobs and their careers depend upon it. So part of the leadership of this is to ensure this company can be successful in the future. To be successful in the future, we need to have a competitive tax rate. So that is why it's an important issue for us. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...questions. I think a lot's been covered, but a couple more on the SGLT2. How should we think about your positioning here given you'll be fourth to market and you won't have any CV data until the 2019 \u2013 2020 timeframe? The feedback we've been getting is it's largely a JARDIANCE-specific benefit until proven otherwise. And so to what extent do you rely on a competitor showing CV outcomes data to confer class effect given you'll potentially be the last to have a CV readout?","And then just second question, last quarter you stated that you see biotech valuations as priced to perfection in many ways. Clearly there has been a significant adjustment since then. In light of this, it would be great to get your current thoughts on valuations. And how is this changing how you're thinking about your strategy with regards to M&A and the potential geography of targets? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Colin, on the biotech, I think there has been a readjustment in pricing. As I said, I think it's been a readjustment in the stock price. I'm not sure yet there's been a readjustment in what investors and the leaders of these companies believe their company may be worth in a transactional situation. So I think we'd have to wait a little while to see if the new stock valuations settle in, in the reality of management's belief in the value of the companies. And then the second question was on...","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","SGLT2.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","SGLT2. So I think Geno can take us through some of the logic on that.","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. Colin, we're very pleased about the SGLT program and the recent findings from the BI-Lilly program on cardiovascular outcomes. We have a cardiovascular outcome trial underway. In fact, it's fully enrolled already with our SGLT partnership with Merck & Co. In light of the new findings from BI and Lilly, we are considering additional work that we may do to further augment the package that we're pursuing with our program. We have, in addition to the single entity development program, a fixed-dose combination with JANUVIA and with metformin. And of course, with the market position of JANUVIA in the diabetes market, we think that we'll be very competitive with our data package, and we look forward to entering that market.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","I'd like to say I'm extremely pleased that Pfizer is doing a partnership with Merck & Co., two great companies with great heritage in this space, and we look forward to being very successful with this combination product.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian and Geno; next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen.","Steve M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, I have three. The JAVELIN trial of avelumab in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer has a primary completion of 2021. So I imagine there are interim looks between now and then. Maybe you could tell us when those interim looks are or when the first one is perhaps.","Secondly on the CDK-4\/6 inhibitor landscape, I think the general view is that the Novartis agent is not differentiated, but the Lilly drug does look quite unique and potentially a threat to palbociclib. I think the recent Breakthrough designation was notable. I would like your view.","And then lastly, thoughts on the recent baricitinib versus HUMIRA study and its potential impact on XELJANZ. Why isn't this a risk to XELJANZ? Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Okay. Perhaps we'll ask Mikael to talk a little bit about the CDK-4\/6 competitive space and what we know and don't know.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you. So I think I will start and a little bit punctuate what Albert said that palbociclib IBRANCE is the only CDK-4\/6 inhibitor studied in multiple randomized control studies and has such a profound program for advanced recurrent early breast and multiple indications also beyond breast. It's a highly selective drug for CDK-4 and CDK-6. We do think hitting both CDK-4 and CDK-6 is preferable. And it's very tolerable, which is important for a drug that is playing in patients from first-line up to early breast cancer.","What we have seen from the edema type of (01:00:58) drug is data from an analog (1:01:00) in very advanced patients to multiple chemo, almost a salvage line. And that's obviously positive for patients being at that very difficult advanced stage. We know that it's a drug that is much broader than the CDK-4 and CDK-6 that characterizes, as you're right, fully said palbociclib and rebociclib.","So for me it's a different drug class, broader, less specific, and may play very well in this more advanced setting where the data has been currently. And obviously, there have been some tolerability issues reported which may reflect this broader profile. It's very difficult to comment on competitor drugs. So like always, we say let's have data over the next few years and experience from patients guide us. But I thought that maybe gave you an opportunity for us to summarize the status today.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","I think one of the competitive positions we're taking is to accelerate a very broad in-depth clinical trial program behind IBRANCE to ensure that physicians have a broad experience with multiple indications and get in early and establish the standard of care there. So I think that's our answer to if there is a competitive threat, that's how we are dealing with it. Would you, Geno, talk about XELJANZ?","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. So, Steve, the baricitinib data that was recently released showed superiority on ACR20 and the DAS28 endpoints. In our own program, as you know, we had a trial including HUMIRA where we showed strong numerical separation not only on ACR20 but on ACR50 and ACR70, more difficult endpoints to demonstrate a difference. Now that trial was not designed as a superiority trial. It's more of a comparative trial. But that led us to initiate a head-to-head superiority study with XELJANZ in RA compared to HUMIRA, where we're testing both monotherapy and XELJANZ with methotrexate against HUMIRA with methotrexate. So it's a robust study. We'll be reading out in the first quarter of 2017. We think that that will help shed more light on the performance of this drug in this setting, this clinical setting.","The endpoint for our head-to-head is ACR50. As you know, Ian mentioned before we have the once-a-day dossier filed with the FDA now, with a PDUFA date of February 2016. And then we have our post-marketing safety study that also has arms with ENBREL and HUMIRA in. So we'll have really good comparative data over the short and medium term to put these drugs into perspective. Frankly, I think that the JAK pathway is a powerful pathway that offers the potential for strong efficacy, and we think that that will play out with both baricitinib and XELJANZ in the long run.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Geno. We like our position of having the opportunity to look at it with and without methotrexate as well, which if any of you have ever had to take methotrexate, they'll understand why people don't like to take it. Albert, would you like to discuss the JAVELIN question?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, I do not have handy the date of when the interim analysis will happen in this study. And anyway, as you know, these are event-driven, so you never know what eventually will happen. What also I can tell you, this is as you know, a second-line lung cancer study. We are planning to initiate a first-line study this year hopefully. That will have an expected readout much earlier, so around 2017.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. I just had a couple, one building on what you were just talking about with the JAK inhibitors and XELJANZ. Can you just give a little more detail on the decision you made to focus your priorities? You said you're stopping development in Crohn's, ankylosing spondylitis, focusing on other indications. Was that something specific to the product? Was it safety or efficacy of the product in those indications, or was it more of a view of the commercial competitive dynamics in those other indications?","And then second, just one if I could on ELIQUIS. I just wondered if you can give a little more color on what you've been seeing there. We haven't really touched on that on this call yet. And I'm wondering if you expect any negative impact given the approval of PRAXBIND, the reversal agent for PRADAXA, recently. I'm just wondering. Do you think that might impact physician-prescribed here over the next year or so prior to having an antidote for ELIQUIS in the Factor Xa available? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Geno, first two questions, please.","Geno J. Germano - Pfizer Inc.","Sure, so let me start with XELJANZ. As we continue to see the studies read out, obviously we become more informed about how this agent is working in these various patient populations and various disease states. Our decisions on prioritization are made on the basis of the data that we're seeing, the emerging profile of the drug, again, across different patient populations, and also the timing of and the amount of work that's required to continue these programs. So it's a number of factors that has led to the decisions that we've made. We are very excited about continuing in the RA and the psoriatic arthritis and the ulcerative colitis areas. We're very encouraged with what we've seen so far. And these are very large, robust market opportunities. So we're looking forward to a bright future for XELJANZ.","With regard to ELIQUIS, frankly, we're continuing to see ELIQUIS take share in the NOAC market around the world. We're a leading product now in a number of countries. We're a leader with cardiologists in many more countries. We established our foothold in the stroke prevention market and now in the thrombo-embolism market. We're continuing to make inroads in primary care. So that engine just keeps rolling.","With regard to the antidote, the feedback that we've gotten from the physicians in the marketplace is that it's a nice-to-have and they welcome it. We don't expect it to have a major disruptive effect on the marketplace.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Geno.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Geno, next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Baum of CRTI (sic) [Citi].","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","It's Andrew Baum from Citi actually, three questions, short ones. First, Mikael, do you have a SERD anywhere near the clinic?","Second, with regard to biosimilars, I'm interested in Pfizer's view on interchangeability. Is it economically desirable within the U.S. landscape given the much likely rapid erosion of revenue as a consequence?","And then finally for Ian in relation to inversion, I note that Medtronic after inverting inside Covidien seemingly have had to import $10 billion worth of offshore cash with only a $500 million tax bill. Given this did not fall at the 60% level, does this mean that there's still a surprising amount you can do despite being higher than that threshold?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Let's answer the questions in the order they were taken.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So I assume you're considering what else in our pipeline could combine with IBRANCE. And we do have, as you know, the PALOMA-3 with a SERD, fulvestrant. We have some internal activities on porel SERD (1:09:04), but nothing that allow me to give you a date when it could or could not get to the clinic.","I wanted though to say that we have exploration in the clinic with a PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor that we have ourselves that have a unique tolerability profile because it's given intermittently. So we do explore with internal and potential partner drugs how you could combine. But I would probably be more keen to go beyond the estrogen receptor blockade and look for a mechanist that could be more much additive, synergistic when we develop the CDK-4\/6 franchise further.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. John, could you discuss the interchangeability issue?","John Young - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. So first of all, let's just say that we view biosimilars as playing a key role in the future of healthcare, and they can address the evolving needs of patients, physicians, and payers.","On the interchangeability question specifically, I think our view as a company is that interchangeability should be based on science and under physician supervision. Since biosimilars are not the same as the reference products, the traditional paradigms that you might see in a small molecule of interchangeability and automatic substitution just don't apply. So we believe that regulators and also payers should and will look at the data specific to each individual biologic molecule. That's why we have comprehensive development programs for our biosimilars so that we can actually help physicians and patients to be able to make informed decisions about how to appropriately use those molecules.","And so our key point here is that there really is a need for more scientific progress to make interchangeability feasible and for that to really be driven by the data for individual molecules.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","Thank you. Frank, on the various flavors of inversion?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer, Inc.","I think the best way I'll answer this, Andrew, is your question I think is actually a good example of what I said before, which is it's really target-to-target specific in terms of how much of the benefit you can preserve of an inversion if you're an in-betweener in terms of less than 80%, then greater than 60%. And the example you gave is I think a good example of where benefit is being preserved. But it just punctuates my point before about it's really target-by-target, company-by-company specific.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","And I'd like to point out that these rules are proposed rules. They have not been triggered.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Operator, if we could, take our last question, please.","Operator","Yes, your final question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. Ian, just building up on your earlier comments on trapped value and the split decision, is it fair to say that the ongoing strong performance of your Innovative business strengthens the split argument since there does appear to be significant trapped value there? So in terms of a go\/no-go decision, I guess is it fair to say that the split argument is strengthened from your perspective?","And then on immuno-oncology, given your focus on combinations, how are you thinking about pricing in the current environment given how the first-generation products are priced? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer, Inc.","So I think on the split, to the extent that both businesses are doing well and can command premium P\/E ratios, if those P\/E ratios aren't being seen in the combined stock, then it would be an argument to say that this tracked value could be released via split. So I think we'll look at that and look at how the market is pricing the Pfizer Inc. stock compared to what the individual stock should trade at if their P\/Es were unfettered, so to speak, by being on their own.","And then I do think you're right that I believe that one of the competitive advantages will be if a company owns the sequence of treatments and the combination products. So I really see in oncology, it's becoming a chronic disease where you move from one combination to the next, to the next, to the next. And so the ability to both price those combinations individually and price if you have enough in your portfolio while also price a longer period of different treatments is going be extremely important as a competitive ability.","Charles E.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2017 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.","The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our web site, pfizer.com\/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward l1ooking statement.","Official information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, including in part one, item 1A. And that is filed with the SEC and available at sec.gov and at our web site at pfizer.com","Forward looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of those statements.","Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K, dated today, October 31, 2017. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8-K on our web site at pfizer.com\/investors.","Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.","We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks today, I will briefly talk about the progress and opportunities within each of our businesses, our recent announcement regarding our Consumer Healthcare business, and some of the promising assets in our pipeline, which we believe have the potential to become a foundation for our future growth prospects.","Starting with the quarter. We again reported solid operational revenue growth. If you exclude the impact of the Hospira Infusion Systems divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues for the quarter increased 4% operationally compared to the prior year quarter. We also raised the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the year.","I'll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer's Innovative Health. This business had another strong quarter, growing its top line 11% operationally. This increase was driven by continued growth of key brands, including Ibrance and Eliquis globally and Xtandi, Lyrica, Xeljanz and Chantix in the U.S.","Ibrance had another strong quarter with revenues up 59% on an operational basis compared with the same quarter last year. We remain confident in its continued growth potential and leadership, despite there now being two other approved CDK 4\/6 inhibitors.","Ibrance share is now nearly 50% for first time, new patient starts in advanced breast cancer. And prescription volume continues to grow. As of the end of September, Ibrance has been prescribed by more than 11,000 physicians to 70,000 patients in the U.S. and more than 18,000 patients in the EU, and received regulatory approval in more than 70 countries, including Japan.","With Xtandi, we continue to see growth in prescription volume. Although Xtandi's revenue growth is not yet tracking in line with prescription growth, due to patient assistance free drug program utilization as a proportion of total demand, we are pleased to report that we have now recorded sequential revenue growth for two consecutive quarters.","I would also note that the patient assistance program proportion of total demand was comparable with that seen in the first and second quarters. And we continue to expect that the program's utilization will normalize as we move into next year. Of note, the number of urologists actively prescribing Xtandi again reached an all-time high this quarter, and these increases remain one of the key factors supporting Xtandi's continued growth.","In June we announced the readout of the Xtandi's Phase 3 PROSPER trial in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has been accelerated by two years. We are pleased the trial met its primary endpoint of improved metastatic-free survival. And we have said previously we see these positive results as key value drivers that support our acquisition thesis for Medivation. And we are working with our partner, Astellas, on worldwide submission plans based on the PROSPER data to seek expansion of the label to non-metastatic CRPC.","We continue to hit all-time highs in terms of new rheumatology prescriptions for Xeljanz. We received a record 9.8% of weekly new prescription share for the month of September for our current indication of rheumatoid arthritis. And with the weekly high reaching 10% so far in October, Xeljanz continues to be the fastest-growing advanced RA therapy.","We see the potential for two additional and meaningful growth opportunities for Xeljanz with our two pending regulatory submissions for other conditions. For psoriatic arthritis, Xeljanz received an overwhelmingly positive vote in favor of approval at the FDA advisory committee meeting in August. We anticipate a final decision by the FDA before the end of the year. Xeljanz has also been accepted for review by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, with a PDUFA date in March. We've completed filings for both pending indications in multiple other countries.","For Eucrisa, we've seen steady progress. Approximately 83,000 patients started treatment with Eucrisa by the end of the third quarter. More than 23,000 prescribers have provided Eucrisa to patients across the dermatological, pediatric, and primary care communities. And more than 60% of those prescribers are repeat prescribers. Prescription volume and share velocity continue to strengthen through the third quarter, supported by the successful launch of our DTC campaign.","Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health, while revenues for the quarter declined, we once again saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and in our biosimilars portfolio. We also continue to see the value of biosimilars in expanding patient access for important high-quality, low-cost treatment options.","Our biosimilars business continues to grow, with global revenue increasing 67% operationally in the quarter.","In September we presented two positive Phase 3 readouts for our first oncology biosimilar, trastuzumab, which is a proposed biosimilar to Herceptin. The readouts were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress. Both the FDA and EMEA have accepted our filings for this potential therapy.","As of the end of September, Inflectra in the U.S. has grown, albeit slowly, to a 4.9% share of the overall U.S. infliximab market by volume. We continue to have 100% Medicare coverage as well as strong coverage in Medicaid. And in situations where the insurer and provider are the same, such as the VA, we have seen rapid uptake of Inflectra, with share in these situations reaching 54%, up from 20% in quarter two.","That said, Inflectra penetration in the U.S. continues to be slower than expected due to the exclusionary contracting of Remicade by J&J, contracting that we believe violates the antitrust laws. As you know, we recently filed suit in the U.S. District Court against J&J. We did this to help ensure the true value of biosimilars can be unlocked for the benefit of patients, providers, and our nation's healthcare system. We are actively working on a range of strategies to help Inflectra accessibly to more patients and also to lay the groundwork for a smoother, more rapid uptake of all future biosimilars in the U.S. marketplace.","Additionally, just yesterday, along with our partner, Celltrion, we presented new data showing that switching patients with Crohn's disease to Inflectra from Remicade leads to a comparable efficacy, safety, and tolerability to treatment with Remicade. That's adding to the totality of evidence supporting switch to Inflectra.","Within our Essential Health portfolio, we have been experiencing supply shortages with some products. The shortages are primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues.","When we acquired Hospira, we originally thought it would take one to two years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. We have a robust action plan in place, and we believe we will make substantial progress in 2018 towards reducing the sterile injectable shortages.","As we look ahead, in addition to continuing to expect revenue growth from our patent protected portfolio, we are very encouraged by the convergence of two positive trends, the decline in the number and revenue impact of LOEs facing our business and the further strengthening of our R&D pipeline and its potential to drive incremental revenue.","We expect the full-year year-over-year impact of LOEs to continue to be significantly lower than our recent past. We're forecasting the impact to be approximately $2 billion in each of the next three years, about $1 billion in 2021, and then $500 million or less from 2022 through 2025. At the same time, we expect a steady flow of new products to begin to emerge from our pipeline. Here are a few of our most recent advances.","The development plan for ertugliflozin for Type 2 diabetes remains on track, and we expect the decision from the FDA in December.","In oncology, our PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, top line results from the Phase 3 EMBRACA trial will read out by the end of the year. The EMBRACA trial is exploring talazoparib versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer.","In partnership with Merck KGaA, we expect data on Bavencio, our PD-L1 inhibitor, in combination with our 4-1BB agent later this year. The study is looking at patients who have not been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These data could be ready for potential presentation during 2018. We also anticipate data from our triplet combination with Bavencio, our 4-1BB agent, and our OX40 monoclonal antibody in late 2018. This study is recruiting on track.","Also, by the end of the year, we plan to submit an application with the FDA for lorlatinib, our next-generation ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. On October 16, we presented full results of the lorlatinib Phase 2 data that will form the basis of our discussions with the agency.","In Inflammation & Immunology, we recently presented positive Phase 2 data for our once-daily oral JAK-1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis, and we are planning to move this compound into Phase 3 studies shortly.","In Vaccines, we started Phase 2 trials for our next-gen 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine and have received fast track designation for it from the FDA.","These pipeline advances represent just a few of the assets that we expect to form the foundation for offsetting our remaining LOEs. We believe the combination of our strengthening pipeline and the anticipated continuing easing of LOE impact has the potential to support a nice inflection for our future revenue growth rates.","I'll close my remarks with a few comments regarding our Consumer Health business. Earlier this month, we announced that we were reviewing strategic options for this business. This could include everything from a full or partial separation of the business to ultimately deciding to retain the business.","We are taking this action as part of our regular ongoing reviews of our portfolio, pipeline, and business strategy. Although there was a strong connection between our Consumer Healthcare business and elements of our core biopharmaceutical portfolio, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there's a potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company. We anticipate there will be broad interest from potential acquirers. And we expect to make a decision in 2018.","In summary, we continue to execute on our strategy. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we have several key brands that we believe are positioned for continued growth. The unfavorable impact of LOEs remains lower than in previous years, and we expect it to drop off even further in the coming years.","And our innovative core is as strong and vibrant as it's ever been, which is positioning us well in the areas of greatest patient need and where science is evolving.","Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results for the quarter.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.","Now moving onto the financials. Third quarter 2017 revenues were approximately $13.2 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $178 million. Third quarter 2017 revenues were also slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $54 million. If you exclude both the revenues of Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, in both periods as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter 2017 revenues increased $458 million or 4%.","Our Innovative Health business recorded 11% operational revenue growth in the third quarter 2017, driven by Ibrance and Eliquis globally, the addition of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition in September of 2016, and Lyrica and Xeljanz both primarily in the U.S. All of which were partially offset by lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued biosimilar competition and Viagra in the U.S. because of wholesale or de-stocking prior to anticipated generic competition beginning in December of 2017.","Revenues for our Essential Health business decreased 11% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of this year. The remainder of the decline was due to a 22% operational decline from peri-LOE products, including Pristiq in the U.S., which lost marketing exclusivity in March of 2017, and Lyrica and Vfend in developed Europe markets. As well as a 12% operational decline in the sterile injectables portfolio, primarily due to legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. All of which were partially offset by operational growth of 67% from biosimilars.","In emerging markets however, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 7% operationally, primarily due to 6% growth from the legacy established products portfolio and 14% growth from the sterile injectables portfolio.","Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.47 compared with $0.22 in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a re-measurement loss on HIS in the year-ago quarter, higher gross margins, and lower restructuring and implementation cost, all of which were partially offset by higher purchase accounting adjustments.","Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.67 versus $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted other income as well as fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by product losses of exclusivity, product supply, and a higher effective income tax rate.","I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 109 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February and completed in May of 2017.","As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $54 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $16 million.","As a result, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter.","As you can see on the chart, we narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2017 financial guidance. We narrowed our revenue guidance range. And we now expect 2017 revenues to be in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion. This range continues to absorb an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity, $1.2 billion due to the divestiture of HIS, and an anticipated $100 million negative impact due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates versus 2016 rates.","In addition, supply challenges primarily related to legacy Hospira products have had a negative impact on projected 2017 revenues of several hundred million dollars. Consequently, we lowered the midpoint of our 2017 revenue guidance range. That said, we expect these challenges to moderate in full year 2018.","I want to point out that if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the sale of HIS, the midpoint of our updated revenue guidance would represent a 2% increase from fiscal year 2016 revenue levels.","With respect to adjusted diluted EPS, we increased the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03. And we now expect 2017 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.62. The midpoint of our updated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is $2.60, versus our 2016 actual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, implies a growth rate of approximately 8% year over year.","It's important to note that this guidance range includes the anticipated negative impacts of approximately $0.03 due to the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, $0.01 for foreign exchange compared to 2016, and $0.01 resulting from our May 2017 agreement with Sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for hemophilia A.","Excluding these, the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS would have been $2.65, which represents a 10% increase versus 2016 actual results, which is significant given the $2.3 billion of top line headwinds we are facing due to the product losses of exclusivity that I just mentioned.","I want to take a moment to comment on the impact of the hurricanes that took place toward the end of the third quarter. First and foremost, we have nearly 2,000 Pfizer colleagues who live and work in Puerto Rico. And their safety and well-being is our first priority.","I'm pleased to say that we have confirmed the safety of all colleagues in Puerto Rico. And we are now providing direct assistance to them.","Pfizer also has three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico. While these sites sustained some damage, we have made significant progress in repairing our facilities in anticipation of ramping up to full operations over the coming months.","As a result of dual source supply options and sufficient pre-hurricane inventory levels, our assessment at this point is that any revenue impact is expected to be insignificant. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make any updates to our outlook if warranted.","Moving on to key takeaways. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding HIS revenues and the impact of foreign exchange from both periods, revenues increased 4% operationally year over year, driven by the strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Chantix, and the contribution of newly acquired products, including Xtandi.","We narrowed certain 2017 financial guidance ranges, including raising the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.03 to $2.60 from $2.57. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.8 billion to shareholders year-to-date 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, which includes a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank and Ian. Operator, can we please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Perhaps first, Ian, one for you. If there were to be no tax reform, is your bias at that point to look for an ex-U.S. company or not?","And I want to tie my second question back to the first one as well, which is when we get these updates on avelumab plus 4-1BB and OX40 combinations from your ongoing MEDLEY trial, how does that inform whether or not you'll look externally for a large IO acquisition? Thank you so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks for the question. So on the tax reform issue, if there's no tax reform, we will continue to look at acquisitions based on the value creation for shareholders as we've always done. So I don't really speculate on that.","And on the IO development, obviously the IO is an interesting category. It has a lot of variability right now and in performance of different products. We remain focused on improving our business in IO. And we'll have to wait to see with the readout of those trials as to what it tell us and what direction we want to take.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe the first was just elaborating a little bit on Ibrance trends in the U.S. You talked about 50% penetration right now. So the question is, where do you see penetration peaking over time? And what do you think it's going to take to get that additional penetration in the market?","My second question was on repatriation and tax reform. I think you've talked in the past of about $160 billion of foreign earnings at Pfizer. And that repatriation of these earnings could allow the company to bring back significant future earnings to the U.S. at a very low tax rate. To the extent we get repatriation, should we think of that as just fundamentally altering your approach to either leverage or capital deployment? I guess another way of looking at this, should we think about a step-up in Pfizer's annual capital deployment if this were to occur, whether that's large deals, small deals, or repo? Or is this just \u2013 be kind of business as usual as it relates to business development? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, do you want to deal with Ibrance?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you. First of all, let me say that we are very pleased with the results of Ibrance. We've had 59% growth globally versus the same quarter of last year. Ibrance last year was already a $2 billion product, so this is a significant growth.","Moving forward, the growth for Ibrance will come in the U.S. from expanded usage with already prescribing physicians, but also from expanding the CDK market as you well alluded. The penetration of CDK right now, it is 50%. But if you see the new patients, it is 57% and historical was always 50%.","I think the introduction of new CDK competitors in the market and, more importantly, the publication of more data is enhancing the confidence of physicians in the class and will benefit overall the class. So I see that \u2013 I don't see any reason why this will not go very high, because it is the standard of care anyway","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Frank?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Do you want to discuss the repatriation alternatives?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. So, Chris, all the numbers you cited, the $160 billion is a number I've cited previously. Remember that's accumulated profit and earnings, that's not cash. You basically said that in your question.","You really had two questions. One was, does it alter our approach in capital allocation? From my perspective the answer is no. Our priorities for capital allocation don't change. They are dividends, share buybacks, investing in the business, and M&A. Those will continue to be our capital allocation priorities going forward.","And then your second question was, would that alter our approach on business development? My answer is no. From my perspective our approach doesn't change. It's we're agnostic to size. And hopefully our actions over the past or in the past have demonstrated that. And our compass on deals has been, is, and will remain shareholder value.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Frank and Albert. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly, on talazoparib, given the recent Merck\/Astra [AstraZeneca] deal and the anticipated heavy investments in the program, could you give us an outline of where you intend to go and how quickly with your DNA damage repair agent, both on monotherapy in selective patient populations as well as in combination with Bavencio and your broader portfolio?","And then second, while I know shareholder value will guide your direction, should I assume Pfizer has no interest in asset swaps with enthusiastic potential buyers for your Consumer business, such as GSK? In the event of a trade sale, most likely use will be cash to fund business development?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Sorry. Mikael, would you like to take the tala question?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, thank you for your interest in talazoparib. We regard it as a very potent PARP inhibitor. It's dosed as 1 milligram. And it has tumor activity that has been very efficacious in preclinical models and in early clinical studies.","We look very much forward to the near readout of our Phase 3 EMBRACA trial that's exploring talazoparib versus standard of care in germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer.","We also are looking at avelumab plus talazoparib across a number of tumor indications, which may allow us to take benefit of the increased impact of talazoparib to make tumors immunogenic, in which avelumab can augment and benefit for patients. We are starting those studies and look forward to expanding them rapidly.","We see also opportunity for talazoparib in other combination, such as Xtandi in prostate cancer. So indeed, it's a growing important asset for us.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Mikael. On the question of the Consumer business. We have some time been looking and seeking strategic deals for our Consumer business, whereby we would \u2013 perhaps involving asset swaps. I think this process we're going to take in the strategic review may shake loose more alternatives in that aspect.","And in regarding the proceeds, it's really premature to speculate, given the fact it may not be \u2013 we may spin the division as a separate company, depending on how we create maximum value. So we'll have to wait to see exactly how we recover the full value of this business.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian and Mikael, next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Sticking on the theme of big deals, since you're asked about your willingness and interest in doing big deals so often, I was hoping you would offer your historical view on whether very large deals in the industry and for Pfizer in particular have been value enhancing.","Secondly, John, can you go into some more detail about what's causing the shortages? Is this a system-wide issue? Is it tied to FDA issues or just demand outstripping supply? And when do you expect the close out letter from McPherson? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Frank, retrospective on big deals, please.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, so I guess the big deal would be Wyeth in terms of what we've done. I think the retrospective on that is it's been very value enhancing. If you look at our portfolio today, much of it has come from the Wyeth acquisition. When we announced that deal, we announced $4 billion in synergies. We clearly exceeded that.","If you look at the value we got for the Nutrition business that came from Wyeth, if you look at the value we got in Zoetis, much of which came from the Wyeth acquisition, if you look at the Consumer business that we currently have. So quite frankly, if you look at the Wyeth business retrospectively, significant value creation from that acquisition.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","I think in general, I would say that the big deals prior to that have also been value creation deals. So, as we always said, we're agnostic to size as we have a core competency in business development and integrating companies. And we'll continue to use that competence. John, do you want to comment on the shortages?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, so thanks for the question, Gregg. So in the Essential Health portfolio, as Frank mentioned in his comments, we have been experiencing some supply shortages for some of our products. The shortages are primarily for products in the legacy Hospira portfolio. And they're driven by I guess a blend of what we term capacity constraints and technical issues.","I think as Frank also mentioned, when we acquired Hospira, we originally thought that it would take one to two years to integrate their manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues that we were aware of. What I would say is we have a robust action plan in place, and we believe that we'll make substantial progress in 2018 towards reducing the sterile injectable shortages.","In regard to McPherson, I think all I would say is that we've submitted a corrective and preventative action plan to the FDA, and we've been diligently working to address the items outlined in the warning letter. We provide regular updates to the FDA on the status of that action plan and will continue to do so.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. On biosimilars and the J&J suit, maybe if you could, just address them. How pervasive do you think these types of anti-competitive contracts are? What do you think the timeline on resolution and potential outcomes could be? And do you think this largely explains the major difference in the uptake in Europe and other outside the U.S. markets on biosimilars versus the U.S., or do you think there's another dynamic going on? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Doug, would you like to answer that?","Douglas M. Lankler - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. So taking the last part of the question first, we do think so. We think in what we're calling the closed market area, we're seeing uptake that we think supports our claim that J&J's anti-competitive practices concerning Remicade have denied U.S. patients and the broader healthcare system the benefits of robust price competition and therapeutic options in the biologics marketplace.","Our concern that J&J has threatened to withhold significant rebates to insurers for both current and future patients and also engage in what we think are inappropriate and inaccurate marketing claims, for example, suggesting that patients need to fail first on Remicade before using Inflectra \u2013 seem to be unique to J&J. But obviously, we believe it's a violation of the antitrust laws.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","John, do you want to add something?","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, I would just add, David, that as Ian mentioned in his comments, Inflectra has actually performed well in closed systems in the United States, and those are systems which prioritize healthcare cost savings over short-term rebating. And as of quarter three, we've reached a 54% share in those closed systems.","And I think our perspective is that the performance in those closed systems demonstrates that where payers, providers, and patients have access to Inflectra, Inflectra can offer significant value. The closed systems obviously only represent a relatively small portion of the market, around about 5% of total infliximab volume. And I think as Doug has commented, due to J&J's exclusionary contracting, lower priced Inflectra has largely not received commercial access at parity to Remicade and remains disadvantaged. But overall, I think that our performance in the closed systems really represents the value that Inflectra can deliver to healthcare providers and to patients.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John and Doug. Could we move to our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just have a couple. First for you, Ian, has Pfizer had discussions with other companies regarding alternative drug distribution models or potential new entrants into the drug distribution business? Obviously, I'm referring to the havoc that is wreaked upon that industry because of the threat from Amazon. I just would love your thoughts on that. And just taking a five-year view, do you see new entrants entering the drug distribution industry, PBMs or drug retail pharmacy industry? Just wondering what your thoughts are on that.","And then just if I could move to the Essential Health business, that business continues to be a real drag on your overall performance. And there you cited specific reasons this quarter. At the time of the Hospira deal, I think you had projected that this business would eventually flatten out because of growth in emerging markets, opportunities from the sterile injectable business, as well as biosimilars. But that doesn't seem to be panning out. Is this business salvageable? Can it ever stop declining and in fact start growing, or is this just an anchor you're going to have to deal with? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Jami. On the potential changes in distribution, all I would say is that any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in vis-\u00e0-vis a distribution system going back into PBMs and adjudication. I think that's somewhat more of a difficult strategic proposal, as it then enters the whole issue of the world of insurers and PBMs and deciding on differential access, and that's a whole different skill set.","Regarding the Essential Health business, I'll ask John to make his comments on that.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","So look, thanks for your question, Jami. And let me just reiterate what we've said in the past, which is we've always said that in the medium term, we believe that we can return the Essential Health business to low to mid-single-digit growth. We didn't specifically put a timeline on that. But we framed that out as being over a three to four-year period.","The reason that we believed that it was going to take time is because of the headwind of LOEs. Frank commented on that in his comments. And whilst for the corporation, the impact is moderating, in 2017 we still have some headwinds, predominantly in the Essential Health business.","So in quarter three, just to quantify that, the total LOE impact on the business in the quarter was around about $339 million, due to just a range of products that have gone off patent or are experiencing generic competition, Pristiq, Lyrica, Vfend, Relpax, Nitrostat, and so on.","The thing about those time-bound events, however, is that by definition they will moderate. And so that basic aspiration to return this business to be a low to mid-single-digit grower is something that we still retain.","And just to break out the performance in the quarter for you, Jami, although Pfizer Essential Health declined by 11%, if you actually exclude the impact of the Infusion Systems business divestiture and also the impact of LOEs, the business was actually flat in the quarter.","So I think whilst we are still on that path to recovery, I think we remain committed to and actually very positive about the aspiration to return this business to the growth profile that we've outlined in previous quarters.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks for the question. So first question, Ian and Frank, can you guys comment on the structure that you think would really optimize the value for the Consumer business? You guys have sold businesses in the past, but also I think the Zoetis split was a great example of success. And you've also done some creative combinations. So just trying to get a better sense of where you think the most value has really been added for shareholders in the context of those different decision points with Consumer?","And then the second question really is when we think about the opportunity in the IO space, would you guys please comment on clinical trials that could read out next year that you're most excited to see the results of? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay, I'll ask Frank to answer \u2013 give you our thoughts on the structure that would most likely optimize value. And then I'll ask Albert to talk about IO studies \u2013 sorry, I'll ask Mikael...","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","...about how IO studies reading out.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So, Seamus, on structure. Let me just start with obviously we have a baseline view in terms of what we think that Consumer business is worth, based on obviously our projections on future cash flows, discounted back to a net present value.","In terms of structure I think it's really, what maximizes value? And if you look at what we've done in the past in terms of some of our larger divestments, we sold the Capsugel business. We sold the Nutrition business. And then we split, to your point, the Zoetis business.","Obviously when we were doing the Zoetis transaction, we were receiving incoming calls, had offers. But quite frankly, we didn't think that those offers exceeded the value that we could get from a split. And so we went ahead and we proceeded with a split.","So my answer, my short answer is we will pursue the structure that best maximizes the value to our shareholders. And hopefully our actions in the past have demonstrated that that's what we've done.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","So thank you for the interest in our IO portfolio. So we actually have, together with our partner Merck KGaA, a very much, well running IO portfolio. And we have 30 studies, including nine in new pivotal indications and more than 6,300 patients enrolled.","In the near-term readout from now towards 2019, we have actually eight pivotal readout, starting quite soon with gastric third line, followed by in 2018 lung second line, ovarian second line as we come towards end 2018 and into 2019, real interesting studies in earlier lines such as kidney cancer, combo of Bavencio and Inlyta, Bavencio in gastric first-line maintenance, in lung first-line, bladder first-line, and ovarian first-line, chemo, IO, all in 2019.","In addition to those eight pivotal studies that can be registration-enabling for us, we have a number of non-pivotal that can guide us to accelerate clinical programs. And that includes late this year and early next year, IO combos with 4-1BB followed by Bavencio with OX40. We'll share further data on Bavencio with lorlatinib and with also late next year, our triple combo will be part of this.","So I would also like to say that we have, beyond just the checkpoint inhibitor, a very interesting vaccine opportunity, where we have our prostate vaccines that will be followed by another vaccines go into human studies in the quite near future, that contains multiple vaccine components, plus PD-1 blockade, plus CTLA-4 blockade, really interesting concept.","And finally, beyond the IO, you probably are aware that we have a very rich and vibrant and quality portfolio where we recently announced in our targeted portfolio, positive data for Xtandi in PROSPER. We have in preparation for registration plans around dacomitinib, lorlatinib. We have soon readout of talazoparib. And we have positive data on glasdegib, which make us engaged in also registration study.","So it's a very rich and quality pipeline, where obviously the IO and Bavencio is an important piece. Thank you.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mikael. Can we move for our next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So first, I just want to see if you can give a little more color on the impact of price in the U.S. on the quarter for the Innovative Health business as a whole? Or at least for some of the key products, like Ibrance, Lyrica, Eliquis, Xeljanz.","And then my second question also on \u2013 touching on Eliquis. Just curious there what your thoughts are. Have we seen positive data from Xarelto from the COMPASS study? They have some additional data coming from their lifecycle management program over the next few years. So do you see that data in any way impacting Eliquis' growth?","And just curious, just looking back now, there's a very limited lifecycle management program around Eliquis. And I think it's just sort of surprising for such a large product. Is there anything that you and Bristol [Bristol-Myers Squibb] are doing in terms of trying to come up with new indications or somehow extend out that product beyond what it is right now? Thanks so much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Frank, impact of price? And then Albert can discuss Eliquis.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So globally, all-in, total company price for the quarter was 0%. In the U.S. it was plus 3%. That's for the quarter. If we go year-to-date, so the nine months cumulatively, same numbers. All-in enterprise-wide, total company globally, 0%. In the U.S. plus 3%.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Eliquis, Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes. First of all, let me say that Eliquis had a phenomenal performance again this quarter, 43% operational growth for the quarter. The U.S., significant growth of 39% operational growth. It is the number one NOAC prescribed by specialists and primary care physicians.","To your question on data already presented, based on the consideration that I'm going to say, we see the potential impact of COMPASS study upon Eliquis business will be limited.","First of all, in the broader protocol of exclusion of NVAF patients, the rivaroxaban-only arm did not meet efficacy endpoints. There were high bleeding rates for both rivaroxaban arms in the trial and at different dose and dosing regimen compared under rivaroxaban NVAF dose. That being said, I want to emphasize that we cannot make a comparison when we don't the complete studies. But we feel very confident on the growth projections that we have right now with Eliquis.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you please update us on the recent IPR developments on your pneumococcal vaccine patents through 2026? And the potential implications for Merck's 15-valent vaccine or other potential pneumococcal vaccine competitors?","And then second, could you just frame for us where Ibrance's ex-U.S. rollouts stand and whether you ultimately expect ex-U.S. Ibrance sales to eclipse the dollar revenue opportunity in the U.S.? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Doug, please, the IPR, inter-partes review, process.","Douglas M. Lankler - Pfizer Inc.","Sure. Thanks for the question, David. So we were very pleased to see the October 20 denial of Merck's inter-partes review filings on two of our U.S. patents covering compositions of pneumococcal vaccines. So these patents stand as valid and will not expire until 2026. We believe these patents and others in our portfolio may present freedom to operate issues for Merck or anybody else trying to develop a pneumococcal vaccine. As Ian mentioned at the outset of the call, we've started Phase 2 trials for our next-generation 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine and have received Fast Track designation from the FDA.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Doug. Albert, on Ibrance?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, ex-U.S. Ibrance is performing very well, and we are very pleased. Let me focus on Europe right note. It is the best-performing area, because we have also the upcoming launch of Japan, but it's not started yet. The early EU launch indicators, they show rapid Ibrance adoption in first-line. There is also strong adoption of Ibrance in patients who were already treated with AR monotherapy, also in patients in later lines of therapy.","We are having positive discussions with reimbursement bodies right now. Pricing and reimbursement process are ongoing across Europe in accordance with national procedures and timelines. But we have already secure investment in several countries. We are in the middle of multiple negotiations, so I wouldn't like to speak more about that.","Our international sales were in this quarter $165 million. This is up 30% versus the previous quarter, sequential of the second quarter. In Europe in particular the growth was even greater, 35% up versus the previous quarter. We see this trend continue as we are launching in other jurisdictions and as we are getting price reimbursement in Europe and as we are going of course to places like Japan.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. On the lawsuit with J&J on Inflectra, if you don't win, do you think that would have broad negative ramifications to other future U.S. biosimilar launches? And it would foretell a different future uptake profile in the U.S.? My guess is that you'll answer that yes, otherwise you wouldn't be suing, unless you're suing for some other reason.","And second question is going back to a question I've asked frequently in the past. Your commitment to avelumab? The reason for my question is pretty obvious. In the past you've said you're committed. But some investors I talk to claim that over the last couple of months, management has said they would be willing to upgrade \u2013 you'd be willing to upgrade your anti-PD under the right circumstances. I'm wondering if you'd like to either confirm or deny that? Or maybe at minimum just add some current color to the question?","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On the lawsuit, Tim, I think the lawsuit was taken because we strongly believe that the actions of J&J are not acceptable under the anti-trust litigation. More importantly I think the solution to this will come from a societal view on that biosimilars are there to provide access to patients once the patent has expired. And that enough is enough. That you shouldn't be using contracting mechanisms to extend your exclusivity, when society expects to get access to products once the patent is expired.","So we believe there will be quite rigorous debates within society, within the CMS, as how does the governmental systems accrue the benefits of biosimilars. So we sort of see it as both a legal strategy and a strategy of alerting policymakers that Europe is obviously benefiting from biosimilars, so why isn't the U.S.? Given that the law was passed to make biosimilars readily available.","On avelumab, we remain committed to our programs with our partner. Regarding any rumors you may or may not heard, I really can't speculate on them. I've actually I think addressed a couple of questions from you on calls about our partnership with Merck. And I don't really think it would be helpful to add any more comments.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. First question for Frank. I know you haven't outlined 2018 guidance, but could you maybe walk us through qualitatively what some of the headwinds and tailwinds are that you're expecting for 2018 that might impact or shape our models?","Second question on the Established (sic) [Essential] Health business. On some of the smaller companies we've seen multisource competition being accelerated by ANDA approvals on injectables. Are you seeing an increased number of ANDAs being approved across injectables? And is that having an impact on pricing?","Third question on Ibrance. In Europe in particular in markets where you have to negotiate pricing, do you \u2013 are you recording any deferred revenues or for revenue recognition purposes that might show up in 4Q or in 2018? And that should do it for the questions. Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Okay. Thank you, John. On Ibrance the answer is no. We continue to sell Ibrance under our traditional model of selling and booking sales when we make them. On the Essential business, perhaps John could make some comments.","John D. Young - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, so, John, look, I think the FDA have been very clear about the perspective that they have that they believe that competition is the most important factor in being able to reduce health care costs. That's actually a position that Pfizer has long supported, that we believe in a competitive marketplace and we also believe that the availability of timely approval of generic alternatives is critical to patient access and long-term sustainability of the health care system.","We manufacture and commercialize a number of products in the FDA's published off-patent pharmaceutical product with limited or no competition today. And we do anticipate that certain products on that list that we currently commercialize could face competition from additional manufacturers over the next several years.","All of that said, we also are currently exploring opportunities to bring to market certain other products on the list, which Pfizer could have the manufacturing capability and capacity to reliably produce. So the FDA have been very clear about their perspective in this space. It's a competitive market space. And one that we expect to remain so.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And I would add that the requirements from the FDA and the European Union on the manufacturing of sterile injectables continue to increase and ensures that any competitor needs to have robust good manufacturing practices, which is also positive for patients. Frank, on the models?","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","So, John, we'll give detailed guidance for 2018 on our next earnings call, as we always do when we close out the fiscal year. We'll close out 2017, and then we'll provide guidance on 2018. But in terms of you mentioned headwinds and tailwinds. The way I'll do this I think is maybe the rhythm of the revenue. So we'll have LOEs next year. Our current estimate on LOEs is about $2 billion, so that will be a headwind.","In terms of tailwinds, we continue to expect new products like Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz to perform very nicely. Our recently acquired products, like Xtandi and Eucrisa, we expect to perform very nicely in emerging markets. If you look at emerging markets for the quarter, up 11%, year to date up 9%, so we continue to expect those areas of the business to perform well. Biosimilars this quarter up 67% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So lots of areas where we expect to see continued growth going forward. And we'll give details on guidance on the next call.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Frank. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks. I have two quick questions. Firstly on Xeljanz, how much interest are you getting from rheumatologists and gastroenterologists on the prospects of its approval in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis?","And then also I noticed your JAK-1, you presented data in atopic dermatitis. Can you just give us some color on how it compares to other JAK inhibitors in that space? Thanks very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Richard. Of course, on Xeljanz, we don't do any pre-marketing activities on indications that haven't been approved. But in discussions with experts who advise us, we think it is a competitive profile in both of those conditions. And on JAK-1, I'll ask Mikael to add some commentary.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for your interest in JAK-1. We shared data recently at the EADV conference in Europe. And obviously, there has been another JAK-1 that together define the JAK-1 class performance in atopic dermatitis.","On the efficacy side, we shared that it was a very impressive number of patients that reached cleared or almost cleared skin lesions, about 45%, in that range. What is very interesting with this class is that it has a rapid onset of action. Within a few weeks, you see improvement. And between weeks four and six, you have reached a very significant part of maximal effect.","Atopic dermatitis patients suffer particularly from pruritus itch, and I think this is really unique in the yaquant clause (59:02) and was evident in our study that already two days \u2013 I repeat, two days of the initiation of therapy, you could see itch relief. And then within two weeks, it has reached really impactful effect and plateaued at 64% that got very substantial itch relief.","And to the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been any reported drug or recently approved drug that has had such favorable rapid onset, which is critical for these patients. Thank you for interest.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a few questions. I think the sale of Pfizer Consumer to J&J a decade ago was viewed as at a great price, but in retrospect a strategic mistake for Pfizer. Would you agree with that characterization, and why is it different now?","Second, regarding Xtandi and the PROSPER trial, the release says Pfizer will discuss the results with health authorities. Given the positive study, what is there to discuss as opposed to just filing outright?","And then lastly, I appreciate that it is completely in line with background rate, but there are about 40 DVTs or PEs reported in Xeljanz studies. Has Pfizer looked at whether these patients were also on Celebrex or other COX-2 inhibitors? And if you have, then what did it show? Thank you very much.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Steve, thank you. I'm not sure that your general characterization of the J&J deal is accurate. But nevertheless, that's something that's in the past. We make decisions on future dispositions based on the facts we see today and the opportunities we see today. And we believe that it's well worth exploring the strategic alternatives for that business. Vis-\u00e0-vis PROSPER...","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","PROSPER, I can take.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah, will you please?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Steve, I want to be clear. We were delighted with the PROSPER positive top line reports that came two years earlier than anticipated. We are looking forward to disclosing detailed results at an upcoming major medical congress.","Given the nature of the data and the importance of the claim, we have resourced very well. The team is preparing the dossier, and we expect to file soon.","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Concerning Xeljanz, first of all, as you know, it's been performing excellent. It has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients worldwide. And we had recently an advisory committee for expansion into psoriatic arthritis and got an overwhelming positive vote for the efficacy and safety profile.","Concerning specifically thromboembolic events, we have of course carefully looked at Xeljanz, both in clinical studies comparing Xeljanz to control group, as well as in registers and how it's performed in the market. And we do not see any difference between Xeljanz-treated or other treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients.","We're aware that there have been some competitive reports of some other compounds in this space. But we do not see any issues with Xeljanz at all in all our different analyses, where the clinical registers on the use of the drug in the market.

Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. I have three, if I may. First, following up on Xeljanz ex-U.S., could you please comment on how we should think about the uptake there relative to the strong growth that we're seeing in the U.S?","Second, on Eucrisa, I think it's fair to say that the launch is slower than expected. Is the outlook for that product still peak sales of $2 billion, even with the JAK-1s emerging as competition?","And then third, on Hospira sterile injectables, I think, Frank, you said supply challenges led to sales being several hundred million lower. If that reflects demand, is it fair to say that most of that should come back in 2018 as you address those shortages? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Albert, could you address the Xeljanz ex-U.S. and the Eucrisa performance?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, let me start ex-U.S. with Europe. We are very pleased with the performance in Europe. Xeljanz can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerant methotrexate or when treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.","So far, we have launched in nine markets, and those includes UK, Netherlands, Sweden, but we do not have still pricing negotiations completed with the rest. We think that the uptake in Xeljanz based on our initial interactions with physicians will be very strong in Europe.","Now let me go back to Eucrisa. First of all, let me start. Yes, we think that will be a $2 billion-plus product, and we are very excited with the progress. In the third quarter we almost doubled the number of patients versus the previous quarter, the second quarter. As Ian said, we have 83,000. And the product has been prescribed so far by more than 20,000 physicians. And the majority of them, 60% of them, are repeaters. We have 90% of commercial lives that have removed the NDC block, which is very, very good. And they're covering now Eucrisa. However, at this moment, only approximately 50% of the commercial lives have unrestricted access or require one electronic step edit, some require more. And they're working very hard to revisit that.","Also I need to emphasize that the net sales, the so-significant sampling and couponing, which was introduced to launch and to drive success. The free trial voucher now has expired. However, we have a standard co-pay card that continues to be supporting patients' affordability.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","And I think the JAK-1 marketplace is different from the topical Eucrisa marketplace. And they're appropriately medically segmented, giving opportunities to both \u2013 for both products.","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Very different and a very different profile with Eucrisa have a very benign profile in terms of safety and could be given to kids as young as two years old.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Albert. Frank, please.","Frank A. D'Amelio - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So, Alex, John mentioned that the Hospira remediation efforts in the legacy Hospira manufacturing facilities are taking a little bit longer to remediate than we thought. However, we believe those will be substantially completed by the end of 2018.","As a result, we expect that several hundred million in 2017 to moderate into 2018, which means we'll be lower in 2018 than 2017.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you. Thanks, Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, Mikael, I was hoping you could give us some highlights on some of the key products in the pipeline that have moved into clinical studies, maybe into Phase 2 and stuff. I saw there was a NASH drug that moved in there. Maybe you can talk about that a little bit. And then also provide us an update on tanezumab. When are we going to see the first pivotal study? Thanks.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Good questions, Marc. Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yes, thank you. Starting with tanezumab. We're very excited about that product. And of course given the national crisis with opioids, it's \u2013 the really main opportunity near term for novel pain relief mechanism that has no addictive abuse related profile.","So you should expect during somewhere between first to second half transition next year, that we will start to communicate the studies, osteoarthritis followed by chronic lower back pain. It's overall, six Phase 3 studies in approximately 7,000 patients, a very comprehensive package. And we are very encouraged and optimistic that this could be a real very important option for patients going forward. And that's why we look forward to see the data in this study.","In the portfolio that you asked me about, I will just mention that with the recent positive readout of our JAK-1 atopic dermatitis that I earlier commented on, is a really intriguing example of how this next-generation JAK can contribute very meaningful clinical efficacy.","Within that JAK portfolio, we have a lot of momentum. And we expect next year to have readouts of two different JAKs in alopecia. And I remain very encouraged that these two novel JAKs could represent new treatment options for a patient group in alopecia that haven't really had any new treatment in decades.","We also have a readout for our 2Q (1:09:15) JAK-1 in psoriasis Phase 2. And you may have remembered from an earlier small trial readout that that drug performed in a very impressive excellent manner. So these are example in the JAK portfolio.","We recently also shared positive data from our gene therapy Factor IX study. And we're now advancing that together with Spark Therapeutics towards planning for pivotal studies. We have data ongoing with Sangamo on our Factor VIII gene therapy.","And finally, on the ACC NASH study, we are very encouraged about the ACC drug that we have. We think there is opportunity due to its liver selective profile to give it that really optimal level to get a very meaningful lowering of lipids in the liver. And we are just, right now, on the cusp of starting those studies. And hope to have readout late next year or early the following. So stay close to us.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","You're quite welcome.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners.","Olivia Brayer - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Olivia Brayer on for Tony. I have a two-part question regarding the JAVELIN Lung 100 study for Bavencio. What was the reasoning behind the dosing amendments to the trial? And can you provide some sort of color on how you were thinking about those amendments and on PD-L cutoffs that you were using?","And then my follow-up question is, do you see crossover as a potential problems for your overall survival data? And for which hazard ratio did you power the study? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Mikael?","Mikael Dolsten - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So I will only comment since this was a while ago that we introduced a hierarchy of PD-L1 cutoffs that were basically aligned what other current studies are using that allow us to study high, medium, or low. And we have sized the study appropriately.","Of course there is always in first line studies an issue that patient may crossover. But the unique characteristics of IO will allow you really to look at the benefit, given that you have this tail of patients that will stay responders if you've got a good mix of patient selection and study planning.","So we remain optimistic about this study. I should say that we also have included a high dose Bavencio arm that could offer a unique differentiation versus other PD-1 or PD-L1 lung cancer studies.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you for the background, Mikael. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just first for Ian, I think you've been one of the most shareholder friendly and proactive CEOs across the whole industry. But in light of some of the frustrations you've had around M&A, inversion, splits, et cetera, I wonder if you can discuss a little bit the succession plan for the CEO role? And the potential timing of that? And what if any structural changes you would still like to look at implementing at Pfizer during your tenure?","And then second, sorry to go back to the J&J litigation again, but maybe you can help me a bit on this. Maybe for Doug. Is it not fairly standard for companies to remove or adjust rebates on the loss of formulary positioning? For example, has Pfizer not engaged in that practice in the past? Or is it that you're potentially suggesting that there should be some kind of double standard for biosimilars with respect to that? Just because they don't have an equivalent to an AB rating just as yet? Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","Well, while Doug is thinking about that question. Succession, Pfizer, like all major companies, the board has a responsibility on succession planning. We have a robust succession process within Pfizer. And at due points they \u2013 that succession plan will become active.","My focus in Pfizer has always been focused on creating shareholder value for all the moves we make and all of the actions we take. And of course I'm extremely pleased about the maturing and \u2013 the maturing nature of our pipeline and the very promising assets that I see sit in that pipeline, which will come to market 2019 through 2025 or more. Thank you for the question. Doug?","Douglas M. Lankler - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. So thanks, Jeff. So rebate programs in and of themselves are accepted industry practice, so long as they are legally structured. We think J&J's practices in the character of the biologics marketplace in particular, where, among other things, there's no mandatory substitution at the pharmacy, and thus originated firms have substantial leverage over existing patients, make this a violation of the federal antitrust laws.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thank you, Doug. And can we take our last question, please, operator?","Operator","Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. Albert, on Xtandi, do you feel like commercial trends in prostate have stabilized in the U.S.? Or is there a risk that co-pay and reimbursement, et cetera, could be a headwind looking to next year? And then as you move upstream in the paradigm, what's been the progress with new urologists as first-time prescribers?","And then, Ian, real quick on the deal front. Where does geography fall in the priority list? I know previously it was more of a lever for inversion. But I wasn't sure if there was an objective, for example, to grow specifically outside the U.S. Thank you.","Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.","On the geography, once again, it comes back to value for shareholders and opportunity. A dollar made in China is worth the same as a dollar made in Europe.","So we're more focused on what does it do to our strategy? How does it strengthen the enterprises we're in? We've already got a very big international footprint. So how do we leverage that footprint? So all of those things come into consideration of how we produce value. Albert?","Albert Bourla - Pfizer Inc.","Yeah. On Xtandi, let me take the opportunity to speak about the investment thesis of Medivation and that will answer all your questions for Xtandi as I do.","When we bought the acquisition \u2013 when we bought Medivation, we said that the value drivers are, one, continue growth in the metastatic setting, primarily by growing prescription from urologists, as you said. The second was to obtain a broader indication in non-metastatic prostate cancer. And the third was to develop and commercialize talazoparib.","In the metastatic prostate cancer we are very pleased, because Xtandi total demand continues to demonstrate some growth. This quarter, we have 15% growth compared to the same quarter of previous year. Urologists were growing 37%, as we have predicted that we would be able to grow. As Ian said, there is an all-times high with approximately 1,700 urologists prescribing the product. This, compared to Zytiga, that prescribed almost 407, so very big difference.","In the non-metastatic prostate cancer, we were delighted with the positive results of PROSPER, two years earlier than expected. And as I said before, we are working very hard to file.","And for talazoparib, we had an extensive discussion before. And Mikael alluded to the very robust development program. So the fundamentals of this acquisition are very, very helpful.","We know that the next sales are lagging behind because of the Patient Assistance Program. So let me tell you where we stand with that. The program as a proportion of total demand was generally stable compared to the previous quarter, as Ian said. And as we stated previously, any change this year will be very gradual. And the reason is because all patients already enrolled in the program, they remain in this program for the entire calendar year. So there is not a possibility to have radical changes over there.","But we believe as we move to the next calendar year, that the patient assistance as a percentage of total demand will start normalizing. Thank you.","Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.","Thanks, Albert, and thanks for everyone on the call for your attention this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
