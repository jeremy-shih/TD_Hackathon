Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties' first quarter earnings conference call. The press release and the supplemental package were distributed last night, as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and accordance with Reg G requirement.

Although, Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. On current results are FFO per share for the quarter was in line with our prior forecast and we increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by a penny driven by operational improvements.","We leased 565,000 square feet in the first quarter, which is below our long term averages for this period. This level of leasing is not a reflection of the health of the market or the vibrancy of our tour and proposal activity, but it is due to the cadence of our lease expirations the lumpiness of our largely transactions as well the fact that we leased three million square feet in the fourth quarter of last year.","Our in-service office portfolio occupancy is now 90.4%, which is up 20 basis points from the end of the fourth quarter. We also had another quarter of positive rent roll ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter of 13% on a gross basis and 20% on a net basis compared to the prior lease, which was driven substantially by our California assets.","New investment and disposition activity was relatively light in the quarter, but we recently completed two major financings at very attractive terms which Mike who by the way is having a $4.5 billion financing week will discussed in detail later in the call.","Moving to the economic environment, U.S. economic growth continues to be a little sluggish with fourth quarter GDP growth estimates of 2.1% the employment picture also continues to improve incrementally with 98,000 jobs created in March, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5%. In the capital markets the 10 year U.S. Treasury also dropped around 30 basis points to 2.2% since the end of the last quarter.","So financial markets are reflecting increased skepticism over fiscal and tax stimulus related to the new administration the Federal Reserve has not altered its rhetoric on increasing rates at a more rapid rate in 2017. Notwithstanding current Fed posture given continued sluggish growth, low inflation, the uncertainty associated with federal fiscal stimulus and tax cuts and the current realities of demography we're not overly concerned about a sharp rise in long term interest rates and anticipate at least for now a continuation of reasonably healthy operating in financial market conditions.","I commented last quarter on the potential likelihood and impacts of proposed tax reform on Boston Properties business. So tax reform continues to be high on the agenda in Washington D.C. I will reiterate that the probability terms, timing and potential impact of such reform on Boston Properties is very difficult to project. Particularly with the recent challenges of ACA reform effort. Now given the growth in the U.S. economy the office markets where we operate have positive demand and healthy activity, but are in relative equilibrium given additions to supply.","In the CBDs of our four core markets and West LA, net absorption is projected to be 4.7 million square feet or around 0.8% of stock for all of 2017 while additions to supply are projected to be 6.4 million feet or approximately 1% of stock over the same period. Asking rents are projected for rise 1.5% in 2017 while vacancies projected increase 30 basis points to 8.3%. Our leasing activity remains active with pockets of strength and weakness, which Doug will describe later in the call.","In the private real estate market there continues to be a strong bid in size for high quality office assets in our core markets as once again several transactions were completed at attractive pricing over the last quarter. Notable examples are as follows. Starting in Santa Monica, 1299 Ocean Avenue at 206,000 square foot office building with an oceanfront location sold for $1385 of square foot and a 2.5% initial cap rate to a domestic REIT partnered with non-U.S. capital this is a record price per square foot for the L.A. region though the yield is low because the top two floors of the building are vacant. We think the stabilized cap rate is probably in the mid-to-high 4% range.","In Boston 45% interest in the Vertex building, two assets comprising 1.1 million square feet located in the Seaport District sold for $1058 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate to a sovereign wealth fund.","In Arlington, Virginia, Waterview a 647,000 square foot office building sold for around $711 a square foot, which was a 5.5 cap rate to a domestic pension advisor. This is also a record price per square foot for suburban Washington. So the major tenant to building is expected to relocate though there is term on the lease and the underlying sub market has material vacancy.","And lastly in New York, 245 Park Avenue a 1.8 million square foot, 50 year old office tower located near Grand Central and likely requiring some future renovation is being sold to a Chinese corporation for $1243 a square foot and a 5.1% cap rate. Otherwise our understanding this transaction is being financed with a $1.8 billion mortgage, which is around 81% of the purchase price at a rate of approximately four 4.5% for 10 years.","Given these examples and dialogues that that we are having, we continue to see strong private market interest from domestic and non-U.S. capital sources and high quality real estate particularly CBD office in our core markets.","So in summary given the relative steady state of the operating and capital markets where we operate over the last quarter, we're continuing to execute capital strategy, we've been employing over the last few years, which entails growth through aggressive leasing, selected development of prelease projects and targeted acquisitions of under that assets will protect the downside by keeping leverage low and financing development through asset sales and additional debt capacity from our NOI.","Moving to the execution of our capital strategy for the quarter and starting with acquisitions we continued actively pursue development and value added building investments though we are looking in all of our core markets L.A. remains the priority a given our desire to build on our presence in the market.","In terms of specific deals last week we committed to enter into a long term ground lease with the purchase option and to build MacArthur station residences, which is a 402 unit 24 storey residential project with 13,000 square feet of associated retail located in [technical difficulty] neighborhood of Oakland. Temescal is an increasingly desirable area of Oakland with limited quality rental housing and no high rise development and the complex provides residents with immediate proximity to the McArthur BART station with direct access to downtown San Francisco, downtown Oakland and Berkeley.","Likely renters will be commuters to downtown San Francisco given we expect our rents will be a 15% or greater discount to rents in the CBD workers in the hospitals that are located proximate to our site and or students at Cal Berkeley. The total cost of the project is approximately $265 million excluding land value that will be determined based upon a formula following stabilization and construction will not commence until mid-2018. MacArthur station residence is our first standalone and San Francisco residential project.","On dispositions were actively in the market with 500 East Street in Washington D.C. and in various stages of selling a handful of land sites and buildings in the suburbs of Washington and Boston. For 2017 we continue to anticipate projected total gross proceeds from dispositions in excess of $200 million.","Moving to development this past quarter, we delivered in the service to 15,000 square foot expansion of our Prudential Retail Center and remain active advancing our pre-development pipeline for projects that will start after 2017.","At the end of the first quarter our development pipeline consists of six new projects and three redevelopments totaling four million square feet and 2.3 billion in our share of projected costs of which 1.3 billion has been funded through the end of the first quarter. Our projected cash NOI for these developments remains in excess of 7% and the preleasing of the commercial component increased 6% in the quarter to 54%.","Looking forward in the development pipeline, we anticipate construction completion of the Salesforce Tower later this year with initial tenant occupancy in early 2018 and have already identified several projects to refill this important growth component for Boston Properties. As discussed in previous calls will be commencing a new headquarters for Akamai in Cambridge this month and over the next three years will likely add a new headquarters from Marriott, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, and MacArthur Station residences.","In aggregate these projects alone represent nearly two million square feet, $1.2 billion of cost on our share basis has extensive preleasing and we believe can be delivered at an initial cash return approaching 7%.","So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for growth and creating shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We're making good progress on our clearly communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And this growth of course excludes our recent new business wins and potential new investments for which we have significant capacity.","Let me turn over to Doug.","Douglas Linde","Thanks Owen, good morning everybody. The total market colors that I'm going to convey this morning is very consistent with our comments over the last few quarters, and I think it's really in sync with the overall tenor of the economy that Owen just described. Demand growth from technology and life science businesses are the primary drivers of positive absorption across all markets while lease expirations are dominating overall activity.","Base utilization by large institutional office tenants and the legal in the large financial services sector has stabilized though we continue to see space reductions stemming from design changes as lease has expired and there have been flow of growth in decline from smaller alternative asset management firms as Pacific Investment Strategies don't always work out forever. Under the current macroeconomic conditions, we believe the most dominant issue is the impact of new supply with ensuing tenant relocations versus incremental demand and the realities of the time needed to rebuild, reinvest and re-tenant existing inventory in all our markets.","Looking at the statistics from this quarter the size of the pool of the leases that's reflected in our first quarter same store portfolio was pretty small about 150,000 square feet in Boston, 100,000 square feet in New York City and in Washington D.C. and 240,000 square feet in San Francisco. The Boston same store statistics included a full floor deal of Prudential Center, which is actually cut on a low rise floor back in 2000 and late 2015, early 2015 and where the rents have declined from $76 to $61. So if you exclude this transaction we are actually up about 6% in the Boston area.","And in New York City the release of one of the low rise Citibank floors at 399 where the rent move from $92 down to the low 80's impacted those numbers and those that's what we've been describing would be going on at 399. San Francisco continues to benefit from the math of roll up that we've been seeing over the last couple of years and interestingly in D.C. this quarter all of the transactions were in Northern Virginia there were no D.C. proper deals that were in those same stores.","I'm going to start my regional comments with Salesforce Tower. I'm delighted to be able to report that we signed 100,000 square foot lease this quarter, which brings us sign leases to 960,000 square feet or just shy of 70% of the building. We have two continues blocks remaining floors 35 through 44, a 250,000 square feet and floor it's 51 through 58, a 170,000 square feet.","During our internal marketing call last week, we discussed half a dozen active proposals from 200,000 square feet to a single floor 25,000 square feet. The current discussions involve law firm some tech firms, working firms, and assortment of small financial services organizations private equity firms, D.C. firms and hedge funds.","We topped off the building a few weeks ago, but initial tenant improvement stocking and layout have yet to commence for any of the tentative sign leases, so we again we don't anticipate having any occupancy or revenue recognition in the building in 2017 as tenants physically complete their space we can start recognizing revenue.","Even though the spaces leased and in many cases we're paying rent. The available space left in the building is priced at the upper end of the market high 80's and up with our lowest floor being 35, we are offering a very attractive price relative to the other new high rise construction in the market.","During the last quarter we have been a handful of transactions in traditional inventory Embarcadero Center Four one market the ferry building that have all been completed over $90 of square foot as compared to our pricing expectations at the brand new Salesforce Tower.","Market conditions in the city certainly with previous quarters there are limited large blocks of public space and there continues to be a number of larger requirements in the market, but they're under 200,000 square feet not the 500,000 square foot tickets that we saw in 2014 and 2015. This quarter Google expanded by 100,000 square feet, the Auto Group took 130,000 square feet, Adobe expanded by 100,000 square feet, Slack took 200,000 square feet and we did our deals Salesforce Tower.","CBRE reports that there were 12 deals over 100,000 square feet in 2016 and there have been six deals year-to-date in 2017 over 100,000 square feet. So the story of following the San Francisco CBD will be the continued demand growth and tenant respond to the place of new construction.","During the first week in April, we signed another 62,000 square foot deal at Colorado Center, bringing our committed space in 93%. So Ray and our outside leasing team have brought the property from 65% leased to 92% leased in eight months. We have a number of discussions ongoing on the final piece of space. Our repositioning plans are close to complete and we're working with a local permanent story with a goal of commencing construction on the interior work by the end of 2017.","Overall, leasing velocity in the Greater West LA market has moderated slightly. So we were actually in discussions with one large tenant in the market with growth plans that we can no longer satisfy at Colorado Center.","Turning to the Boston region; we ended the first quarter with the issuance of our special permit for the construction of 145 Broadway the Akamai building. We are underway with the demolition of the existing 79,000 square foot building and 31 months away from delivering our new 486,000 square foot fully leased building. This investment will be added to our supplemental next quarter at a total GAAP cost of approximate of $375 million, but the budget is still evolving.","Our other near term opportunity in Cambridge will be in early 2018 and we have the opportunity to release 100,000 square feet of partly occupied space by Microsoft at 255 Main that is expiring at the end of this year. Not only is this in the heart of Kendall Square, but the space has its own dedicated entrance if a tenant is interested in expressing its brand.","The Cambridge office market continues to be very tight and expensive forcing tenants to consider alternative location like our hub on Causeway project. Across the river at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon, we are making significant progress leasing our vacancy. We complete our third lease at 120 St. James, 32,000 square feet and are negotiating another lease to 50,000 square feet which will bring the low rise building to over 75% leased and we have actively under our remain 50,000 square feet. There are not a lot of large expiration driven requirement in the Boston CBD market, so we expect leasing activity will be concentrated in transactions between 5,000 square feet and 50,000 square feet.","Rents are stable so depending upon the condition of the space, the landlord contribution to tenant improvement has risen. We are also in discussions on two full floors in the midrise and of comments our first prebuilt program in the building i.e. higher TIs in the hope of accelerating occupancy and our negotiating our first deals today.","At the hub on Causeway, we've signed a lease with Live Nation for 32,000 square feet, which will create another entertainment venue and we're seeing lots of interest for 175,000 square feet of office space, which is under development and will deliver in the first half of 2019. Then the demand is primarily technology to tenants that are either considering relocation from the suburbs in Cambridge [technical difficulty].","In our Lexington and Washington suburban portfolio we completed a lease for about 50% of our redevelopment at 191 Spring Street, where we hope to have initial occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2017. We've also responded to a number of built to super puzzles at our city point land holdings and if we were able to land one of those major lease commitments this would add to our investment pipeline for 2018 and beyond. In any of these projects get going rent will likely be an excess to 50 large as square feet growth.","I want to focus my discussion in New York this morning at 399 Park Avenue. Supply continues to come in to New York in the form of new deliveries in Hudson Yard and Manhattan West in the World Trade Center and the corresponding large blocks of space return to the market and buildings like 4 Times Square, 65 East 55th, 1271 6th Avenue, the Americas and soon 399 Park Avenue.","Landlords that are putting capital into other assets are attracting tenants. And space it is attractively we priced mid to high 80's starting rent is seems a very strong activity. While we're not anticipating office rent growth and we do expect higher concessions versus 2016 in our portfolio and 2017 and 2018, our repositioning activities are accelerating and we are offering products at varying pricing levels from the mid-80's at the base of the building to over $140 a square foot for our 40,000 square foot glass box with 13 foot finished ceiling and dedicated outdoor space.","In 2017, we're collecting $31 million, the expiring tenants at 399 Park. We get this space back at the end of the third quarter. There are a lot of mid-sized financial and business service tenants in the market, we're making proposals, we're going to lease space consistent with these economics that I just described, but in almost every case, we're going to have to demolish the space the existing improvement can't be reused and occupancy will not be until 2019, which will mean that the base will not generate revenue in 2018.","At 1590 53rd Street, which is currently out of service, it's also under heavy construction today. We've made a number of proposals on the 195,000 square feet of office space that's being rebuilt and can be delivered in early 2018, or optimistic that will have signed leases in place contemporaneously with the base building completion, but again revenue recognition is not expected until 2019. For marketing and brand building would greatly enhance in the lines, a brand to mechanical plant and tremendous outdoor on these on each floor.","Leasing activity on the space price was starting rent above $100 a square foot continues to be active as measured by the number of transactions, but size continues to be the real governor. In the first quarter, there were very few deals above 30,000 square feet that we are aware of a few 50,000 square foot plus requirements that will land next quarter above $100 a square foot starting rent. We have a few smaller deals under negotiation of the General Motors building and to preempt the question yes our large tenant with the 2020 lease expiration has been actively evaluating their alternatives and we do not believe they have made any decisions yet.","Finally in DC, the swap market fundamentals continue to be a challenge with significant available inventory and tenant favorable concession packages. Yeah, we are probably as busy as we have ever been pursuing new business, which involved long term forward leasing commitment. In addition to the 727,000 square foot headquarters transaction for Marriott we're in discussions with tenant for 70% of the office space we're permitting at 2100 Penn that's the 410,000 square foot office building with a 2023 delivery and we are now in dialogue with a tenant for 100% of our proposed new development in Reston Town Center, 1750, a 275,000 square foot office building.","And finally, we continue to patiently await word from the GSA, on their selection of a site for the 620,000 square foot GSA requirement. This quarter, we executed a 53,000 of at least with the GSA at our VA 95 Park, which is in close proximity to Fort Boulevard and we're discussions with a contractor for 70,000 square foot space in that same Park. And in Reston Town Center, in addition to build the super puzzle [ph] we have strong activity on a 38,000 square foot block of space which we have yet to get back, but will be getting back to the end of this quarter where we have multiple tenants competing for the space.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I just want to give a quick update on our contractual income that's coming from our lease up in our high contribution building. So as of the end of the quarter, we completed leases with annualize revenues of $62 million towards our target of $111 million, $24 million of that is in our 2107 projection.","Finally, we're now 54% leased on our development pipeline where we anticipate 2020 annual incremental NOI of $238 million upon stabilization versus year end 2015.","And with that, I'll give the call to Mike.","Michael LaBelle","Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I planned to discuss our recent financing activity earnings for the quarter the increase in our 2017 guidance as well as touch on a few assumptions we think are important for you to consider as you think about our 2018 projected earnings. I'm going to start by describing our activity in the debt markets, because we've been quite busy again this quarter including executing $4.3 billion of new financing commitments.","Earlier this week, we closed on a five year renewal of our revolving line of credit. We increased the size from a $1 billion to $1.5 billion and we improved our pricing. This extends out the availability on our facility from its prior maturity date in 2018 to 2022.","At the same time, we close on a $500 million, five year delay drop term loan price at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We have not borrowed under the facility and it includes a feature that allows us to delay usage for up to 12 months which makes it an ideal facility to fund a portion of our committed future development costs.","Our bank group that includes 16 of our trusted partners to help us put together this $2 billion in bank financing and we truly appreciate their continued support. The most significant financing that we plan to complete this year at the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue, the GM building. We own 60% of the building and it currently has $1.6 billion of first mortgage and mezzanine loans that expire in October of 2017 at an interest rate of 6%. We've been in the market for replacement financing to repay both the existing loans and provide additional proceeds based upon the significant growth in cash flow we've generated since our acquisition.","As outlined in our press release, we have entered into a rate lock and commitment for a 10 year financing of $2.3 billion at a fixed interest rate of 3.43%. Our share of the cash interest payment on the new facility will be $9 million less per year than the existing loan even though we're borrowing an additional $700 million. We expect to close the loan in early June when the current loan becomes open for prepayment without penalty.","Since we have been recording a non-cash fair value interest component on the current loan, which effectively brings the interest rate down to 3% this refinancing will actually be dilutive to our future FFO by approximately $0.12 per share annually. The refinancing will have a significant impact on second quarter results. First the remaining fair value interest on our balance sheet will be accelerated through our P&L and is expected to result in an additional $14 million of gain on debt extinguishment. Our 60% share of this is approximately $0.05.","Additionally the original structure of the deal required investments by the partners in the form of partner loans in lieu of equity. We have booking interest expense due to the outside partners loan every quarter and it is fully allocated to them through non-controlling interest. The net impact to our earnings of this is zero. We expect a pay off the loans as part of the refinancing and going forward both our interest expense and our non-controlling interest will be lower by the amount of the interest.","So starting with the third quarter of 2017, our consolidated interest expense will be much simpler to model and we expect a run rate starting in the third quarter of approximately $90 million to $95 million per quarter. In 2018 our interest expense will be higher at our capitalized interest will start to roll up with the delivery of our development.","In addition, we're in the process of finalizing documentation for a construction loan on the first phase of our hub on Causeway project in Boston. The loan will fund the vast majority of the remaining costs for the $284 million project where we are 50% owner.","So overall our share of our current development pipeline has $800 million of equity remaining to fund through completion over the next couple of years. As Doug described, we're starting the enabling work on our next Cambridge development and if several additional potential projects in the pipeline that will add to our capital needs. These three financing transactions provides funding necessary to complete our current development program as well as ample liquidity for future investment.","Now I want to turn to our earnings. For the first quarter, we reported funds from operations of a $1.48 per share that was right in line with our guidance. The quarter was impacted by $2 million of timing difference associated with the recognition of termination income for the tenant at the GM building we spoke about last quarter. We still anticipate earning the same amount of income, but a portion of it has been moved from the first quarter to the second quarter, which negatively impacted our earnings in the first quarter versus our guidance.","Excluding the timing change our FFO would have exceeded our expectations by about $2 million or just over a penny per share. This improvement emanated from a combination of about $1 million of higher portfolio NOI and the rest from service fee income.","As we look ahead to the rest of 2017 there are a few changes to our prior guidance. As I mentioned earlier our refinancing activity will result in a shift in dollars out of interest expense and into our non-controlling interest in property partnerships loan, but has minimal impact on guidance. We have reduced our guidance range for net interest expense, which includes debt extinguishment cost to $355 million to $368 million that represents a $0.13 per share savings.","However our guidance for deduction for non-controlling interest in property partnerships increased to $117 million to $132 million representing $0.13 per share of additional deduction from FFO, so net-net a lot of moving pieces, but no change in our FFO guidance from this.","In our same property portfolio, we have elected it to an early take back of 170,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue from Citibank. This space had a natural expiration date of September 30, 1017 Citibank has been in the space for a long time and will need to be demolished and then refit for a new tenant. Taking it back early allows us to start preparing the space for marketing with the goal of shortening the down time. It is possible we could take additional near term expiring space back if it is vacated.","The impact of this is a shift in revenue categorization from same property rental income to termination income. We will still generate the same amount of revenue, but will pull it out of our same property bucket. For this reason we have reduced our assumption for same property growth for both GAAP and cash NOI by 50 basis points and we increased our assumption for termination income to $21 million to $25 million for the year.","Overall we have increased our guidance range from last quarter to $6.15 to $6.23 per share representing an increase of a penny per share at the midpoint. The increase is due to better projected portfolio NOI.","As you start to look at your 2018 models there are three things that we think you should keep in mind. First is interest expense, we project our fourth quarter 2017 run rate to be $90 million to $95 million. We anticipate capitalized interest on our development destruct a run-off in 2018 as we deliver some of our larger projects like Salesforce Tower. Based on what we know today, we expect our interest expense in 2018 to be between $390 million and $410 million. As we bring our development income in the service there is an increase in interest expense.","Second is our same property growth. As Doug described, we signed leases for a significant amount of our NOI bridge, which we expect to contribute to solid growth in our same property NOI over the next couple of years, but remember that the impact of loss revenue from lease expirations at 399 Park Avenue will moderate our same property growth in 2018 the expected lost income from 399 Park from 2017 to 2018 equates to approximately 2% of our same property NOI pool.","And lastly as our development pipeline. We provided a very clear path of the projected growth in NOI from our development deliveries and our quarterly investor materials. Between late 2017 and end of 2018 we will be delivering some of the most significant projects in our pipeline. These include completing the lease up of 888 Boylston Street including the occupancy by Natixis in 155,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2017. The initial occupancy of tenants in Salesforce Tower beginning in early 2018 were occupancy is projected to face in through 2019 and the delivery of our two residential projects in Cambridge and Reston in early 2018.","So revenue recognition for these projects will not all referring 2018 it will be split between 2018 and 2019 as tenants occupy their space. We have contractual leases that are projected to generate incremental NOI growth in 2018 of $25 million to $30 million from 2017. The remaining lease up is projected to generate additional income in 2018 and into 2019 as full lease up is achieved.","The last thing I want to mention is that we are planning our triennial BXP Investor Conference that fall. The day will be on October 4th it will be in Boston and we'll be sending out more information to you soon. We look forward to seeing you all there and as always appreciate your support.","That's completes our formal remarks. Operator if you can open up the lines for questions that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could focus on the leasing spreads in the quarter, bit difference across the markets. Can you maybe talk through your expectations going forward and whether the net in gross leasing spreads with representative of the mark-to-market in those markets for you guys right now?","Douglas Linde","Sure Jamie, this is Doug. Again I think I give a little bit of color on what you saw this quarter and again it was a pretty small portfolio relatively speaking that pushed their way through in terms of when the new cash rents commenced. I think that you will continue to see very strong numbers in San Francisco as we complete the million plus square feet of rollover that we had in a Embarcadero Center starting in late 2015 that going into 2016 and 2017.","I think you'll see a reasonably strong number in Boston as you see the rents rolling through at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon Street which is where the bulk of the vacancy is because those rents were so low and you recall when we bought the property, we told you that the rents were $35 to $38 at the base of the building and in the mid-50s at the face of the top of the building and we're obviously doing deals in the mid-50's the base and then in 60's, 70's and 80's up of the top of the building.","In the Washington D.C. portfolio the challenge with the mark-to-market is that every single year we're able to negotiate leases with 2.5% to 3% increases. So as those increases occur obviously the rents go up so generally when you get to the end of the lease in Washington D.C. there's not much of a jump in the mark-to-market.","And then in New York City, as I've described before it's very, very hit or miss and so at 399, which are we've been very clear about, we're basically going to be moderately higher overall in that building on the 500 plus or minus 1000 square feet that's rolling over because the when you're in a bit lease to Citibank it with at the end they're obviously their terms where they were bumped and then where would they be in new calculation payment.","And then we'll see good increases at all of the space that's rolling over at 767 the General Motors building and then we'll - the other portfolio it's very space dependent on their spaces that are way above market and there are spaces that are there way below market.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And just a final question. Can you just talk more about the bay area market conditions in Silicon Valley versus the CBD in terms of tenant demand and how would supply is in back in those different market?","Owen Thomas","Sure. I'll start now and let Bob Pester make some comments as well. Overall we have - I'd say we've seen a very consistent stream of demand in the CBD and the vast majority of has been growth. And while that the ticket size has declined from the large scale 500,000 to 700,000 square foot requirements that were growth requirements that we saw in 2014 and 2015, there's a pretty strong number of 100 plus 1000 square foot new tenant demand drivers that is in the CBD.","In the Silicon Valley, there are two or three primary drivers of growth that have been occurring for the past three or four years. Google is the first, Apple is the second and to some degree Facebook has been the third, they have been exceedingly large absorbers of space. There are a lot of opportunities to build new buildings in and around the Silicon Valley, which are for the most part have been tear down and while there is a plethora of midsize and other companies that are there, I would say that those are generally not we see young growing companies those are stable engineering firms that have a more stable and a less expansive growth trajectory than the three companies that I described.","And so I would say that overall there's been less incremental demand down in the valley, now there are obviously been new companies that have gone down there like LinkedIn that's been a big grower on a relative basis compared to the first three they're smaller. Bob, if you want to add anything.","Robert Pester","Yeah. I think if you talk to the brokers in the Silicon Valley they would say the quarter was somewhat flat, but there still were several transactions that happened I mean Amazon took almost 550,000 square feet in a couple of projects. Applied materials to go another 28,000 square feet in Sunnyvale, Bosch signed a lease in Sunnyvale for 104,000 feet. Adobe is one more to be looking at downtown San Jose for expansion of another 300,000 to 400,000, and Google who has been rumored quite some time in downtown San Jose looking at the Diridon station site that Temescal has potentially could be in the market for a million square. So overall, I would say the activity is still pretty good from an expansion standpoint down there.","In San Francisco, just in the past month we've had three tenant go through sales force tower all four between 150,000 square feet and 300,000 square feet and we have another one coming by Friday Tech tenant for 300,000 feet. And that's probably the best activity of the large tenants that we've seen at any one time in the marketplace in the CBD, I would say in the past two and half years.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chau with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chau","Hey everyone. Just curious, I mean I know you've touched on the deal flow in the private markets and still very attractive cap rates that you're seeing. Just curious in LA, outside of Santa Monica deal that you mentioned. What are the opportunities you're seeing in that market to expand beyond Colorado Center now that you are 93% or so prelease or leased there?","Owen Thomas","Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, it is a focus for us in terms of the new investment activity. We do have a broader geography perimeter that we're focusing on beyond just Santa Monica and I think as described in prior calls, we've been looking at things imply this country city, a couple of other communities and West LA. I would say right now, we are chasing with various levels of intensity probably half a dozen different types of investment. Some are existing building that require some rehabilitation or value added and in a handful of situations we're also looking at development.","Though West LA will remain a priority for us in terms of new investment and we intend to stay disciplined, we don't have a target by year-end or by year-end 2018 of a certain dollar amount that we want to invest. We want to do - we want to continue to do, what we did in Colorado Center, which is to invest in the property at a we think a reasonable price and create value with asset level for shareholders. We're not going to make investments just to grow in LA.","Vincent Chau","Right. Okay. And that market has seen some slowdown in job growth for a couple months now and it sounds like the commentary was if there's some moderation in certain market leasing activity perspective. Is that having any impact on the opportunity set things like that or cap rates end market besides obviously the same market that you mentioned?","Owen Thomas","I think the pricing is at elevated levels in West LA. But honestly it's true in other markets that we operate in, the capital markets are very robust, I've described deals have on prior quarters and other markets like Washington that are weaker than Santa Monica that are also high levels relative to history on a per square foot basis. So I don't think some of those underlying fundamentals that you're describing are impacting the capital market for buildings in West LA.","Raymond Ritchey","Hey Owen","Owen Thomas","Yes, sir","Raymond Ritchey","This is Ray. I just did that virtually everything we look at in Los Angeles is off market transactions, because if we get a book on something we know it's probably going to be overpriced. So we're really focusing on identifying opportunities that haven't hit the market yet and the Boston Properties story is being very well we're see by some of the local smaller developers as great partners for their vertical development, so we're excited about that.","Vincent Chau","Okay. Thanks. And just last question from me, I just going back to the East Coast, Reston Town Center just sounds like there's good demand there and you mentioned that one of the blocks the smaller ones that you're working on. Just curious, we saw kind of an interesting article out there just talking about the paid parking transition and some tenants complaining about how that's hurting their business, so I just curious to be any commentary on that.","Owen Thomas","Yes. So we did implement paid parking at Reston Town Center at the beginning of the year. As you know Reston is an urban location, it has structure parking primarily, and there is going to be the arrival of mass transit to the region and certainly not uncommon for areas with this kind of density to have paid parking. We are utilizing a state of the art parking system that is being used in cities all over the U.S. and actually the use of these systems is growing around the U.S.","In Reston specifically the system has been adopted by a 140,000 users so far. Now that being said as you suggest certainly not all of our customers some but certainly not all of our customers have expressed some concerns about the system or simply having to pay for parking and we are continuing to evaluate our execution and make adjustments to ensure that Reston remains preeminent location for business and resident in Northern Virginia.","Vincent Chau","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bellaman","Hey, it's good morning. It's Michael Bellaman here with Manny. I was wondering if we can go back to your discussion during the call about private capital and you made mention of dialogue we are having. And I'm just curious if you can elaborate a little bit on the type of dialogue you're having there is it do you purchased properties, it is the sell additional properties and can you just delve a little deeper into those sorts of conversations and what you're hearing and learning from them?","Owen Thomas","So let me just say Michael. First don't read anything into that. We are having dialogues of capital sources as we should be, but you shouldn't read anything more into it than other than that. But look as you might expect onshore and offshore investors that are interested in Class A office, they're interested in partnering with us, purchasing building, investing in our development, and we talk to those kind of groups there are intermediaries that work with those groups that also approach us about such opportunities.","And so that in addition to watch to seeing the transactions that are going on in the market, and I try to describe them for all of you in each quarter, we are having some direct dialogues with these folks. But as I mentioned, our disposition targets for this year are more in the $200 range.","Michael Bellaman","So you're looking at predominately any big acquisitions with Capital Partners and I guess how they think about those acquisitions versus how you would be underwriting them?","Owen Thomas","How the Capital Partners would underwrite acquisitions versus how we would underwrite them?","Michael Bellaman","Yeah I mean just an element of you know if you've had discussions with Capital Partners it's seeking some of these larger assets that have come to markets, I guess how aggressive are they willing to underwrite versus what you're willing to do or are they really seeking your lead and how do they think about on leverage returns versus you?","Owen Thomas","Yeah. Well, I'd say that generally Michael as you know we haven't been acquiring stabilize assets without upside at the cap rates where the market has been trading over the last several years, if anything we sold more than we bought in that kind of market environment. We did these very significant joint ventures with north just a few years ago to raise capital for our development pipeline.","So when we look at acquisitions there are more things like I would say like Colorado Center where the building initially with 66% lease, the cap rate was quite low, but upon leasing and then rolling the existing tenants to market the yield on the investment is much higher than where stabilize building will trade. So in general we haven't been prepared to purchase buildings at the yield that I described earlier in the call, and therefore we haven't done a lot of acquisitions joint ventures with these groups.","Michael Bellaman","And then just a question and maybe for LaBelle just on the GM building refinance, can you talk a little bit about sort of the underwriting of that assets, so where was it targeted from a leverage perspectives to underwritten value a coverage perspective to cash flow and then of proceeds how much are you going to be able to pull out on to properties balance sheet versus help for some of the redevelopment efforts and tenant work that you're doing in the building?","Michael LaBelle","So honestly really don't want to touch on the characteristics of the financing until closes. It's not going to close until June, so we're still kind of going through the process, but you know we've got a number of institutions that are sharing and what they have underwritten and agreed to lock in the commitment with us.","With regard to the excess proceeds there's a pretty significant amount of closing costs, because we've got to - we anticipate that we're going to be paying mortgage tax and obviously we underline it around hedged, so if the closing costs are probably north of $40 in total. And then my expectation is that we would hold back somewhere between $50 million and $75 million dollars for CIs and capital improvements at the asset level.","So if you pull out $100 million or $120 million from the $700 million of excess proceeds and you take our share, and you're talking about $300 million, $275 million that we would be able to distribute to ourselves and you know some to our partners obviously to fund the remainder of our development pipeline that we have as well as you know future development pipeline.","Michael Bellaman","Can you give me a range on leverage level at $2.3 billion that you've targeted and trying to figure out how to leverage the asset is to get the rate that you were able to lock in?","Michael LaBelle","I would say that the leverage is low, look this is fully investment grade institutionally price loan at these credit spreads. You know we haven't completed an appraisal yet, but there's certainly been an analysis of it and you know our view on how we finance these assets is that you know we want to maintain a reasonable amount of leverage, but we want to put sufficient capital on the assets so that we are borrowing at very, very attractive rates, and it's unity kind of get up into you know beyond the kind of BBBs on the CMBS into the DDs you start to get into a credit spread that it significantly higher than what we can borrow from the corporate side. So we kind of shy away from that.","So the LTVs for investment grade, CMBS kind of range depending on the characteristics of the asset, this asset obviously has great cash flow characteristics, long term leases and still has a lot of built in growth, because of the below market in place leases.","Michael Bellaman","Great, thank you.","Michael LaBelle","Yup.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One.","Tom Lesnick","Hi guys, good morning. My first question has to do it's just general activity with the GSA and the contractor community, I think you guys mentioned one lease with the GSA and then conversations with the contractor of VA 95, but can you comment overall about what kind of optimism you're seeing in that community, and it's way ended now that Trump is approaching 100 days.","Owen Thomas","Ray you want to take that.","Raymond Ritchey","Sure. There's still a lot of people waiting on the sidelines, I can't tell you how many tenants at Annapolis Junction which is our project up near NSA that have proposals from us contract appended. So first of all, I want to confirm that it's our belief that the budget will get resolved this week and have minimal impact of any on the real estate market, so that should not be concerned. But there's still a tremendous amount of demand on the contracting side especially in Intel and defense, we think that those sectors will come back very strong under Trump Administration. Life sciences, social services maybe not so much, but fortunately with our focus in Northern Virginia we're in really good shape to take advantage of a recovery market there, but the headline is still a tad uncertainty, but the prospects look very good for increased demand on the contractor side.","Tom Lesnick","Appreciate that. And then one last one on Colorado Center, I believe you mentioned that one of the remaining few spaces had been leased subsequence at quarter end. Am I correct and understanding that there's just once space left?","Owen Thomas","Yes, there is one block. And we have - we could do that we could do a deal there tomorrow on that space we're just trying to make the right decision in the last piece of space.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. That's helpful thanks guys, appreciated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street.","Jed Reagan","Hey, good morning guys. Can you give us an update on the entitlement process at the Oakland residential side and then does that deal signal that you may be interested in Oakland office eventually?","Douglas Linde","Bob?","Robert Pester","We are fully entitled on the open side as of a couple of weeks ago, and we've looked in downtown Oakland, but before at office opportunities that I just don't see it is something that we would have an interest in at this point.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And separately you mentioned that New York City leasing tempo of loss views accelerating, I mean to what extent you think that's a function of overall market health improving or are those more BXP's specific factors and then would you say market rents are falling for spaces above a hundred bucks a foot in New York at this point?","Owen Thomas","John you want to take that?","John Powers","I think the market has been pretty flat here, the availability rate didn't move in the first quarter, move one tenth of 1% in Manhattan and the leasing velocity was up just a shade from the 12 year average, so it's pretty flat.","Jed Reagan","And about the sort of high end market rents any changes you're seeing there?","John Powers","Yeah, I think there's more - there's a little more interest in the high end market rent and there has been, I think that the sticker shock that was there or year or two, is not necessarily they know, but it's all on the margin.","Jed Reagan","Okay, appreciate that. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Aslakson with Stifel, Erin, I apologize.","Erin Aslakson","No worries. Yeah, so good morning. Quick question on, I heard the commentary, I guess preliminary commentary on 2018, when do you expect same store NOI growth is actually start pick up for BXP?","Owen Thomas","I think that our same store growth has continued to be positive. The cash same store was over 4% in 2016, it's a little bit less based upon our projections in 2017 because we're - we've got this big rollover that we mentioned, that Doug mentioned we've got basically we're going to lose $30 million from year-to-year. So there's other growth in the portfolio we still believe we're going to have positive rental rate growth obviously in 2017 and also in 2018 and just going to be more moderate.","And I think that the cash growth actually in 2018 will outstrip the GAAP growth. We've built in a lot of these early renewals that we've done where in California, the Embarcadero Center and Cambridge that we've kind of been blending in that had 2018 expiration. Cash rents are going to start to hit that in 2018, so I think the cash will be better in 2018 than the GAAP picture. But if you think about 2% down kind of starting, I mean again we're going to be positive, but until we release that 399 space, which we believe won't occur, won't hit the books until 2019, I think seeing real acceleration beyond kind of more of an inflation level is going to be difficult.","But we did comment that we anticipate the $110 million to come from the hand full of assets, which is again only eight or nine assets, I mean $110 million is about 7%, so we are expecting 7% growth just from that select group of asset over a two and half year approximate period. And then there's the rest of the portfolio that obviously is going to grow at some level. So if you kind of look out through that whole period I think we will see good, good same store growth it's just again a little lumpy because the expirations and when they are.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Couple of questions, Mike I was wondering if you could give a little bit more of a feel for when you talked about the development NOI that's going to coming in 2018, 2019 there being a split kind of an early sense of what that split might look like?","Michael LaBelle","This is hard for me to say right now, I mean I think what I said was $25 million to $30 million is signed leases that we have a good projection for when those tenants are going to take occupancy. So we feel very confident about that. There is additional leasing that we should be able to get done in 2017 more tenants that will need to be an occupancy in 2018, I think will do some more leasing at Salesforce Tower for example for tenants they need to be an space sometime in 2018, but some of those tenants are going to be in 2019.","We're talking the tenants that have kind of both requirements and again we can't book revenue until this energy is in a new development. And if you look at the residential property, so we've got 600 plus or minus units to deliver we're delivering them in the first quarter of 2018, our expectation is there is a 12 to 24 month lease up timeframe for that type of residence of development obviously the expenses for residents of development you have to kind of experience them early on.","So I would think that we're probably going to get 25% to 30% of the NOI out of those residential developments in aggregate in 2018, and then the rest will come in 2019. So those are kind of two of the bigger development that we have, 888 Boylston Street is going to be basically going to be end of 2017 and there's only 4.5 left, that I think that we should be at the lease that and get occupancy sometime in 2018, those are the big one.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful. Just last question you also you talked about it could take some additional near term expiring space back I assume you meant that 399 Park. Based on what that possibility is today, what would the financial impact would that be specifically would this create another adjustment down in your same store NOI guidance if you did this?","Michael LaBelle","I think it could I mean that's why I said it. And we to the extent that we can get the tenant to pay the full amount of rent. So we get the space back and we get start to work on this space, we may elect to do that, if we think is going to help us lease this space on the back side of this more quickly. So obliviously we have our rule that we don't include termination in common same store, and we do that because it can be more volatile, and we want to get that with the same store is, but in situations like this unfortunately feel away. So we try to be very clear about the ins and outs, because it's not a reduction in the overall revenue that we're going to be getting or expected to get in 2017 is just into the bucket.","Nick Yulico","Right. Any square footage amount you can give us, so you can now put a parameter on this.","Michael LaBelle","There could be another couple hundred thousand square feet.","Nick Yulico","Okay.","Michael LaBelle","As we get closer to the expiry. Right I mean in the expiry of these leases that are in August and September they're get less - they're less terminations,\/ is just like time.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, Good Morning. Mike, so just continue on the 2018 conversation. You had outlined cap interest coming off next year that's going to cause the GAAP interest rate to increase. From a GAAP perspective is not a cash, but from a GAAP perspective. Should we expect the NOI coming from those developments to equally offset the cap interest or is there going to be drag so that as word revising our models or updating them we're probably going to see a negative impact as more cap interest comes off versus GAAP contribution from NOI from the developments next year?","Michael LaBelle","I mean the developments are generating a yield as around 7%. So it's well in excess of what our capitalized interest rate is with the currently around 4%. So that won't be a drag, it'll be an improvement.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is, as you guys doing these redevelopment and you look at expanding or activating more of the base of the buildings clearly restaurants are saying you saw Esso Green invest in their restaurant at the base of one way under belt. From a tenant perspective, do they really care as much whether there's a more key type restaurant at their base or as long as they have a good food offering that what they're after and then the second part of that is from an economic standpoint other Marquee restaurant the same as putting in a bunch of lower price point restaurants or there's an economic bias of one versus the other.","Michael LaBelle","So I'm going to Bryan Koop answer that question relative what we did with eagerly at the Prudential Center, which I think he'll give you some contact of what we're doing in our some of our assets?","Bryan Koop","Yeah. So we are consistently seeing the customer, the tenant looking at power of how do they attract your talent to their location, and the restaurants and the total mix of not only the base is a building, but the entire neighborhood is becoming more important and like never before we've seen companies do analysis on this in terms of what that mix is about the demographics of the neighborhood, and how they're going to use it in their strategy in talent.","But comes right on with the response that we've received from the repositioning of the Prudential Center with the addition of Eadly [ph] versus the food court we had before, which was absolutely a strong performer, one of the best in the country the response from our customers has just been really outstanding from all our existing clients.","We're seeing the same thing at the hub as well where they focus on the geography of neighborhoods right, and with our additional anchor that are going out today we're seeing increase in terms of what does that play in terms of how they're going to use the office space. We have one particular user who's very focused on the fact that we landed Live Nation. They see it as a place that they can further events and again the track talent for their customers for their internal purposes.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But from your perspective a Marquee brand versus I mean Eadly does high volume by the economics to you the same or it's better with an Eadly type versus a more formal Marquee type?","Douglas Linde","I don't know what the economics of a blue concept are exciting that's what you're describing. But I can tell you that high end restaurants have exceedingly high upfront costs and there's so there's a long payback associated with achieving or returning as opposed to a more I don't know you to use the word and kindly but a pedestrian kind of a concept. So as an example we are talking about more of a food all at six in avenue and I would expect that the investment will be far different than the kind of investments that would be required for three or four or five Michelin star restaurants, and the revenue will obviously be different and the return in the early period of time will be significantly different as well.","Owen Thomas","What Doug saying about our key versus what their brand name, that more pedestrian. Each situation is different, but what we've seen here is that the desire by our client than this we have a lets we have a top chef below their space isn't necessarily as important as only think the bulk of their population wants.","I'll give an example, so we have earls coming to the Prudential Center the response by earls which is a chain out of Canada has been just outstanding from senior executives that are top firms at the Prudential Center, and it doesn't have to be that Marquee top chef to get a result that you're looking for creating a great place.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, that's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks good morning. I just wanted to clarification on your guidance change, I realize now a few items cancel each other out, but excluding those items you still have a 5% gain from the debt extinguishment, but your guidance for the full year only increased by $0.01, so it looks like the guidance overall decline on your core business, can you just clarify that?","Douglas Linde","So the gain on our debt extinguishment is simply accelerating the fair value interest that we would have already gotten had we let that loan run through its natural maturity of October 1st, so that was in our guidance, we were expecting to get it in the third quarter, because it's simply the fair value component of our interest expense. So as I said the GM building has an interest rate of 6% on a cash basis, but on a GAAP basis the interest rate is 3%, so we have the positive 3% that we put in every quarter to bring it to fair value.","So now that we are going to pay off the loan in June, we have to accelerate the rest of that piece, because it's sitting on our balance sheet, so it has become at the positive. So it's really just timing from third quarter to second quarter that's all of it.","John Kim","Okay, got it, thank you. At Salesforce Tower appreciate the updates on the leasing interest, and just wondering if you still feel comfortable with the building being fully leased upon completion as they did a few quarters ago.","Michael LaBelle","As I've said, we've got good activity, I don't know it would be fully leased by completion, but I think we'll be well along by the end of the year.","John Kim","Okay. And then Owen, I think you've discussed at a recent conference being more reserved about selling your prime assets in being market timers at this time in the cycle. Can you just elaborate on why this is the case particularly as you see potentially more discrepancy between private and public market valuations?","Owen Thomas","Yeah, well a couple of dimensions to that, I mean first is capital need you know you've seen our leverage ratios, we just completed $4.5 billion of financing we've put away our unfunded development capital need with this and have created capacity for additional investment our overall leverage levels remain low, so we don't have a need per se for capital right now.","And then as we look at the market, I talked about this in my remarks you know we are - we don't see a big spike in interest rate in the near term, we're continuing to have sluggish growth. We're certainly expect at some point to have an economic and valuation cycle for real estate, but I think the timing of that is right now, it is difficult to divine and from what we see you know we continue to believe we're going to have a constructive operating in capital market environment for the - at least for the near to medium term.","So for all though and I talked a little bit about where pricing is in our lack of desire of taking on new assets that these you know flourish cap rates. So for all those reasons you know we haven't done any what I'd call major asset sales. We've been selling $200 million, $300 million of assets a year but we haven't done a major asset disposition since the north just joint ventures we did a couple years ago.","John Kim","And you mentioned the sale potentially of suburban assets in D.C. and Boston, any update on New York, suburban New York?","Owen Thomas","No we are not actively in discussion selling anything in New York, in the New York area at the current time.","John Kim","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Colorado Center, the that you mentioned or talked about, are those contingent on redeveloping the property and what's your sort of plan redevelopment budget for the properties?","Douglas Linde","None of the leases that we have signed are contingent on doing anything from a legal perspective. We have an expectation that we've set with our tenants that we're going to do the right thing by the property and we've shown them the conceptual plans and then the architectural changes that we're going to be making and we've told the city of Santa Monica we can tend not doing these things, and we're going to get this stuff done you know sometime in the next 12 plus months, and it's somewhere between $12 million to $20 million probably is that sort of big picture ballpark redeveloping budget.","Manny Korchman","Thanks. And then on Salesforce Tower, I think you mentioned amongst the potential tenants set co-working companies, can just give us an update of view on how you think about co-working in sort of a user space especially in trophy asset like that?","Douglas Linde","We have been a supporter of the co-working platforms, we have a handful of leases with we work and we have been in discussions with other operators. We have consider - we consider that co-working phenomena for lack of a better word as positive for the office markets, these companies have aggregated demand from individual users that we as a major landlord have a more difficult time doing direct leases with, they've aggregated this demand and created significant net absorption in most of the markets where we operate. And so we think it's been a positive for us.","And then lastly, we think the tenants when they're in our building actually are positive for the building. We think they create energy and activity around the space and we've been positive about it. We continue to monitor the industry carefully, there are evolutions going on, some of these groups are doing more business with corporations, as opposed to support a larger users rather than individuals and we're certainly monitoring that and we are considering additional leasing with some of these groups and some of our assets. But again the good example Bob you might want to comment, we work is in 535 and we think which is a brand new building we completed a couple years ago and we think it's been a positive.","Robert Pester","Yeah, they actually refer to that as their flagship in San Francisco, and it's been extremely positive on both the building and the surrounding marketplace still looking, now looking at space where to cross the street at 560 mission, because they can't get any more in 535, because it's fully leased. And the experience we have at the minute in a Embarcadero Center which has been very short, because they just opened earlier this year has been nothing short of phenomenal, they leased out major blocks of spaces to companies like Twitch and few others and actually are potentially looking at more space in Embarcadero Center.","Manny Korchman","Thanks very much.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to our host for closing remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Thank you thank very much for you time and attention at Boston Properties.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending. And have a good day."],"3676":["Boston Properties, Inc.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would like to now turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay, thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. Our focus today in addition to market conditions and strategy will be on the 2016 guidance we provided in our release last night and a further discussion of our growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.05 above consensus and $0.06 above our guidance. We have increased our full year 2015 FFO guidance by $0.06 per share and provided you a projection for 2016 FFO per share over 2% above 2015 estimates. Our 2016 projected FFO growth would have been 4%, excluding the dilution from the asset sales that we conducted this year and we will have next year.","Further, on our most recent Investor Relation materials, we outlined that for 2017 we see the potential for $80 million in same-property NOI growth over 2015 from a select group of our assets, as well as an additional $72 million in annualized NOI from developments by the end of 2017. We own and manage many significant buildings with large tenants, several of which are rolling over in 2015 and \u201816. And these larger spaces can take time to backfill. Further, we are planning proactive investments in some of our properties such as the retail of the GM Building and the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue, which have short-term dilution impacts, but long-term benefits to our company\u2019s earnings. Though our projected 2016 FFO growth is more modest for these reasons, we believe Boston Properties has the potential to deliver material NOI growth in 2017 given our lease up opportunities and development underway. Through all of our comments on this call, you will hopefully get a more detailed understanding of the progress made to-date and executing on these growth opportunities.","Now, turning to the economy and the operating environment, though we had a clear volatility spike in the financial markets in August driven primarily by China economic growth fears, our views on the U.S. economy have not changed materially over the last quarter. U.S. GDP growth is steady, but tepid with third quarter growth announced yesterday slowing to 1.5% and approximately 2.5% growth projected for all of 2015. A similar story exists for employment, where 142,000 jobs were created in September, which is lower than the average for the past year and wages are growing at around an annual rate of 2.2%. As evidenced by the jobs data in corporate earnings, certain sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing a challenging business environment, particularly industrial production and energy given low oil prices. Our assets are located in coastal markets that are not as directly affected by weakness in these sectors.","Office property market conditions remain healthy and improving. Office net absorption remains steady with 13.9 million square feet absorbed in the last quarter and 1.2% of stock absorbed over the last year in major U.S. markets. Construction remained just above long-term averages of 2.1% of stock and annual rent growth was approximately 4% nationally over the last quarter and positive, particularly in San Francisco across all our major markets, except downtown Washington D.C. We leased 1.3 million square feet of space in the third quarter having completed 89 leases and our occupancy remained roughly flat at 91.3% for the quarter.","The private capital markets for real estate remained strong in our core markets as well. Interest rates continue to be favorable with the 10-year U.S. Treasury currently trading just above 2% and transaction volumes and pricing remain at elevated levels. We continue to see strong interest from domestic and offshore investors in Class A office assets. There is, however, a significant pipeline of real estate currently in the market and pricing levels maybe tested this fall given the supply of product, higher volatility in the public capital markets and the prospect of an interest rate hike before year end. For all of these reasons, our fundamental capital strategy has not changed. We are continuing to sell selected assets to fund special dividends and developments, which we continue to deliver at lower prices per square foot and materially higher yields than where existing assets are trading.","Now, moving to the specific execution of our capital strategy let me begin with acquisitions. We continue to evaluate new acquisitions but are finding pricing challenging and uncompetitive from a financial return perspective with our development opportunities. This past quarter, we did close on the previously contracted acquisition of the 50% interest in Fountain Square at Reston Town Center we did not own for $206.5 million. The pricing of the acquisition was a 5.5% cap rate on 2016 NOI and $545 per square foot.","We also remain active on dispositions. Since our last call, we completed the previously described sale of a 50% interest in 505 9th Street in Washington, D.C. for $318 million and a land parcel in Gaithersburg, Maryland for $30 million. We also just placed under contract to a user Innovation Place in San Jose, California for $207 million. Innovation Place is comprised of four existing buildings totaling 538,000 square feet. Three of the buildings are currently vacant in the fourth \u2013 with the fourth becoming vacant in 2016. The site has a total of 26 acres and can support 537,000 square feet of additional development. It is our expectation that the user will build additional structures on the site for which we will be engaged as development manager. This is an exciting sale for Boston Properties, in that it generates $207 million in sale proceeds, represents a gain of approximately $78 million, reduces the overall vacancy of the company and creates a new client relationship and development assignment for us.","Assuming Innovation Place closes as scheduled before year end, we will have sold $743 million in assets on a gross basis and $584 million assets on an our share basis in 2015. Our total projected 2015 tax gains from sales would be approximately $285 million and could result in another special dividend this year. It is our expectation that we will not have additional sale activity in 2015. However, we will continue to be opportunistic with asset sales in general and evaluate targeted sales of non-core assets for 2016.","Turning now to developments, we have had a very productive quarter executing our pipelines. Starting with deliveries, we placed in service Annapolis Junction 7 from our active development pipeline. The building is a 100% leased to the GSA and it\u2019s generating an unleveraged initial cash yield of 8.3% on our investment of $17.5 million. We were also able to move two important projects from our predevelopment pipeline into our active development portfolio this past quarter. 88 Ames Street is a 22-story 164,000 square foot, 274-unit Class A urban multifamily development with street level retail located adjacent to our successful Kendall Center property in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The project will cost approximately $140 million to develop and will be delivered in 2018.","Further, we received our entitlements to commence the development of the Signature Site, a two tower, 514,000 rentable square foot residential development located in our highly successful Reston Town Center community. The Signature site comprises 508 residential units and 24,000 square feet of associated retail space and preleasing discussions are advanced for the retail component. The property will cost $217 million to develop and will be delivered in 2018. 88 Ames Street and the Signature Site are forecast to generate an average unleveraged initial yield of approximately 6% upon their delivery in 2018.","We have also advanced several of our predevelopment projects in Boston closer to actual development. Preleasing continues in North Station and it is our expectation that we will be able to launch the podium phase of this project in the fourth quarter. Further, we executed amendment to our ground lease related to the 100 Clarendon Street garage, which provides with a payment of $37 million for a lease extension to 99 years, our commencement of the management of the Back Bay station, as well as an option to purchase sites, which require entitlement above the garage and stations. This is an exciting investment opportunity for Boston Properties over the longer term.","Our current development pipeline has 14 projects in all four of our major regions and is comprised on an hour share basis of 4.7 million square feet and $2.7 billion in total development cost. In the aggregate, the commercial space in our development is 59% preleased. These projects will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2015 through 2018 at a projected unleveraged cash yield of over 7.5% for the office component and around 6% for the multifamily. We have 90% of the cash required to complete these developments on our balance sheet and they will add approximately 4% to the compound annual growth of our FFO through 2018.","Let me now turn over the discussion to Doug for a further review of the property markets and our operations.","Doug Linde","Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. While our leasing and our overall investment actions are pretty influenced by what we view is long-term perspectives on the various market conditions, you are going to hear a lot less about this from me this quarter. And I am going to really spend most of my time talking about the factors impacting the next 12 to 18 months and the issues in our portfolio market conditions, the space that we are working on to lease or re-lease, how we are going to achieve that significant incremental NOI that Owen just described from our portfolio, as well as the growing contribution from our ongoing development investments. That\u2019s going to be the focus of my comments.","A couple of comments on our \u2013 on some of the supplemental first though. So overall, leasing activity in the third quarter picked up from the second. We were slightly more than the second quarter by about 100,000 square feet. Those second generation statistics had some interesting SKUs and that I sort of I wanted to highlight. In fact, each of the various regions had something going on with it. So in Boston, there was a pretty significant uptick and that was really from two transactions. The first was a lot of leasing that was done in Cambridge. Those \u2013 leases were actually signed in 2014. And then there were a number of leases at 200 Clarendon Street and the increase in the net rents on all of those transactions was over 100%.","Interestingly, San Francisco looks pretty muted. And the reason for that is two fold. The first is that there was a large renewal at Gateway that was done in 2013 that was actually 60% of the square footage that was in the stats. And then the EC office number interestingly, while it was only positive 25% on a net basis that was because there was a 5-year renewal that was done in 2012 on about 50% of the square footage in the EC and that was done at $50 a square foot with dollar bumps. Interestingly, we have just completed the lease this quarter, one floor above that lease where we did a same as is 5-year renewal for the starting rent on the new transaction is $70 with 3% increases. So you can sort of get a sense of the dramatic increase in rents in San Francisco just over the past 3 years.","In DC, we have a large law firm renewal completed in \u201814 that became effective this quarter and the rent went from 46 net to 38 net, but that\u2019s on a last contractual rent number to the beginning contractual number. So 2.5% increase is the actual GAAP rent is actually higher than $46 over the term 15-year lease. And in New York City, there was a former city floor that was re-leased at 601, where the rent went from $109 to $79. And with 540 supplemental where we did a 20,000 square foot deal at base of the building where the rent went from $135 to $70. Just to gauge any concerns, are our mark to market in New York City right now, as it stands in 2016 is over $9 a square foot and in 2017, it\u2019s pretty flat and I will talk about what\u2019s going on in \u201817 as we get into 3.99.","So let me begin my formal remarks on our markets with Midtown Manhattan. So during the quarter, we did 12 deals for about 90,000 square feet. Ten of those deals had starting rent over $90 a square foot and seven of those deals were above $100 a square foot. The bulk of our availability and rollover in the portfolio in the next few years occurs in spaces that come in rents in excess of $100 a square foot. While it\u2019s a small subset of the Midtown market, it continues to be a very healthy and growing one. Activity is expanding, overall there has been an average about 870,000 square feet of leases done per year since 2011, over $100 a square foot and about 30% of that is new. And in 2015, we have already seen 900,000 square feet of activity above $100 a square foot and about 35% of that is new.","Nonetheless, the transaction size continues to be small with a preponderance of the activity of leases under 10,000 square feet for non-renewals and there are relatively few deals above 40,000 square feet for renewals. So you have the temper what\u2019s going on in that market given the scope of the transaction sites. We are fully leased at 510 Madison, no rollover until \u201817. We are working through those law firm rebuilds that we have been describing at 599 Lex and we are going to be getting back the three floors of swing space in 2016, late \u201816 where we already have leases out on two of those floors, with rents over $90 a square foot. At 250 West 55th, we have leases out on all of our remaining pre-builds and we have half lower deals on two of the remaining three available floors. We expect to have full revenue contribution by the third quarter of \u201816 at 250 West 55th.","We are seeing heavy traffic across the entire portfolio, but with very limited current vacancies, most of our transactions revolve future availability. At 767 Fifth, we are getting back 80,000 square feet in July of 2018, the expiring rent \u2013 excuse me, the expiring rent is under $100 a square foot and we expect that space to lease for over $180 a square foot. We are actively marketing the former FBO space, which will be available for lease in early \u201917. And we have active interest from tenants ranging in size from 14,000 square feet to the entire 65,000 square foot unit. At 399 Park, there are 640,000 square feet expiring in \u201817. We have 280,000 square feet of the base leased to Citi and we are in lease discussions on 180,000 square feet with starting rents equivalent to Citi\u2019s expiring rent in the high 80s.","There was a 97,000 square foot block in the lower portion of the building. We have got a proposal out on 75,000 square feet and over $105 a square foot. There is 150,000 square foot of block in the middle of the building, we are going to get that back in September of \u201817 if leased it about $100 a square foot and we expect to achieve rents over $115 a square foot. And the final Citi block is of 110,000 square feet of below grade space and that\u2019s leased at about $50 a square foot. At 601 Lex, we are in the planning stages of a major repositioning of the retail in the low-rise building. We are working on a plan to vacate the entire 140,000 square foot office building including 70,000 square feet that currently under leased to Citi. This is going to result in \u201816 and \u201817 additional vacancy as we renovate that portion of the complex. We have no vacancy right now at 601 and so the New York team is actively looking at ways we can control currently leased space. So, we can move forward with these plans. This quarter, we actually took back a floor at the top of the building in order to accommodate the potential repositioning. This is high contribution space, which is going to result in the diminishing of 16 occupancy and revenue, but consistent with our core strategy and philosophy, we are making decisions with the long-term to maximizing the value of the asset and the portfolio.","In DC, our development at 601 Mass opened in September, a little bit early. The office space is 86% leased, the retail is 100% leased and the income contribution will ramp up in \u201816 and fully contribute in \u201817. This development is being delivered at an initial stabilized cash return in excess of 8%. While the delivery impacted citywide brokerage statistics negatively this quarter, our view really is that the overall market conditions in the CBD of Washington, D.C. haven\u2019t really changed much. The district continues to be very competitive since there just hasn\u2019t been a lot of significant increase in user demand.","We completed another major renewal of our law firm deals at 1330 Connecticut where the incumbent tenant renewed for 15 years on 212,000 square feet of approximately 240,000 square feet currently occupied. That new rent is going to commence in \u201817. The rent rollup is over 25% on a net basis. As part of this transaction, we will be using 52,000 square feet of 1333 New Hampshire space, which is across the street as swing space. This space is technically leased, but it\u2019s not going to be revenue-producing until the repositioning of 1330 is over. And that space would ultimately rent for over $65 a square foot growth today. We are making steady progress on all the availability at our JV assets at Market Square North, 901 and Met Square. Activity in Reston continues to be very strong, though with limited availability again in our portfolio. Activity really is involving, extending and expanding tenants by accommodating takeovers and sublets. All of this is in the context of starting rents above $50 a square foot in the urban core. Our portfolio has a vacancy rate of under 3%. Overall, Reston vacancy is 14%, Roslyn is over 30%, Tyson is over 18%, and that\u2019s just actual vacancy not availability.","The weakest subset of our DC portfolio is the GSA-related properties in Springfield and Annapolis Junction. And while the user groups want to need space, the GSA mandated densification and to-date, the lack of appropriations in the defense complex have severely limited current demand. We hope that the changes with the House of Representatives and the changes with sequestrations and the new budget deal will in fact add to the demand for the defense complex and improve our leasing prospects in these properties. The Boston CBD continues to be a really good market as supplies dwindled over the past few years. Although, there is speculative development in the Seaport and we are obviously adding inventory to the Back Bay with 888, demand is currently lease expiration driven.","At 120 St. James, that\u2019s the low-rise of 200 Clarendon area, we have 180,000 square feet of availability and we have responded to three full block proposals in the last 90 days, each anticipates full utilization of the space in 2017. At 200 Clarendon in the high-rise, we completed 88,000 square feet of leasing this quarter, including one floor in that 150,000 square foot block from 44 to 48. While we have seen interest from a few multi-floor users, the high end demand in Boston has typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease this space in smaller units. As we said previously, we expect to have a rent commencement on all the space towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. At 888 Boylston Street, we have topped out the steel, we are 71% leased. We actually completed our first retail lease this month with an 18,000 square foot multi-floor user. We have extensive conversations going on with retailers in all of the remaining retail space at 888, which we expect to open in 11 months and a few months after, that will open a few months before or excuse me after the office space opens in the summer of 2016, and so 888 will have full contribution by the end of 2017.","Since we have no availability in Cambridge, I just have a few comments there. Asking rents are now in excess of $80 a square foot and in spite of the recent volatility in the life science industry, as well as some job reductions around specific companies, there continues to be a flow of new tenants looking for a beachhead in Cambridge, which is home to both the life science and technology businesses. Lack of available supply continues to be the story. The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority has made this submittal to the city for up-zoning of our Kendall Square project and we hope to have some clarity on our ability to build more space by the end of the year. There is no real update on the Volpe site disposition. The GSA schedule suggests an award in early \u201817, which means no additional spaces at Volpe for four to five years.","In Waltham, that metro market continues to get stronger driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 19 leases in our suburban portfolio, 150,000 square feet and we had a similar amount under lease negotiation right now. All of the space at 10 CityPoint is committed, rents in excess of $50 a square foot for the top floor. The project will deliver in mid \u201816 at a cash return over 8%. Rents have increased 25% over the last 18 months at our CityPoint project. While there is no speculative construction currently underway, our reservoir north renovation where we basically scraped the building other than the structure is very much underway and we anticipate rents in the mid to high 40s of significant upgrade from the expiring rents that we had in May in the low 30s. Again, this won\u2019t occur until 2017.","At the \u2013 finally, I want to talk about San Francisco. At the June NAREIT meeting, there was a real focus on demand in San Francisco and whether we were seeing signs of concern. Now, we\u2019ve lay off the Twitter and the limited activity in the IPO market, I think it\u2019s become another renewed topic of conversations. Well, between 2011 and 2014, the annual CBD leasing activity averaged about 9.3 million square feet and absorption was about 1.5 million square feet a year. Through the end of the third quarter this year, there has been about 6 million square feet of completed transactions and 1.4 million square feet of absorption. Leasing activity continues to be healthy. Tech demand has averaged about 55% of this activity, where there has been sublet space, it\u2019s been small pockets and it\u2019s leased for strong rents.","Last quarter, the big news was that Apple grabbed the sublet space at 235 Second. Our largest sublet is our Morgan Lewis space at EC 3 stemming from the merger with Bingham, 125,000 square feet expires in August of 2016. We are negotiating leases for three of the five floors right now and have multiple proposals out on the rest of the space. We get the space back, as I said in August of \u201816. The anticipated rollup is over 100% on this 125,000 square foot block. There is speculative new construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 333 Bush and Block 40 are all under construction adding about 1.4 million square feet, but the vacancy rate is under 6%, total availability is under 8.5% and after an FAR deposit in October, the Prop M Bank is currently under 1.75 million square feet and that\u2019s it. Down in the valley, Apple committed to another 800,000 square feet in the new development. They are purchasing additional land in North San Jose, Palo Alto Networks is growing, Google is growing, Aruba is growing, Toshiba is growing, General Dynamics is growing, Silver Spring Networks is growing they have all committed to large new expansions.","At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 116,000 square feet of leases during the quarter. The largest deal was 41,000 square feet and the mark-to-market was over 60% on a gross basis and over 100% on a net basis. None of these transactions are in our same-store stats for the quarter. We are now actively engaged on over 350,000 square feet of full floor tenants, including the five currently vacant floors, a 117,000 square feet of vacancy with an average starting rent on those floors of over $80 a square foot. The largest tenant is only 51,000 square feet. The anticipated rollup is in excess of 50% on a gross basis and over 75% on a net basis on all of that space. In total, we have over 1 million square feet of near-term lease expirations and vacancy with an average rent of $53 a square foot at EC. At 535, we are now 91% leased and we have leases out on all but 4,000 square feet. The last three deals were a foundation and insurance company and a law firm.","The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter of \u201816 at a cash return of over 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our original performance. We have 700,000 square feet of available space at Salesforce Tower. Currently, we have leases out on 100,000 square feet totaling 4.5 floors. We have active or multi-floor discussions defined as multiple letters of intent being exchanged proceeding with asset managers, hedge funds, VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage companies and other non-tech service firms that encompass more than 475,000 square feet. Only two of these tenants are existing customers at Embarcadero Center. These requirements are all lease expiration driven for occupancy at the end of 2017 or early 2018. In summary, activity at Salesforce Tower and the rest of our city portfolio is robust as much as we had seen since we bought the property in Embarcadero Center back in 1998.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I am going to briefly cover our earnings for the quarter and projections for the rest of the year, but we will focus my comments primarily on our 2016 guidance that we provided. I would also like to point out that we added a new page to our supplemental report this quarter that provides our key earnings guidance assumptions. We are hopeful that this in conjunction with the guidance explanations that we have historically included within our earnings press release is helpful.","Starting with our quarterly results, as you can see from our press release, we reported third quarter FFO of $1.41 per share. That was $0.06 per share, about $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance. The results included unbudgeted lease termination fees of $5.6 million. This includes the $3.6 million payment we received related to our Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claim. So far this year, we have collected over $8 million from our claim, which we believe has the remaining value of about $2.5 million, though we don\u2019t know when or if we will collect it.","We also recorded $2 million of termination fees for taking back a floor from a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue that Doug mentioned. The remaining $5.4 million of our earnings beat included $900,000 of better than protected service fee income and $4.5 million from the portfolio. In our portfolio, our operating expenses were about $1.5 million below our budget, all of which we expect to incur in the fourth quarter. And we delivered two developments this quarter earlier than we expected resulting in $3 million of portfolio outperformance. We projected both of these developments to deliver on October 1. So there is no impact on our fourth quarter projections.","Our projections for the fourth quarter are generally in line with our prior guidance. The only meaningful changes are that we will benefit from the early acquisition of Fountain Square that will add about \u2013 it will add about $2 million for the quarter. However, we projected to be offset by operating expenses being moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and the loss of income from terminated tenants. For the full year 2015, we are projecting funds from operations of $5.46 to $5.48 per share. Again, this represents an increase from our guidance last quarter of $0.06 per share at the midpoint reflecting the outperformance we recorded in the third quarter.","Now, I would like to spend a few minutes on 2016. Last quarter, we discussed a few larger items that would impact our 2015 earnings, including asset sales, in particular the sale of 7 Cambridge Center to its user The Broad Institute, which will result in the loss of $13.2 million of NOI. The Broad Institute is a unique situation given that they negotiated this purchase rate as part of the build to suit development 12 years ago. And the rent contained two components, a base rent which was used to calculate the purchase price and a large tenant improvement investment that was fully amortized over the term of the lease of additional rent. We do not have any other tenant purchase rights like this in our portfolio. The impact of this and our 2015 sales are partially offset by the acquisition of Fountain Square. But in aggregate we project a $16 million or $0.09 per share decline in 2016 NOI from 2015 related to net sales activity.","Last quarter, we also discussed the impacts on 2016 from downtime in between leases for some larger lease expirations such as Citibank vacating 140,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, FAO vacating at 767 Fifth Avenue and lease expirations at our Gateway project in South San Francisco, 100 Federal Street in Boston and in our Washington, DC buildings. This has tempered our same-store growth for 2016, but will be more than offset by growth in the remainder of our same-property portfolio and incremental NOI from the delivery of a portion of our development pipeline.","In Boston, we project occupancy gains at the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon Street and our Suburban Waltham buildings. We also will reopen the Boylston Street side of the shops at the Prudential Center in the second half of 2016, including Eataly and the completion of the retail expansion, which is 100% leased. This income will start to show up in the second half of 2016 and will be fully in place in 2017. As Doug mentioned, we have good activity in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and expect stabilization in 2016. Year-over-year, we project 250 West 55th Street to contribute an incremental $15 million to $20 million of NOI in 2016. We are also projecting incremental income gains at 599 Lexington Avenue and in Princeton. Doug also described the activity at Embarcadero Center. The potential revenue from the five vacant floors he mentioned is over $9 million and our anticipated rollout from expiring leases through 2017 is over $20 million. Some of this is projected to commence in 2016. Overall, we project our average occupancy remaining relatively stable between 90% and 92% during 2016 and then improving with positive absorption in 2017.","On a GAAP basis, at the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we project our same-property NOI to be relatively flat compared to 2015. The most significant headwinds are at 601 Lexington Avenue, 100 Federal Street and 757 Fifth Avenue, each of which is a consolidated joint venture. If you include only our share, our 2016 same-property GAAP NOI performance improves by 100 basis points. On a cash basis, our same-property projections are much better. We have a significant amount of free rent burning off at 680 Folsom Street, 250 West 55th Street, 101 Huntington Avenue and South of Market. And also, we will experience the cash impact of the rollup in rents from early renewals we completed in Cambridge and in San Francisco. We project our cash same-property NOI for 2016 to be up by 1.5% to 3.5% from 2015. Again, if you only include our share of consolidated joint ventures, this growth goes up by approximately 100 basis points. So cash NOI growth of 2.5% to 4.5%.","Properties not included in the same-property portfolio include our 2015 and 2016 development deliveries. These developments represent a total investment of $1.1 billion and are projected to provide an aggregate averaged unleveraged, stabilized cash return of 7.75%. We project an incremental NOI contribution to 2016 from these properties of $34 million to $40 million and growing to over $70 million by the end of 2017. Non-cash rents, including both straight-line rent and fair value rents will be down significantly in 2016, as much of it will convert to cash rents. We project our non-cash rents to be $30 million to $50 million in 2016. That compares to our current 2015 projection of $90 million to $95 million. ","We have four maturing mortgages in 2016 that total $580 million and we project interest expense savings of $8 million assuming we complete a $500 million financing in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is baked into our interest assumptions for the year and we currently project interest expense of $400 million to $420 million for 2016. This is net of capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline of $38 million to $48 million. We have not made any other financing assumptions, though we continue to monitor the market in advance of our $3.6 billion of aggregate debt expiring in 2016 and 2017. We continuously evaluate the costs associated with an early refinancing, which could occur later this year or in early 2016.","Any transaction would result in a significant prepayment penalty there will be a charge to earnings in the period we complete the refinancing. We also continue to layer in forward starting fixed rate hedges targeting a corporate financing in late 2016 and our $1.6 billion loans on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires in late 2017. With our acquisition of our partner\u2019s share of Fountain Square and the sale of 505 Ninth Street combined with transition between leases and some of our consolidated joint ventures, we project the FFO deduction for non-controlling interest in property partnerships to be lower in 2016 at $95 million to $115 million.","So overall, we project 2016 funds from operation of $5.50 to $5.70 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are $0.13 per share higher than 2015, which reflects approximately $0.22 and growth from our development deliveries, $0.10 and growth from our share of portfolio NOI, $0.08 of lower interest expense, offset by $0.09 of dilution from asset sales, $0.04 from higher G&A expense and $0.14 of lower termination income. The dilution from selling assets in 2015 has an impact on our 2016 growth profile. If you exclude the impact from asset sales, our FFO growth at the midpoint will be approximately 4% even with some of the transition we are seeing in the portfolio. Our portfolio was well-positioned for additional growth beyond 2016 and we anticipate improving our occupancy, adding incremental NOI from the existing portfolio and from our development investments. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you can open the line up for questions that will be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","John Guinee here. Thank you very much. First, a couple of questions for Owen and then one for Ray Ritchey or maybe this is Doug. Back in 2010 or 2011, Princeton Corporate Center came on, you sold it, you backed out what are your thoughts on Princeton Corporate Center these days?","Owen Thomas","Well, it\u2019s called \u2013 we call it Carnegie Center, John. ","John Guinee","I am sorry.","Owen Thomas","That\u2019s alright. And I think the basic fundamental philosophy down there is that we have been able to find the real niche with the pharma, biotech and some other industrial companies, many of whom are growing and we have been able to both capture additional occupancy, as well as additional users where we are building a building as an example for NRG right now and our plans are, at the moment to continue to have a thriving 2.5 million square foot campus, where we have growing tenants though where we hope to see rising rents and we can accommodate future growth.","John Guinee","Okay, great. Ray Ritchey, you are deep in the teeth of the GSA deals, your TSA lease. Can you kind of talk through whether we are in the first inning of the GSA movement or are we halfway through? And how many more feet are you going to see GSA move into state-of-the-art metro-centric buildings in the near term?","Ray Ritchey","Thanks, John. First of all, in TSA, obviously we are involved in a protest there. So, it\u2019s like we will not comment on that except to say that we would not file the protest, if not we didn\u2019t feel good about our position. Number two on GSA in general, you may have saw where DOJ just signed a lease for over 800,000 square feet on a to-be-built complex here in the NoMa District of Washington, and I think that\u2019s indicative of the fact that current landlords or existing landlords have a hard time meeting the space allocation needs. And that these larger requirements more likely than not will be forcing new development. And as we control several sites that would be responsive that we are encouraged that that maybe the case. Having said that, we are still aggressively pursuing renewals at a number of our buildings where leases expire in \u201816 and \u201817 and because of the strategic nature of those specific buildings, we feel really great about the renewal prospects for our buildings.","John Guinee","Great. And Owen, are you going to be running with us Wednesday morning at NAREIT?","Owen Thomas","Looking forward to it. Thank you.","John Guinee","Alright, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Good morning, guys. In your remarks on sales force, you spoke about the non-tech sort of demands from users. What are you seeing on the tech demand side of things? Has the sales force sort of naming rights been an issue or are you seeing larger source of requirements than you thought you would when you built that?","Owen Thomas","I think what we are seeing is exactly what we would have anticipated seeing with regards to the building. This building is in the premier office address in San Francisco at this point. And given the relatively higher rents that we are asking relative to other parts of the city and other properties, we anticipate that the market demand would be geared towards the financial services companies with lease expirations driven occupancy needs. And so I think we are seeing exactly what we would have expected to see.","Manny Korchman","Doug, while I have got you on the line, FAO, you mentioned perhaps a single user, perhaps multiple users do you have an appetite one way or the other?","Doug Linde","I think our appetite is to maximize the revenue and maintain the image of the building. And if it comes in the form of two or three transactions, that\u2019s okay and if the right brand awareness organization wants the whole 65,000 square feet and they are prepared to pay what we consider a fair rent, we will do deal with them as well.","Manny Korchman","Great. One quick one for Mike, Mike, what\u2019s driving the big G&A ramp next year?","Mike LaBelle","I am sorry, what was that?","Manny Korchman","What\u2019s driving the new G&A ramp into \u201816?","Mike LaBelle","So, on our G&A, we have really just assumed cost of living adjustments on our 2015 general G&A. And then we do have a long-term compensation plan that is identical to the plan that we had in \u201815 that is in there and the difference is that the plan that is rolling off from \u201813, the unvested piece of that is just less than the charge for the first year for the plan that is projected for \u201816, but that plan is identical \u2013 projected to be identical to what the plan we had in \u201815 is. There is really two pieces.","Manny Korchman","Alright. Thanks guys.","Mike LaBelle","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","Good morning, guys. Owen, you mentioned that asset prices maybe tested this fall. And I am just hoping you guys maybe elaborate a little bit on that statement and just what dynamics you see it play there and do you think there are certain of your markets that might be more vulnerable than others?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So, we have had as you know now several quarters\/years of I would say very strong capital market conditions, particularly for Class A assets. And from all the evidence that we have of deals that we are involved in and deals that we watch, that market conditions still exists. However, I made the comment, because there have been a few new things that have happened over the last quarter. We had some clear market volatility, downdraft in the equity markets in August, which is now recovered, but clearly the volatility levels are higher. I am sure that\u2019s had impact on some investors. We are closer to the end of the year. So, everyone has got a different belief on what interest rates are going to go, but we are closer to a possible December rate hike. And then lastly and anecdotally, a lot of what we see and what we hear from the industry, there is a significant pipeline of assets for sale, both office assets and other asset classes currently in the market. So, I just make the point, again, we have no specific deal evidence of change, but there are a few of these moving currents, which could have some impact on it and we will have to see.","Jed Reagan","Any evidence\u2026","Doug Linde","Yes, I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything in my remarks that are targeted towards any one specific market. I think we have mentioned before, the asset \u2013 attractive asset pricing that we are seeing exists across all of our four markets. And these factors that I mentioned, I think would have impact on all of them.","Jed Reagan","Okay and so no evidence yet of bidding 10 smaller or maybe overseas buyers taking a step back?","Doug Linde","Not specific, no.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And also your stock has been trading at a pretty wide discount to NAV here recently. And I am just curious whether share buybacks are on your radar at this point and just how you are thinking about that option versus say new developments?","Owen Thomas","We have obviously been watching our stock price, Jed and we talk about it and we have even addressed it with kind of our board and talked about it. And our view is that we have got a great use of capital for our developments. If you look at our liquidity and you look at our capacity, which is actually significant given our leverage, we certainly have capacity, but then you look at the impact, the accretion impact of doing a share buyback of $1 billion or $1.5 billion or even $2 billion and it\u2019s not that meaningful to us given the fact that we think we are going to have alternative investment opportunities and continue to have new development given our shadow pipeline over the next few years. So, we don\u2019t want to give up that capacity for some sort of short-term gain when we have great opportunity in the future.","Jed Reagan","Okay, it sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. So, you have done a good job of laying out the $80 million of potential NOI upside through year end \u201817 and provide advice on this in the past. And just listen to your comments, it does sound like maybe there is some 2017 NOI that might be moving out. So, I guess my question is two parts. Number one, can you just bring us up to speed on, of the $80 million, how much of that is in the bag? And number two, when we think about that $80 million, is there some movement in \u201817 that might be a drag again?","Doug Linde","Jamie, this is Doug. So, it\u2019s hard for me to sort of describe what is in the bag or not in the bag. I mean, as an example, I described and might put some numbers around all of the rollover that we have in Embarcadero Center. And I also \u2013 I put some perspective on the activity we have in Boston and we have previously talked about what\u2019s going on at 100 Federal Street. All of that, I think is activity that we are confident is going to progress in the appropriate manner, but none of it is \u201cin the bag\u201d. But I \u2013 we feel pretty good about it. With regards to \u201817 and interestingly I actually went through and looked at our entire portfolio from 2017 to 2020, because I figured somebody \u2013 someone might ask if there are any other really large rollovers in our portfolio. And in \u201817, aside from the square footage that I described at 399 and I think I gave some clarity on the fact that much of that space is likely to going to be leased prior to those leases expiring. In fact we may get some leases done in early 2016 on that space. I think that we are feeling relatively comfortable that, that space is not going to be a drag on our earnings on a going forward basis. And then when you skip until the 2018 and we have space at $45 a square foot, a big chunk in Cambridge that\u2019s rolling over. I wish we can have the space back today, so I can lease it today. Then in 2020, we have the Estee Lauder space at the General Motors building 757 Fifth that\u2019s just going to rollover, which has got an enormous amount of embedded upside in it. So on a going-forward basis, while I think we will continue to see downtime between major lease expirations, it\u2019s nothing like what we are seeing at the moment where we have the concurrence of both the assets in Boston at 200 Clarendon Street, 120 St. James, changes at 100 Federal Street, what we are doing at 601 and what\u2019s going on particularly with the retail space at General Motors building all happening within the same 12-month period of time.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then \u2013 so I guess to your comment, you feel very comfortable on some of it, can you quantify of the $80 million, how much is that?","Doug Linde","I will be able to quantify it in future quarters.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then turning to Mike, do you have a sense of what your guidance means through 2016 FAD?","Mike LaBelle","Well. Yes. I mean obviously, I had some comments there relative to our same-store cash being higher. And I made some comments on what our free rent and straight line rent is going to be which is significantly lower than it\u2019s going to be in 2015. The other thing I would point out is we have done a lot of leasing in 2015 that has \u2013 in \u201915 and that was just a lot of this early renewals and take-backs and deals that we did. So the leasing transaction costs that we are seeing in 2015, I think are higher than what they have been historically because there has been so much volume of leasing. So as I look at our occupancy projections and I look at 2016, I mean I am looking at probably doing 3.5 to 3.7 million square feet of leasing in order to achieve our projection. So you can throw whatever transaction costs you need to throw at that based upon some renewals, some being new. But if you use $45 or $50 a square foot, you are talking about $160 million, $170 million. And then we talked about our cash rents and our CapEx, I would expect it to be similar next year to this year. We expect this year to be somewhere in the $70 million range, I would expect that to be similar. We do have some more significant work going on like this year we had Hancock lobby and we have started the 599 lobby and the elevator work at 599 and that\u2019s going to go also into next year. And we will do some work at 399 next year and some other buildings. But overall, I mean I would see it being an FAD of somewhere around $4 somewhere $3.80 to $4.20, something like that per share, which is higher than this year by probably 10% to 15%.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, great. And then just final question, you mentioned a good pipeline of leasing for Salesforce Tower. And I know you have said in the past that tenants in those markets tend wait closer to occupancy date to sign leases, what\u2019s realistic in terms of what we should thinking about for when you start to put some more leasing on the board there?","Doug Linde","Well, as I said we have 4.5 floors that we are currently in lease negotiations. That means we have sent a lease and they have sent comments back and we sent comments back to that. And I would expect that that 4.5 floors we will be done close to the end of the year, maybe before the end of the year. And then we have got proposals that we are trading back and forth with a multitude of tenants, so I said 475,000 square feet. Do I think we are going to have any of those physically leased before the end of the year given that it\u2019s November 1 on Monday or November 3 on Monday, probably not, because it generally takes 90 days to 120 days to sign a lease unless there is a crucial need for delivery of the space sooner than that. And obviously we are not going to deliver the space until early 2017. But we think we are going to have consistent theories of leases to announce in the first \u2013 in the second quarter of next year or with all the work that we have going on right now. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that?","Bob Pester","I will just go on a limb and say that we will be 100% leased when the building is completed.","Jamie Feldman","Alright. Thank you.","Arista Joyner","Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Thanks. Good morning. I am just trying to get over that last bold statement there. While we are on a bold statement in San Fran, can we talk about the status of your potential development at Fourth and Harrison?","Owen Thomas","Sure, I will give a couple of brief remarks and then I will let Bob describe it. So we purchased an option or we entered into an option agreement on Fourth and Harrison and we have done our \u2013 we made our preliminary submission for the city and there area a series of entitlements. And I will let Bob describe them in more detail that need to be garnered in order to start that project. One of them is referred to as the Central SoMa plan, the other one is a Prop M allocation. And Bob you can describe sort of the timeframes associated with going to that process.","Bob Pester","So the Central SoMa plan is an area that affects from Market Street, south of the freeway and our Fourth and Harrison properties included in it. It\u2019s anticipated that plan will be approved sometime next year, it was supposed to be this year, so it could potentially drag on. Prop M is probably the bigger factor that affects us because there is a 10 million square foot pipeline of planned projects. And we are one of those projects that are going have to compete for that square footage until Prop M either gets voted out or some other type of solutions realized. We just submitted our preplanning application a couple of weeks ago. We have got a meeting with Citi in two weeks to review the plan that were very preliminary as far as going through the planning process. And at this point, we really aren\u2019t certain what\u2019s going to be approved or have to change with the project, but we will keep you posted as it materializes over the next couple of months.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. I appreciate that. Shifting over to New York, can you remind me on the rework development over \u2013 across the river, is that a fixed rent deal with bumps or do you guys have any kind of a profit-sharing arrangement like some other landlords have done?","Doug Linde","It\u2019s called Dock72 for future reference and John Powers, I will let you describe our arrangement without talking about the specifics.","John Powers","No, there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a straight lease for 240,000 square feet. It does have increases in the lease over the 20-year period. There\u2019s no percentage of profits or any \u2013 anything else.","Ross Nussbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Your line is open?","Brendan Maiorana","Good morning. So Mike, probably for Mike LaBelle, so your same-store cash NOI growth that you shared, 2.5% to 4.5% seems many fully higher than these bare our expectation was an you talk last quarter about some of the pro-active space that you are taking back, which, I think, in aggregate, you said maybe hurt the \u201816 in run rate by about 200 basis points. Is that still the case or is maybe some of that drag that you initially expected in \u201816 not going to show up?","Mike LaBelle","No, that $34 million of drag is still expected. Again the cash growth is coming from 101 Huntington Avenue. We did the lease with Blue Cross Blue Shield, had pre-rented it in 2015 and a little bit of cash rent, full cash rent in 2016. That\u2019s a big lease. The leases at 250 West 55th Street and 680 Fulsom all had a lot of free rent during 2015, no free rent in 2016. And then the renewals, I mean, in Cambridge we did three big renewals in 2014 and 2015 where we increased rents from $45 to $70 plus. And the bump in the cash doesn\u2019t come until the natural lease expiration of those leases, which was in 2016. And same thing in San Francisco with some of the early deals that we did on some of the firms in Embarcadero Center and it just has a meaningful impact on the cash flows and the growth in them. So, that\u2019s really where it\u2019s coming from.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. And then with respect to the $80 million of growth kind of by the end of \u201817, my recollection from the slides that you guys have provided is that there were some of those assets, which are actually what we are talking about a little bit of a drag in \u201816 and then become growth thereafter. Is there, on a net basis, is any of the $80 million really positively contributing to \u201816 or is that really kind of \u201817 and thereafter growth?","Doug Linde","Some of that will be \u2013 will start to commence in \u201816. So, as an example, if we lease 5 vacant floors of Embarcadero Center rent at $80 a square foot, I think Mike said it was $9.5 million and if per chance all of those leases commenced in August of 2016. We get the bump in 2016 and it would obviously be there for \u201817 as well. So, the $80 million is the totality of the incremental cash flows and some of it will be occurring earlier than the end of \u201817.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. And then just last one to your occupancy guidance, 90% to 92% is about \u2013 the midpoint of that 91% is about in line with where you are today. Is there any major trend in terms of how occupancies likely to migrate throughout the year, is it expected to be roughly flattish?","Ray Ritchey","We have got rollover at the end of the year with Gateway. We have got the rollover at 601. So, my anticipation is that it will go down at the beginning of the year and then it will grow through the years. So, we could be sub-91% at the end of the year, beginning of the year and then kind of grow up closer to 92% through towards the end of the year.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Good morning. First on Innovation Place, it sounds like a lot of future lease up in development potential ahead, which will partially take part in, but could you just walk us through the thought process in handing the reins over and is there any gain on sale there? Thanks.","Owen Thomas","The thought process of the sale was that was the preference of our clients. And in my comments, I mentioned a gain, which I think is $78 million.","Mike LaBelle","Yes, that\u2019s also in our guidance for net income. There is the GAAP gain within the guidance for net income and our guidance that we provided. So, there is a GAAP gain and there is also a tax gain.","Vance Edelson","Okay, perfect. And then it sounds like you have got some good prospects for a permanent solution on the FAO space. Could you give us a feel for the potential NOI upside ballpark when you feel that retail space if it works out the way you want versus the current temporary tenant and versus when FAO was there and could maintaining the buildings image as you mentioned could that weigh on revenues significantly?","Doug Linde","So, I am going to \u2013 this is not going to \u2013 to be very satisfactory, but given that we are talking to specific tenants, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable front-running what we might charge any particular tenant for the space. I can tell you that the contribution from that 65,000 square feet was in and around $20 million prior to the termination of the lease and we plan on significantly surpassing that number. And I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I mean, you are not going to be able to get me to say what significantly is defined as, but you are aware of what other space rents for on Fifth Avenue. And as I said before, our advantage is that we probably have one of the most highly trafficked plazas on the Avenue, particularly with the Apple Store and the demand that it generates the little bit of a challenges that we have at plaza. So, the storefront is not right out on the street, which has its benefits and its disadvantages. And so we have to work through all of that with the various tenants that we are discussing on the space with.","Vance Edelson","Okay, got it. And then just looking at the development pipeline, it\u2019s still largely office, but the two groundbreakings during the quarter were resi where you are getting 6% yields versus say 7.5% on the office side. Should we expect more of the same going forward with new projects more in that lower yield bucket and then what are the other considerations there as you think about the capital deployment?","Doug Linde","Well, I think that if we do more residential projects, I think that we would anticipate that the yields will be in the similar ballpark when we are doing office buildings and we are generally trying to generate cash-on-cash returns in excess of 7% as I described the deals that are coming online in \u201817 for a full contribution will be in excess of 8%. So, I think that, that is our goal and that is what our mission is obviously depending upon the particular site and the particular structure of the lease and who the tenant is, it can be varied.","Vance Edelson","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital. Go ahead. Your line is open.","John Kim","Thank you. Doug, you provided the diversity of tenants actively looking at Salesforce Tower, I was wondering if you could do the same for Embarcadero Centre and if there is any potential to attract tech tenants there?","Doug Linde","So, the Embarcadero Center activity is primarily at the moment in terms of the full floors, asset manager, money manager and law firms. And interestingly, one of the fundamental things that we are discovering is that as much as people like to and want to sort of redo their space, the cost of re-tenanting space is astronomically high and it\u2019s getting higher in these markets both through construction cost increases from inflation as well as the demand of labor. And so the installations that have previously been built have \u2013 in fact have some utilities. And so we have, for example, law firms that are looking at some of that Bingham McCutchen, now Morgan Lewis space and saying we can figure out ways to make use of this space and instead of having spent $140 a square foot when we have to spend $85 or $90 a square foot. On the tech side, we actually are seeing some amount of tech looking at Embarcadero Center and I think honesty largely it\u2019s because there is so little available space now in the south of a market location that tenants are sort of looking for blocks of space wherever they can find it. And we will have some small blocks of space and we continue to be a very viable alternative for those types of users. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to make any additional comments?","Bob Pester","No, I think you pretty much covered what\u2019s happening in Embarcadero Center. We have done a few tech deals here, but nothing of significance. We have had some tech tenants like Microsoft look here that landed elsewhere. And I would agree with Doug as the market gets tighter, we will probably see more of them.","John Kim","In the similar vein, you have WeWork in a couple of your developments, do you see them backfilling any of your near-term expirations?","Doug Linde","I think WeWork is an important user of space in all of our markets and to the extent that it makes sense for their business model and it makes sense for how we are marketing and leasing our space for us to come together. We will consider those opportunities.","John Kim","I had a question on the special dividends I think you mentioned that it would likely get paid. What is the scenario in which it wouldn\u2019t be paid? Are you in any late stage of any acquisitions that you are looking at?","Doug Linde","As we mentioned in prior years, we and the board will make that decision at year end based on our net income. We did provide the gain associated with the sales to try to help you understand what the potential for that could be. I did mention that we don\u2019t contemplate having any additional sales for this year. And I also mentioned that the acquisition environment continued to be challenging, but the final \u2013 any dividend and the amount of any dividend won\u2019t be finalized until later in the year.","John Kim","Okay. And then finally, Owen, maybe can you provide some commentary on Brookfield\u2019s joint venture with the Qatar Investment Authority at Manhattan West this week? Any implications for office pricing or sovereign wealth funds\u2019 appetite for development risk?","Owen Thomas","Well, I think it\u2019s another indication as we were talking about earlier of the interest in both offshore and we also see interest from offshore investors, but I think it\u2019s another example of offshore investors being very interested in high-quality U.S. real estate in core markets. And I think that there is also I think increasingly \u2013 increasing interest on some sovereign wealth part \u2013 some funds part not on all and moving up somewhat in the risk curve and trying to achieve higher return while we are taking the risk and I think this investment like Qatar in that project is an example of it.","John Kim","Did the pricing surprise you at all?","Owen Thomas","Honestly, I don\u2019t know that much about the pricing.","John Kim","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, your line is open.","Brad Burke","Hi, good morning. I was hoping you can give us some coder on how should we think about the magnitude of the podium project at North Station since it sounds like that might be a near-term start and since you will be capitalizing interest in G&A on that and any other projects that come out of the shadow pipeline, I was wondering what the guidance contemplates if anything, in the way of new incremental development for capitalized interested in G&A?","Doug Linde","So the podium project is approximately $285 million. Right now, we are assuming that Delaware North if he started we will go forward with it, so obviously it would be half of that. And we also assume that if we have Delaware North as a partner that we will put some additional third party financing on it. So that\u2019s sort of the magnitude of that. And then next piece would be the residential and hotel sites, which are pretty integral to one-half of the building. And then the last piece of the Office Tower, which is I think is the longest lead item from our perspective because it\u2019s more tenant specific. And I think we will have a better sense of where Delaware North is on those two projects in the next quarter. And as Owen said, when we talk to you in I guess early January or late January we will have more flesh to put on the bone.","Mike LaBelle","We have not included the starts of these. They don\u2019t have a significant impact on our earnings, I mean there could be some additional capitalized interest that is not currently in our model and our guidance for this, if there is whatever dollars are spend out it could improve our interest expense a little bit because our capitalized interests might be a little bit higher, if we were to start that project.","Brad Burke","Okay. And then just an update because you continue to push and development, just what you are seeing at construction costs in the market and how you are thinking right now about the rest of the construction costs maybe take a big step up from where they are at currently?","Owen Thomas","So I think I have said this previously and it will be a consistent message, which is as a little inflation as the Fed is and others are seeing in parts of the consumer economy. Construction market in San Francisco, Boston, Washington, DC and New York is seeing significant inflation defined as right now somewhere around 6% plus per year. And so we are doing everything we can to make deals and do our bidding sooner rather than later and do buyouts on long-term lead items and get our drawings in a position where we can do that thoughtfully as quickly as possible. And we build all of that inflation into the budgets that we provide you. So a budget that for a building that\u2019s going to commence in 2016 or \u201817 will have built in inflationary creep in the hard cost numbers to take care of what we consider to be a reality of the market today.","Brad Burke","Okay. So that 6% or so number is what we should think about you guys underwriting for cost inflation?","Owen Thomas","Yes.","Brad Burke","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, your line is open.","Ian Weissman","Good morning it\u2019s actually Ian Weissman here. Just a couple of questions, as I listen to you comments about San Francisco and a way that also what Kilroy is saying about the continued stringing in that market, I was wondering if you can help us understand as you guys think about leading indicators for demand, what should we be focused on, a lot of times people focus on sub-leased space, but how do you think about lack of IPOs this cycle or growth space or private market valuations?","Owen Thomas","So Ian, my comment to you would be as follows, which is I think the thing that we first look at is we look at the amount of venture capital led investment that\u2019s occurring in the various markets in the country and how that measures vis-\u00e0-vis the last four quarters or five quarters in years and what it sort of looks like historically and because that sort of where a lot of it starts particularly on the tech side. And then we expect that there will be failures that the changes that are occurring in the technology space and the number of entrants into various product categories are not single. And so as an example, in the mobile payment system, there are five or six tech companies that have all either attempted to go public or are moving towards that direction and have aligned themselves with other tech companies.","And in my opinion, they are not all going to be successful, right. So Samsung has their own pay, Apple Pay is out there, PayPal is out there, Visa has a product, Square has a product, they can\u2019t all possibly be on every mobile payment service in every retailer in the country because it\u2019s just too many of them. And so we anticipate that there are going to be failures. And so when we look at things like layoff at Twitter or other blowups, on a one-off basis those are the types of things that don\u2019t worry us. Where we start to see significant layoff due to global economic concerns and major changes in what\u2019s going on from a GDP perspective, that\u2019s where I think we would start to feel really uncomfortable about the demand characteristics of that particular marketplace. And it\u2019s really hard to sort of see with the canary in the coal mine is on that in the current environment.","I would just add to that. Look, I think there are metrics that we can all look at. I think the venture capital investing historically versus rents is certainly an interesting one. But I think we also rely heavily on what just what is our expense on a day-to-day basis in the marketplace. I mean given the portfolio that we have and the insights that we have and what\u2019s going on in the market, we have watched with some wonder over the last couple of weeks, all of the negative press and commentary about the San Francisco market when our actual experience is completely inverse of it as Doug and Bob described.","Ian Weissman","That\u2019s helpful. Just two other questions, as you think about your non-core, I should say asset sales next year, can you maybe help us understand a little bit better or walk us through what some of those low-growth assets are or maybe by market?","Owen Thomas","Look, we will continuously be evaluating our portfolio for assets that would be in non-core areas. Some examples of that that we \u2013 of assets like that, that we have sold over the last few years have been some of our Suburban Boston, outside of the Waltham assets, some of our suburban Maryland assets. We \u2013 to sell, we not only we have to determine if they are non-core, but they also have to be leased at a level and has to be a strong enough capital market where we feel like we are getting an attractive price to exit. So what we are going \u2013 what we did at this year and what we are going continue do in \u201816 is to continue to look at those assets, see what the leasing status is, see what the market conditions are and see if we have an opportunity to sell those assets at an attractive level for shareholders.","Ian Weissman","That\u2019s great. And finally, this might be a tough question to answer as we sit here in 2015, but Owen you said that \u201817 could be a year where we can experience or you guys can experience meaningful growth, can you kind of just put some parameters on that for investors?","Owen Thomas","Well, what we have tried to do following on our last call was to put out a slide in our recent Investor Relation materials and also, Doug and I and Mike spent a fair amount of time trying to describe it today. We are obviously not putting out \u201817 numbers, but what we tried to do is say for these \u2013 for a select group of assets that are again shown in the slide in our IR material, we think that the same-store NOI for those assets. And these are the ones that are \u2013 many of them are experiencing a downdraft and then an updraft. But for those assets, we see an $80 million increase in same property NOI from \u201815 to 2017. And then we also wanted to point out as we have been describing and as you have discussed, we have a very active development pipeline and portfolio. And if you do the math on that, with our projections, we believe that we will add an additional $72 million in annualized NOI from our development portfolio by the end of 2017. So, those are the numbers that we are using now to hopefully give you some feel for what 2017 could look like albeit I recognize it\u2019s an incomplete picture.","Ian Weissman","I appreciate that color. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Great, thank you very much. Just two questions for me. The first one is for Ray Ritchey, now that you guys have bought out Beacon on Fountain Square and consolidated all the Reston Town Center, does this allow you to accelerate some of your redevelopment plans or regardless of whether you owned it in a partnership or not it doesn\u2019t change the timeline with regards to future redevelopment?","Ray Ritchey","Thanks, Alex. The original density of additional development pad in the Town Center per se was acquired where we bought the first space 2.5 years ago. And we have been going the last two years to position that asset for development and it\u2019s really a two-phase asset. The first as we talked about today is the 508 and the 20,000 square feet of commercial space, 508 units of residential, but we are also working on another office tower that will be approximately 270,000 square feet and we are taking steps to put that in position as well. And then of course, we still have the Gateway side, which has the potential of upwards of 3 million to 3.5 million square feet of space in mixed use development that will be forthcoming when Metro comes. So, Reston is great today, it will be even greater in the future.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then heading out West, the innovation and the sale of Broadcom, can you just help us put some parameters around the pricing? With the all-in additional rights, it looks like it\u2019s about $190 a foot. So, if you can just give us some perspective on your thoughts to sell versus keep it and do that development for your own account?","Owen Thomas","As I mentioned earlier, another question came up about that. It was the preference of the client to purchase the site and own the buildings versus us continuing to own the buildings and lease them. So that was the driver.","Doug Linde","So, Alex, first of all, we didn\u2019t say who the tenant is, so those are your words not ours for the record. So, when we think about that site in North San Jose, which is Mountain View in North San Jose and Sunnydale and Santa Clara all are very different types of markets. The net rent that you would achieve today on 1980s vintage building is somewhere around $2 a square foot. And so you can sort of back into what the economics might be on leasing the space recognizing that in order to lease those buildings there needs to be tenant improvements and brokerage commissions on all sort of things. And then, obviously, while we have been able to and very thoughtfully create additional density there. In order to do that, there has to be a change in the configuration of the way the parking is currently operated, i.e., there needs to be structured parking garages. And it\u2019s not a paid parking type of a situation. So, you also have to consider what the costs are of replicating the parking for the existing buildings as you build the additional 500 plus thousand square feet of density and what the cost of that is. So, all of those things factored into the pricing that we think was a strong price, a fair price for both us as the owner and for our potential user.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thanks a lot, Doug.","Doug Linde","And I just want to reiterate what I said earlier is how pleased we are with this transaction given the price, given the vacancy that we will not be experiencing in the company and the new client relationship that we have in the development assignment. So, we think it\u2019s a terrific transaction for the company and for shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning, everyone. I actually thought I had jumped out of queue here. Most of the questions have been answered, but I guess just going back to the free rent conversation, you mentioned a number of leases that are going to have some burn off here in \u201816, but I guess can you just tell us what the dollar amount of free rent is in the third quarter numbers and what that looks like? Because I guess the issue with a straight line rent guidance you provided is that, that would include some additional free rent and straight line rent for new leasing activity, I think. So, just curious what level of free rent is actually coming off in \u201816 that\u2019s in the third quarter numbers?","Mike LaBelle","Well, third quarter numbers for non-cash rents, about $18 million, $19 million. And again, for the full year, it\u2019s $90 million to $95 million. It started off around $30 million in the first quarter and it\u2019s tailed down. I expect the fourth quarter to be kind of comparable to where the third quarter is. And then the 2016 numbers will be significantly lower than that. And it is a combination of some fair value rent going down as well as some straight line rent going down, it\u2019s both of those things. But the big pieces I mentioned we are in the pre-rent piece, the fair value pieces, there is some 767 Fifth and Hancock, where we saw some rollovers occur in \u201815 and also in \u201816 with 767 Fifth, where you are going to see that come off and it\u2019s just going to be greater in \u201815 than in \u201816. Those two buildings are also contributing to it.","Vincent Chao","Alright. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick of Capital One. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Hey, guys. I will be brief, because obviously the call is going on quite a long time, but I am sorry if I missed it earlier, I was cut off we had a fire alarm in the building. But, Ray, this might really be for you. Obviously, you guys have decided to keep multifamily at Reston on balance sheet, but looking out towards the projects site at Gaithersburg, I guess, what drove the decision to sell to Camden and were you looking at any other potential counterparties? I know obviously equity residential just sold a lot of their stuff out in that direction to Starwood, so just wondering what the overall plan and thought process is there?","Ray Ritchey","Well, Tom, on the multifamily, specifically to Reston and wherever multifamily is part of a mixed use development, we tend to hold on to those, because we want to control the environment for our office and retail tenants as well. So, in places like the Back Bay or certainly Reston Town Center and other mixed use projects look to us to continue to own those. Now, the situation in Gaithersburg with Camden is completely different. That\u2019s a greenfield suburban site. We still haven\u2019t developed anything vertically there yet. We sold an adjacent site to lifetime fitness. Just seemed sense to take our profit on the land, sell it and let Camden experience the great joy of going vertical. So, long story short, we are going to keep the stuff that\u2019s integrated into our projects and may continue to sell the stuff that\u2019s one-off and not key to our mixed use development.","Tom Lesnick","I appreciate that insight. And then my last one, just quickly, wondering if you can comment at all on the objection to the TSA award and where that stands?","Ray Ritchey","Well, I guess I will take that one. So, we have competed for the headquarters of TSA and it was awarded to another party. We had a sense that the GSA did not conduct the award as anticipated and we filed a protest. That\u2019s all we can say about it at this point in time. We are awaiting the final resolution and we will see what happens when the judge makes his ruling.","Tom Lesnick","Alright, appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Owen Thomas","Well, that concludes our questions. Thank you very much for your time and attention when we look forward to seeing many of you in NAREIT in a few weeks. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call.

Zuckerman","Good morning all. Thank you for joining us for this discussion about the company and the environment in which it works. I'm going to spend most of my comments just sort of describing the general macroeconomic environment. ","It is still a time, it seems to me, when we have to be very cautious about where the economy is going in general. The unemployment numbers are very weak, the housing prices continue to go down, consumer sales are still weak, inventory buildup is primarily accounting for a good part of the growth that we've had. We face the risk of a situation in which, while there isn't that much in the way of additional layoffs, still that there are some, there's very little hiring going on across the country. ","Nevertheless, within this context, the basic business strategy of Boston Properties still seems to be working out fairly well for the following reasons: Number one, we are in unique markets and the markets that have by and large done relatively well in this weak economy, and those markets are cities. And cities, which have certain characteristics including the level of employment that requires, shall we say, a knowledge base for their flourishing and, indeed, survival. And that is true of the cities that we are in: Cambridge and Boston and New York and Washington and its suburbs and San Francisco. San Francisco was the last city to sort of really get its gear in forward. But in the last year, 1.5 years, particularly as the social media boom spread throughout that community, we have seen a dramatic turnaround in the performance of that city and in the performance of our real estate in that city and in its surrounding areas. ","But in the other cities, we have continued through this entire period to do relatively well. I'm not saying that it is the kind of exuberant experience that we had for many, many years, but still, the basic strategy that the company followed from day 1, which was to be in certain markets that really had the best chance to continue to flourish even in difficult times and to be in those buildings within those markets that would be the ones that would attract tenants. Not that our rents haven't gone down somewhat, but we own, by and large, the kind of buildings that when those companies that are doing well look for a new place of occupancy, they look to our buildings. And so our basic occupancy has held up remarkably well throughout this period, and our basic strategy, it seems to me, continues to hold up remarkably well. ","So the question in this sense is, are these cities going to continue to do well, and in particular, what is the national macroeconomy going to have to say about how well these cities are going to do. We think these cities are going to continue to do reasonably well. But isn't to say that we think, and I certainly don't think, that this economy is going to continue to do very well. It has not been doing well now for quite a few years, and we have been bearish about this economy, as many of you will remember over the years that we've been talking about it, for quite a few years. We're talking 4 or even 5 years. And I do think that this is going to go on for a year or 2, or maybe even more. My own view, it's going to take a minimum of 2 years and probably between 3 to 5 years for us to work through the overhang of debt that now suppresses the economy. It is also going to take us some time to see if after the next election, we can develop national policies that offer a much better chance to restimulate our economy on a macro level than the ones we have had to date. And this is something, no matter who comes into office, they're going to have to really think about it and see whether or not they can fashion such policies and get them passed into legislation. ","At this stage of the game, it really -- when you think that you're in the middle of the kind of political campaign that we have witnessed, it's hard to believe that anybody is going to come out of this campaign with the kind of authority, political authority and moral credibility to move the Congress and to have a Congress that's going to be very responsive to whomever the President is. But we're just going to have to wait and see on that. In any event, I do think that the economy is sort of getting somewhat better and not really getting worse. There is a chance that it will get worse because at some point, everybody is going to get exhausted with the fumes of optimism and really begin to think very differently about the economy. For the moment, that's a little bit away in terms of seeing it because the economy is growing, albeit at a very slow pace. But in our markets, as I say, we find ourselves really dealing by and large with reasonably good markets, not great markets, but reasonably good markets. This shows up both in terms of the level of occupancy and in terms of the rents that we are obtaining. And the real question is, we do have a unique advantage at this stage of the game, which is the cost of capital. The cost of long-term capital for a company like Boston Properties has dropped dramatically. We have never seen anything like that, not in the, I'm embarrassed to say, 50 years that I've been in this business. We've just never seen anything like the kind of rates that we're now able to realize, and this is going to give us an advantage on several grounds. One is we still can do a lot of leasing, in a sense, at somewhat lower rates. But if our financing costs have dropped significantly as they have, our margins will be maintained in one form or another, even sometimes greater than they were before. So that is one thing that will help us mitigate the current condition of the economy which while, as I said, it is not going down, it is still relatively weak in terms of the fiscal and monetary policies that we've had, trying to give it the kind of stimulus so that the economy would begin to self-generate itself at a higher level of growth of GDP. Anyway, that hasn't happened yet, but we think we're reasonably well positioned to continue to grow, to continue to find assets that we can acquire and develop, and to continue in a sense as we turn over the space in some of our buildings, these are buildings that are the highest quality within the markets they are in. They are, as we say, A buildings in A locations. Their replacement cost continues to go up every year and so it mitigates again the downward pressure on the space that we have, and we have kept a fairly high vacancy in virtually every market we are in. ","So that's as much of a summary that seems to me, I should give you at this point. My colleagues will fill you in with a lot of the other aspects of our company's operations, and particularly in the last quarter. ","Thank you all very much.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Happy new year to those of you who I haven't personally seen or talked to. ","We finished 2011 with a total return to shareholders of 18%. We completed about 5 million square feet of leases. We delivered $932 million of developments, which we expect to have all stabilized by the third quarter, with a yield of about 7.4%. And we have another $1.8 billion of active developments, which are going to be delivered between 2014 and 2012. Those include 2 recent developments, which are the Reston Residential and 17 Cambridge Center, which I believe are in the supplemental as of this quarter. ","In addition, as our operating earnings improved, we increased our dividend in the fourth quarter by 10% to an annual rate of $2.20. So it was a really, really good year for Boston Properties. ","As Mort described, our corporate strategy of selecting on select markets, submarkets and buildings with unique and differentiated demand characteristics and limits on new supply, and we support that with a terrific operating platform with an amazing group of associates, has really allowed us to be very successful in spite of I think what Mort would describe as an unpredictable macroeconomic environment. ","So last quarter, we talked about our baseline earnings for 2012, and Mike's going to update that. But I thought I would keep my remarks this quarter contained to the operating fundamentals in our markets and those expectations for 2012. So that's really where I'm going to focus my time. ","In 2011, it was the second time we surpassed 5 million square feet of annual leasing. It was about 1.3 million square feet in the fourth quarter, which was a pretty consistent pace through the year. We had about 85 transactions with an average of 90 over the first 3 quarters. So again, very consistent. Our second-generation rents were really in line with our previous guidance, and that includes the downsize associated with San Francisco. If you strip San Francisco out of our numbers, our mark-to-market second generation was actually up 8.5%. And remember, you're going to see the same trend throughout 2012 in California as we roll over the leases in EC 4, many of which we've already actually commenced the leases -- the leases have been done on. ","Our in place rent at Embarcadero Center 4, which most of the rollover is from, was $63 a square foot as of December 31 of 2010. And it's now -- at the end of this year, it was $54 per square foot. So you get a sense of the roll down that we witnessed. ","As we look forward, our portfolio mark-to-market today is about $1.53. I'm sure everyone noted that our concessions this quarter were significantly higher than traditionally, actually about $30 per square foot, above our run rate in 2011, which actually was probably $10 to $15 lower than what we traditionally have seen. And it was really due to about 1.2 million square feet of new long-term leases versus the renewals that we traditionally do during the quarter. The average length of our leases expanded from 102 months -- to 102 months from 72 months for the prior 3 quarters. ","As Mort said, the job growth of the United States today is clearly focused on businesses that are oriented on new ideas, be they in the technology or life sciences or the medical device industries. And if you look at venture capital as sort of a leading indicator, it was up over 20% in 2011 versus 2010. And surprise, surprise, the Silicon Valley, New England and the New York Metropolitan areas were the top 3 areas for venture investing, with more than 60% of the deal flow. And if you look at the industry focus, it was software, biotech, medical devices, energy and social media. ","So I guess it's not surprising that the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco CBD showed the most significant improvement in real estate fundamentals in 2011. There was 8.6 million square feet of office and R&D absorption in '11 to the fourth quarter, although the pace did in fact slow as we moved into 2012. After this very active year, there still are, in the Silicon Valley, 20 active requirements over 100,000 square feet. ","For our portfolio, we leased another 90,000 square feet, bringing our total leasing to 355,000 square feet down the valley. And rents rose dramatically. ","In May, we did a 50,000 square-foot lease in Mountain View Research, $15 triple net. Two weeks ago, we signed a 25,000 square-foot deal on the same park, $27 triple net. ","Office rents in Mountain View have moved from $27 a square foot triple net in early 2011 to in excess of $42 triple net today. We purchased a building in November, which is described in our press release. The rents that are in place there are about $33 a square foot. It was purchased at a projected 2012 GAAP yield of 7.5% and a cash yield of 6.3%. There is specular development underway once again down the valley in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, and the momentum does in fact show that it's pushing forward, coming to the North Peninsula, which is where our Gateway projects are. We have 4 floors of space that we got back at the end of the year. We've re-leased one of them already and are in negotiations on the second. Rents in south San Francisco are at about $20 per square foot, triple net. Again, very different than what we saw in Mountain View and Palo Alto. But to just give you a perspective that it's not great everywhere, across the highway from our Gateway project is a 320,000 square-foot, brand-new building completed 3 years ago, it's yet to sign its first lease. ","Our view is that rents are going to continue to rise in 2012, dramatically in the South, not so quickly in the North, but they will be rising as we look forward. ","Growing demand from the technology sector has also been a very significant factor in the net absorption of about 2 million square feet in the city of San Francisco. Class A vacancy has dropped over 400 basis points, which is a dramatic number, in 2011 to somewhere around 10.5%. There's been a lot of focus on the desirability of the non-core office space in some markets like the multimedia gulfs [ph] and the China Basin market for these technology companies, but those same tech companies are also interested in traditional highrise office space. ","In the last 60 days, Medivation, which is a biotech company investing [ph] in the journal today about prostate cancer drugs, leased the 34th and the 35th floors in 5 25 [ph] market, so that's 55,000 square feet. Linkedin took 3 floors in One Montgomery Tower, that was a space that was formerly occupied by Charles Schwab, and SalesForce has leased 400,000 square feet at 50 Fremont and they did it on a long-term basis for over 17 years. And the space they took back filled [ph] the space that Pillsbury Winthrop is leaving to move into our building at Embarcadero Center 4, and space that Ernst & Young once occupied before they moved to 555 Mission. ","These are all traditional office towers. Embarcadero Center, we did 300,000 square feet of leasing, 6 full are multi-floor deals, including a full floor to a cloud computing company, bringing our total year-to-year leasing to 615,000 square feet. ","Our asking rents at EC are in the low 40s on the small or non-used spaces, in the ECs 1, 2 and 3, to over $7 a square foot at the top of EC floor. Rents are about 15% higher than they were last time this year.","Activity in Cambridge is what's leading the Boston region, as Mort suggested. There's over 1 million square feet of new construction, which is 100% committed to biotech and life science companies. One office building at Technology Square is actually being converted to a lab space. It's actually reducing the overall inventory in Cambridge and putting more pressure on office rents. We are in discussions with tenants for almost all of our availability at Cambridge Center. And asking rents are up 10% to 15% from 2011 to over $50 a square foot. The surge of larger technology and biotech companies for space in Cambridge is continuing, and there are new entrants for the market everyday. As an example, Amazon.com, who doesn't have a presence in the Boston market, is now looking for 30,000 to 40,000 square feet in Cambridge as we speak. ","Across the river in the Back Bay, which is where we sit, there's really limited short-term availability, but it's not preventing us from doing leasing on a forward basis. ","At the Hancock Tower, we are in discussions with tenants, many of whom are subtenants of Manulife, on long-term extensions and expansions beginning in '13, '14 and '15. We've actually completed 100,000 square-foot of forward leases and we're in negotiations with tenants that occupy an additional 164,000 square feet on 6 floors. These transactions aren't going to impact our numbers until the original leases expire in '13 or '14, but we are creating strong, and I promise you, very strong contractual revenue growth. Rents in our Back Bay properties range from the low 40s to over $70 a square foot at the top of the Hancock tower. We completed one additional floor at the base of our Atlantic Wharf tower. This last quarter, where rents are in the low 50s, when you think about our Back Bay portfolio, keep an eye on 2014 and 2015 because that's when most of our major lease expirations occur. But we are actively working today, as I said, on new or replacement tenants for that space. ","We continue to see evidence of modest growth from small and mid-sized Boston financial tenants as a number of the Hancock deals involve expansion. But at the same time, there are large traditional users in the city that are becoming more efficient in their space utilization and that's leading the contractions. ","As an example, one major Boston financial institution, which occupies about 1.1 million square feet, including space at the Hancock Tower and other buildings in the Back Bay, is expected to either renew or relocate into only 800,000 square feet without any job reductions. This type of a factor is really impacting the net absorption of the city, so there really hasn't been much in the way of marginal improvement in the overall demand characteristic on a vacancy perspective. And we continue to have lots of space at the base of buildings that the city is dealing with. ","The suburban market had pretty good activity in 2011, but again, absorption was tempered through sublet availabilities brought about by corporate mergers and acquisitions. We completed half a dozen leases over 25,000 square feet that involved either relocation or expansion for tenants looking for more space in 2012. But companies like IBM and Oracle continue to purchase local tech companies and they consolidated operations. And while Biogen's decision to move into our building in Cambridge from Weston was a great opportunity for us, as a new development, it hasn't helped the overall dynamics of the 128 [Route 128] market. We're about 90 days away from completing the first phase of our Bay Colony repositioning and we finally completed a lease with a new technology company, 40,000 square feet, and they're already looking for new additional space. ","During the fourth quarter, we completed almost 200,000 square feet of leasing and we have pretty good visibility on leases for a similar amount of activity during the first quarter of 2012. ","Availability is still in the mid teens, however, which means that in our view, rents are maybe [ph] pretty flat year-to-year after a pretty significant growth in 2011. Rents were up about 15% last year.","In D.C., the impacts of the deficit negotiations and the spending reductions and the President election are going to mute any significant improvement in overall market conditions. In the district, we really don't see the government expanding in 2012. ","The GSA procurement process has become more prolonged, and it's interesting, as we witnessed for many years in our other properties, our lease expiration really isn't an issue for the GSA. They simply continue to pay at their old rent and they let the leases expire. They don't really have any motivation to do anything. ","Over the last few quarters, additional large blocks of space have come on to the market due to law firm consolidation, and that's increased the choices for tenants. So in the short term, we think private sector leasing is going to continue to be slow and there really isn't much in the way of large law firm lease expirations before 2014 that are going to drive much in the way of large leasing in the city. However, the good news for us, again, is that our portfolio is 97% leased. We have 160,000 square feet of expiring in uncovered 2012 exposure. So while we may not see much in the way of lease economic improvements, we also don't think that we're going to be impacted over the short or the medium-term. Market rents for the best space are in the high 40s and may touch $50 on a triple net basis. But the bulk of the leasing in the city that we see happening in 2012 is going to really be in the high 30s to about mid-40s triple net, with little expectation from much in the way of change. Just to give you a perspective, the GSA perspective cap for large leases for 2012 is $49 gross, which really limits the activity from the GSA to the older buildings in secondary locations. Operating expenses, bottom line, are somewhere between $17 and $20 a square foot for those buildings, so you're talking somewhere in the high 20s, low 30s for where those rents are going to be on a triple net basis. ","Government contractors are also delaying their leasing decisions. We're completing short term extensions because contracts just are -- they're very much in the air. There's going to be a $500 billion to $1 trillion of defense spending reductions that are going to kick in over the next 10 years and it's clearly going to have an impact on the overall region. ","If you look at the Dallas Corridor, depending on how you slice it, availability is in excess of 20%. Yet when you look at our portfolio in Reston, vacancy is 1% and we have completed over 300,000 square feet of additional leases in Reston in the fourth quarter, including 190,000 square-foot lease with Bechtel that absorbed 100% of the availability that we had in our Reston Overlook project. ","During the year, we leased 600,000 square feet in Reston with virtually no renewals. Many of you attended our investor conference and you saw our presentation materials on Reston Town Center. We have created a unique environment for users of office space in Northern Virginia and our users have appreciated the value proposition, and that's translated into significant rental rate premiums over the market. In the midst of a really, really weak Northern Virginia market, there is still demand for premium product. So space in the town center is being leased in the mid to high 40s on a gross basis depending upon concession packages, where space outside the core are leasing in the high 30s and space outside the town center is being leased in the high 20s to the low 30s with significant concessions. ","Our one large exposure in Reston is a 182,000 square-foot building, which is adjacent to the new DIA headquarters, the first building of which is going to be delivered in February. We're aware of interest from another agency that can -- is very interested in the infrastructure that's in that building. It's a 7 year-old BRAC compliant building, but the timing of the solicitation is being impacted by the budgetary issues that I talked about a few minutes ago, so we'll see when that lease ultimately gets allowed to be -- to move forward, but we're optimistic that it's going to come to that building. ","One area that the government continues to fund is the area of cyber security, and the nucleus of that is up at Fort Meade. We are quickly finishing our second building at Annapolis Junction, just outside that base, and we have very strong leasing activity for that product. ","As we discussed last quarter, the limited activity in our New York City operating portfolio stems from a lack of availability. We're somewhere between 97% and 90% leased. And our decision last quarter was to start doing prebuilds in 510 Madison. I would note that we did do one 50,000 square-foot expansion at 125 West 55th Street, but our prebuild suites are close to being done. So again, we have 7 of those at 510 Madison, 5 at 601 Lex [Lexington Avenue], 4 at 599 Lex and 2 at 540 Madison. Tenant interest on those spaces is good, but again, the deal size is going to be smaller than our typical deals and tenants want to see the finished product. We have leases in negotiation on 3 suites that are done at 599 and 2 suites at 510, where construction should be completed in the next couple of weeks. In addition, we actually picked up 2 additional floors of space at 510 Madison where we're working on leases right now. ","Our big exposure in 2012 is going to be at 399 Park, where we're going to have availability beginning in the third quarter. That space is being priced at around $90 a square foot, and we've just started to market that space to full floor and multi-floor users. And I'm not going to be surprised if we don't decide to do some breaking up there and do some prebuilds as well. We don't expect to have rent commitments for that space until sometime in 2013. ","At the upper end of the market, just to give you a perspective of why we're doing what we're doing, in 2008, there were 105 leases signed at over $100 [ph] a square foot. That dropped to 19 in 2009 and 2010, and it moved up to 44 in 2011. The average high end yield was under 20,000 square feet, which really reinforces our strategy of delivering small prebuilt places to attract those types of tenants. We also do sense that the changes that are occurring at the large financial institutions are starting to lead to the growth and formation of lots of new boutique firms, smaller firms, which we think are going to be excellent candidates for this type of space. ","Today, when you look at 100,000 square foot blocks of space in Midtown and you compare it to last year, there's significantly fewer number. And it's interesting because there's a sort of a barbel-ing of them. There's an abundance of lower space options in older buildings east of Lexington Avenue, where rents are in the 60s or below, and then there's a group of blocks that are above $90 a square foot. Well, the lower levels of 250 West 55th Street is being priced in the mid-80s, and we believe it is an excellent alternative in the market. We continue to have discussions with larger tenants with lease expirations in 2014 and 2015 for the space at 250 West 55th. Users do feel less pressure to make decisions and transactions are taking a longer time to complete, but they are occurring. So that's my summary of the current operating environment. I'll let Mike talk about earnings, and then we will open things up for questions.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into our earnings for the quarter, I want to mention what we completed in the capital markets. ","In early November, we issued $850 million of senior unsecured bonds for a 7-year term at a yield of 3.85%. The 7-year term fit nicely into our maturity schedule and the deal represents the lowest coupon we have ever issued in the bond market. This capital is dilutive to our earnings in the short term until we repay other debt maturities. ","Last quarter, we bought back $50 million of our 2012 exchangeable notes. We paid off $50 million of mortgage on our Reservoir Place project in suburban Boston, then we extinguished our Atlantic Wharf construction loan. ","For the rest of 2012, we have about $810 million of debt expiring, with higher GAAP interest rates than the new bonds. ","As we stated in our press release, we'll be redeeming the remaining $576 million of our exchangeable notes in February that have a GAAP rate of 5.63% and a cash coupon of 2 7\/8. We also expect to repay $144 million mortgage on Bay Colony with a 6.53% interest rate and a $65 million loan on One Freedom Square that has a 7.75% interest rate. ","Also, as we noted in our press release, despite substantial efforts to work out a resolution for our Montvale Center property, we expect to transfer the property during the first quarter to the lender, a servicer for a CMBS trust, extinguishing a $25 million loan that is accruing interest at 9.9%. The property's annual FFO is negative $1.2 million and the transfer will result in a gain of approximately $18 million. This is reflected in our first quarter and full-year 2012 net income guidance but is excluded from FFO. ","Upon completion of all of this refinancing, our annual interest expense will have been reduced by approximately $15.6 million or $0.09 per share. In addition, we will still retain just over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which is sufficient to fund all remaining cost for our development pipeline, as well as provide capital for new investment opportunities. ","The health of the capital markets has improved over the last 2 months and particularly since the first of the year as positive domestic economic data and high levels of investor liquidity are resulting in a more bullish sentiment from credit investors. Our outstanding 10-year bonds are trading at spreads in the 170s and we can likely issue new 10-year paper today under 4%. ","In the past 4 weeks alone, our bonds have traded in by 40 basis points. This compares to the 10-year mortgage market where we see the life insurance companies looking for minimum coupons in the low- to mid-4% range for large loans. The CMBS market has wider credit spreads and is not currently competitive for loans on properties like ours, where the life companies aggressively compete. ","We're also seeing continued demand in the bank market, primarily for 5 years or shorter terms with attractive floating interest rates on term or construction facilities. This quarter, we closed 2 construction loans, aggregating $126 million, with LIBOR spreads in the high 100 and a nonrecourse 3-year term loan for one of our valued properties in the mid 200s. ","Now I want to turn to our earnings results. We announced fourth quarter funds from operations of $1.21 per share. This is $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance, and it would've been $0.04 per share above the midpoint if not for the dilution from our bond offering that was not included in our guidance. ","For the full year 2011, we reported funds from operations of $4.84 per share. If you exclude the loss from extinguishment of debt we incurred in 2010, we improved our FFO year-over-year by $0.44 per share or 10%. ","For the quarter, our portfolio generated approximately $5.5 million more than our projections, including $2.5 million of higher rental revenues. Much of the rental revenue came from outperformance in San Francisco, where we signed 340,000 square feet of leases, several of which commenced rental income in the quarter, and we also generated $500,000 of unbudgeted income from a little over 1 month of ownership of 2440 West El Camino Real, our acquisition in Mountain View. ","Other areas where the portfolio performed better than our expectations include parking revenue that was $500,000 above budget, and net operating expenses, which came in $1.3 million under budget. ","In addition, we generated $1.2 million of termination income that we had not budgeted. The 2 largest terminations related to a 30,000 square foot deal at 230 CityPoint in suburban Boston and 25,000 square feet at One Freedom Square in Reston. In both of these instances, we took back space from a vacating tenant prior to their lease expiration and immediately released the space to an expanding tenant in our portfolio. ","Our development and management services income came in $1.3 million above our budget, with virtually all coming from higher-than-normal service in overtime HVAC income from our Boston and New York City regions, and we also generated a sizable leasing commission with the completion of a 50,000 square-foot expansion by a tenant in our 125 West 55th Street joint venture property in New York City. ","The contribution from our joint venture portfolio was about $1 million better-than-expected. The majority came from higher than anticipated percentage rent received from the Apple Store at the GM building as their sales have outperformed their budget. And similar to the wholly-owned portfolio, we also experienced better-than-expected service fee income in the JV portfolio. ","Our hotel continued to show strong improvement with a 7% increase in RevPAR from 2010. For the quarter, it performed slightly above our projections. ","Offsetting the performance of the portfolio is the dilution associated with our $850 million bond deal we closed in early November. We had not projected this financing to occur until mid-February of 2012, and it added $4.3 million to our interest expense for the quarter. Our capitalized interest came in better than we expected so in total, our interest expense was approximately $3.8 million higher than we anticipated. ","We incurred $1.5 million of unbudgeted losses from early extinguishment of debt as well. This related to the acceleration of amortization of finance charges for our Reservoir Place mortgage and our Atlanta Wharf construction loan that we extinguished. In addition, we repurchased $50 million of our exchangeable notes at close to par that also contributed to the charge. ","As we discussed last quarter, we closed on the sale of Two Grand Central Tower in New York City for $401 million in late October. We booked a gain on the sale of $46.6 million, which shows up in our income from unconsolidated joint ventures. We back this out when we calculate our FFO as we exclude all gains on sale from our funds from operations. ","Our FAD for the quarter was lower than typical due to the unusually high second-generation leasing cost that Doug discussed, and the fact that 60% of our recurring capital expenditures occurred in the fourth quarter. Our FAD was still more than sufficient to cover our increased dividend with a payout ratio of 88%. And our FAD for the full year 2011 provided strong coverage of our dividend with a payout ratio of 62%. ","Before I go into our 2012 projections, I just want to remind you of our discussion last quarter on the transition period that a portion of the portfolio will experience in 2012 and its impact on our earnings projections. This includes $25 million of lost income from the downtime associated with redeveloping Patriots Park in Reston, the downtime and roll down of our now expired space at 4 Embarcadero Center and Gateway Center of $12 million, and the 145,000 square feet being vacated midyear by Lumber Hale [ph] at the top of 399 Park Avenue where we project downtime to cost $6 million in 2012. ","As we anticipated, our occupancy ended the quarter at just over 91%, with a reasonable 2012 rollover that we have of 2.4 million square feet, which is 6% of the portfolio. We expect to gain occupancy during the year in average between 91% and 93%. ","Our same-store projections reflect the portfolio transition. We project our same-store NOI to be down 1% to 2% on a cash basis, and down 1.5% to 3% on a GAAP business. This is improved from our view last quarter. We have executed a number of leases at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, as well as a major lease with Bechtel and an expansion by another tenant in Reston, giving us better visibility on the absorption of some of our available space. ","Our acquisition of 2440 West El Camino Real in Mountain View will contribute to our earnings with a projected NOI of $5.4 million in 2012. ","Our development projects are showing consistent leasing progress in line with our projections. We signed additional leases at Atlantic Wharf and are now 93% leased, while at 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, we're 94% leased, demonstrating the strong success of both of these projects. ","The residential components of these developments are also leasing well with The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf at 91% leased and the Residences on the Avenue at 78% leased, each at rents that are among the highest attained in their markets. ","At 510 Madison Avenue, we executed only one lease in the quarter and are 42% leased. But as Doug noted, we're in lease negotiations with multiple tenants for both full floors and for some of our smaller prebuilt suites. So activity is good. ","In the first quarter of 2012, we will deliver the first building at Patriots Park, which is 100% leased to the Defense Intelligence Agency, and later in the year, our 120,000 square-foot Annapolis Junction joint venture development, where we're seeing increased activity. For 2012, we expect these developments to contribute $65 million to $70 million of GAAP NOI, which is in line with our expectations from last quarter.","We expect that our straight-line rents for the consolidated portfolio, including our developments, will total $67 million to $72 million for 2012. This is higher than last quarter, reflecting quicker absorption of space, primarily in San Francisco and in Reston Town Center, combined with our Mountain View acquisition. We're projecting our hotel to contribute $8.5 million to $9.5 million of NOI to 2012, which is approximately 9% above 2011. We recently opened a new restaurant in the hotel and are also in the process of completing significant common area upgrades in the plaza areas of Cambridge Center, both of which we expect will positively impact the hotel performance. ","Due to seasonality, the hotel is projected to run at breakeven NOI in the first quarter. ","Our joint venture portfolio is improving on a cash basis as we roll leases to market rents. And we anticipate a same-store cash NOI growth of 5% to 7% in 2012. ","This quarter's leasing statistics demonstrate that our second-generation leasing in New York City was up 16% on a net basis, part of which was from the transaction in the GM building. ","On a GAAP basis, the roll off of $16 million of noncash fair value rental income resulted in our joint venture FFO contribution declining year-over-year. In 2012, we're projecting FFO contribution from this portfolio of $122 million to $127 million, which includes $54 million of fair value lease revenue and $7 million to 12 million of straight-line rents. ","Our 2012 projection for development and management services income is $25 million to $30 million and is unchanged from last quarter. ","For our G&A expenses, we project between $83 million and $85 million for 2012. We announced the second of a series of annual outperformance plans in our press release. The plan was disclosed in our proxy statement last year and is included in our G&A guidance. ","Our interest expense will be higher than our previous projections in the first quarter of 2012 due to our November bond offering. We're earning only nominal interest income on this cash while we wait to redeem our exchangeable notes in February and prepay $210 million of mortgage debt at the end of the first quarter, which are the first dates that these loans are open for prepayment without penalty. Upon completing these payoffs, our interest expense will be lower for the remainder of 2012. ","For the full year, we expect our net interest expense to be $390 million to $395 million, capitalized interest for the year is projected at $40 million to $45 million and in the first quarter, our net interest expense is projected at $101 million to $103 million.","So if you combine all of these assumptions, it resulted in our projection for 2012 funds from operations of $4.65 to $4.78 per share. The increase in our guidance from last quarter is the result of the contribution of our acquisition in Mountain View, quicker than projected absorption of a portion of our rent available space, a modest increase in the contribution of our joint ventures, offset by higher interest expense from our bond offering. We have assumed no new acquisitions or other new investment activity in our projections. ","For the first quarter, we project funds from operations of $1.12 to $1.14 per share. The first quarter is projected to be down from the fourth quarter of 2011 due to the seasonality of our hotel, as well as a decline in our portfolio NOI from our fourth quarter rollover, the removal from service of the second building at Patriots Park and $2 million of noncash fair value lease revenue burn off in our joint ventures.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Thanks very much. This is Mort Zuckerman again. I'm going to have to excuse myself. I have to attend a funeral service for the former mayor of Boston, and I hope I'll be able to catch up with you on the next call. Thanks very much.","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. Operator, you can open up the queue again. So I apologize that Mort can't be here for the Q&A. But the former mayor of Boston passed away on Friday and the funeral starts at 11:00, and the good news is in terms of Mort's attendance here, is that the funeral is literally down the street so he was able to stay as long as he could. But we will endeavor to answer all of the questions that you ask of us. Hopefully, you won't be asking me political questions because I'm going to refrain from answering those. Go ahead, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess the first question, we did not -- and I'm here with Jaime, we did not hear any details on your acquisition from the quarter on 2440 West El Camino Real. Could you just discuss that acquisition please?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. So I did -- I think I did mention that. It's 7.5% on GAAP yield and a 6.3% cash yield. The building is fully leased. I also said that the market rents were $33.25 in a market where rents currently are about $42 a square foot. So I didn't -- I don't think I -- I want to make sure that you did hear that. It's a good solid Mountain View building. We view Mountain View Palo Alto as the premier area for office ownership in the Silicon Valley. This is a multi-tenanted building that is likely to have users of between 5,000 and 100,000 square feet, no real lease rollover until 2014 and beyond. It's just at an excellent intersection, it's pretty close to Caltrain. It's got retail and high-end housing around it, and we just -- we thought it was a -- it allowed us a good entry point into a market that we feel pretty good about the long-term prospects of.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Doug, did you say how you sourced the deal?","Douglas T. Linde","The deal was out in the brokerage realm. I would say we had a pretty unique way of acquiring it. We -- from the time that we entered our contract period in terms of negotiating a PNF to closing with 7 days.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I just have one more question before I pass it on to Jamie. I think in the introductory comments, Mort was talking about some of the -- that you're in reasonably good markets. I guess, of the markets you're in, which 1 or 2 are you most concerned about?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, this is one of those trick questions, right? So you're asking me to tell you what I like least. But I like everything. So I'll just start that way. I would say in the short term, I'm glad I don't have a lot of availability in Washington D.C. and I'm glad they don't have commodity product in Washington D.C. Because I think that, that's probably in our portfolio, where the weakest amount of demand will come from. I think after that, everybody has, I think, recognized that the financial services sector in New York City is not in a mode of growth at the moment. And so it is putting some degree of pressure on the question of where our tenants are going to be coming from. We again are fortunate to have a unique product availability and we are marketing it towards what we think is a relatively attractive demand generator in the form of smaller financial institutions, a.k.a. hedge funds and money managers and small law firms and small business services companies that are not larger users of premium space. But clearly at 2012, I think, as I've said in my comments, it's going to be a pretty flat year in Midtown Manhattan and likely in other parts of Manhattan given what's going on in the financial services side.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then if I could -- this is Jamie. If I could just ask a quick question for Mike. Based on your higher guidance and the higher CapEx spend in the fourth quarter, what's your outlook for AFFO for 2012?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, if you look at -- let me just kind of go through the pieces a little bit. The -- our projection for occupancy is 91% to 93%, so we expect it to improve through the year. Our rollover is about 2.5 million square feet, so I mean we expect that we're going to do somewhere between 3 million to 3.5 million square feet of leasing next year. So if you look at transaction costs on average, I would expect that it would cost us $120 million to $140 million. If you assume kind of $35 to $40 per square foot, which I think is what we kind of traditionally or typically average, which just actually lines up pretty well with what Doug mentioned where he felt that our average was as well. The CapEx side, we've got -- I would expect our recurring CapEx to be $30 million to $35 million. Now we do have what we call nonrecurring CapEx, which is the money that we're spending at Bay Colony and money that we're going to be spending at the Hancock Tower, primarily on the garage that is adjacent to the Hancock Tower. And we expect that we're going to spend somewhere between $20 million and $22 million on those 2 projects next year. But those were kind of underwritten in our acquisition, that's why we separate them. The straight-line noncash rent I mentioned was $67 million to $72 million, and $60 million to $65 million in the JV portfolio. And then offsetting that, we have noncash interest expense and noncash compensation that is somewhere between $50 million and $60 million and some noncash ground rent. So you kind of add up all those adjustments and you get somewhere between $210 million to $240 million off of our FFO, somewhere in that range, would be where we would call our FAD.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Fent [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just wanted to follow up on New York. Doug, you obviously went through sort of the market commentary a little bit, I was trying to keep up. But I'm just kind of curious, I know you said big blocks are down year-over-year, but what are your expectations sort of given what's going on in the financial services sector and what seems to be happening with the rest of tenant demand, meaning some going downtown, some going to Hudson Square? What's sort of your expectation for market rents now? And I know you had discussed in the past couple of quarters that you saw a little bit of a slowing, but I'm just curious what you've seen in the last 90 days.","Douglas T. Linde","What we've seen in the last 90 days has really been a continuation of what we saw through the larger portion of the year, starting in July when things, I think, started to slow down from a velocity perspective, which is the high-end deals in the premier buildings are still achieving in excess of $100 per square foot. And there is -- as I think I tried to illustrate, the demand isn't anywhere where it once was call it back in 2007, 2008, but it increased significantly since -- from where it was in 2010 and 2009. That being said, there are not a lot of high-paying big block users currently in the market today. So as we think about what our pricing is for 250 West 55th Street, we priced it accordingly. We priced it in the 80s because we think that's the price point for new constructions that is very attractive to the tenants who are interested in continuing to locate in Midtown Manhattan and are not interested in being in a secondary location or secondary building, prewar or east of Lexington Avenue. So we think that's a pretty good pricing point and it's really a question of lease expirations. There's not a lot of incremental growth from large institutions. I've been talking for 2 years about what's been going on in the law firm economy with the reduction in the overall footprint of the legal industry firm-by-firm, but they're all -- there happens to be consolidation that's also going on, which is increasing the size of certain firms and other firms are just no longer doing very well. So we continue to have a tenant in the market list, the tenant list as we call it, that's not insignificant for blocks of space in excess of 100,000 square feet at 255 West 55th Street. It's just these tenants are taking their time making decisions, but they do have lease expirations, and so they're going to act. It's just a question of how quickly they act. So that's where we think rents are. I think that they're trying to get $100 a square foot on a block of space, a big block of space on Park Avenue in the first or second quarter of 2012, given where the economy is and where financial services employment is. It's not going to be an easy thing to do, when quite frankly, we're not pricing big blocks of space that way. That's why, in fact, we're going into the prebuilt market to get some velocity in and be able to achieve what we think are a fair rent for the type of product and location we have.","Unknown Analyst","Do you think net effect of market rents are up, flat or down in New York from here by the end of the year?","Douglas T. Linde","I think they're flat.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Separately, on the investment market, can you talk a little bit about maybe opportunities you're seeing? Has the pipeline started to build a little bit? Obviously, you got this deal done in Mountain View, which looks like an opportunity. Anything else behind it you could speak to?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. So we had a -- I obviously, purposely spent my comment on operations, but any operating platform issues, I expected the question. I would say where we are today versus where we are 3 or 6 months ago, the pipeline is more significant largely because there's a lot more better product that we are looking at today than what we were looking at in the second and the third quarters of 2011. We knew there were some better stuff that was going to hit the market, it has hit the market. Some of it is off market or transactions where there were a relatively few bidders or people being talked to about the acquisitions and there are others that are going to be these fully auctioned, broker-type solicitations that some of the properties are the ones that we might be interested in. So -- and I would articulate that by saying they are in all of the markets we're in. So there is stuff in the CBD of San Francisco, there is stuff in the CBD of Boston, there is stuff in Washington D.C. and then there is stuff in New York City that we are looking at on a pretty continual basis today. And we continue to explore other places, and we are endeavoring to put ourselves in a position where the pricing makes sense and the opportunity is there. We have the capital and the opportunity to close in a very efficient manner and use that as a quiver in our -- an arrow in the quiver.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ross Nussbaum.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm here with Dave Hilmo [ph]. I want to follow up on Jordan's question and specifically about the investment market, Doug. Do you think that following what the Fed said last week, do you think that there's any probability here that the market takes the bait, if you will, and drives cap rates lower in response to a view that interest rates may be anchored here for a couple of years?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that the overall interest rate environment is clearly impacting people's perspectives on what their return expectations are. I would endeavor to say that it is highly unlikely that a high-quality premier office building is going to be trading at anything above a 7-ish type of an IRR on a long-term basis, assuming a moderate view on where rental rate growth might be. If you want to pretend that there are going to be spikes or that there's going to be significant inflation in rates at some point in time, you can drive those numbers much higher. But my sense is -- and that has clearly been affected by interest rates and the view that people are saying, look, I can -- and you see it. People can borrow money on a 5-year basis if they choose to at somewhere between 3.25% and 3.5%. And you can get a very satisfactory yield on a private basis for that, and there's a lot of capital that's prepared to step into that particular type of a transaction and sort of hold on for what the long-term might be in terms of interest rates. There's also, I think, clearly this sense that there is no yield available in very many types of investments, and it is clearly driving people to real estate asset, particularly the types of buildings that we own and the type of buildings that we would like to own, which is impacting pricing again. I can't tell you if I think the overall cap rate is going to be going down much more than it already is, because if you look at the deals that have been done in the better markets, if you have available space in those buildings, people are bidding those assets at below 5% going in cash on cash return. If the buildings are stable and there is not much in the way of lease expiration, the sort of going in returns in our estimation are somewhere in the mid 5 to the low 6s. And depending upon where those market rents are, that may -- the lower the market rents are versus what's in place, the better the yield is going to be and vice versa. So I have a sense of where that sort of where things are. And the fuel that the Fed has put on the fire in terms of saying that they think where interest rates are going to be lower for a longer period of time, I think, is just adding to people's appetite.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Are you targeting 7% unlevered IRRs or do you expect to be doing better than that?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that our expectation on a long-term basis is higher than that. We are looking for assets where we might be able to do something that is sort of not \"underwritten in the asset\" from a cash flow perspective because of our portfolio and because of our experience, where we can share in [ph] buildings and do things that you have to sort of take a little bit of leap and faith in that will get us to returns that are significantly higher than 7%. But if you said to me, what is sort of our typical pricing view of where buildings are, if we're assuming very little in the way of rental rate growth and very little in the way of appreciation, that's where the numbers are. I think that we have other ways of sort of skinning the cat in terms of our underwriting and where we can create value in the assets that allow us to convince ourselves with some degree of accuracy that we can do better than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, you mentioned a firm downsizing in the Back Bay, I think, by roughly 30%, but obviously, keeping jobs about the same. Can you give us some sense of what sort of activity? You mentioned some of the forward leasing you're doing and the strong rent growth. Can you give us some sense of perhaps that growth that you're seeing in rents there?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, it's -- the growth in rents is really because of the product that we have, Jay. So as an example, the average rent in, at the Hancock Tower on the highrise floors is in the mid-50s, and we're going to end up doing deals in the high-60s to low 70s. That's where the renewals are going to get end up being done in our prediction, so that's pretty strong embedded growth. The growth from a tenant demand perspective is coming from those smaller financial institutions. So there's an asset management company, for example, at the Hancock Tower that's currently in 45,000 square feet and is looking for 90,000 square feet. There's another one that's in 30,000 square feet that's looking for another 15,000 square feet. It's those types of -- that's where the sort of the incremental growth is on the demand side.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on average, what sort of terms are you seeing for those transactions?","Douglas T. Linde","We're doing -- lease length terms or market terms?","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Lease length terms.","Douglas T. Linde","So it's generally, the leases that we're doing there are forward 7 to 8 years after 2013 to 2015.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just switching gears...","Bryan J. Koop","Jay, this is Bryan. The other thing that's been the benefit of Back Bay is, of course, in the supply side. If you take that look from year-to-date last year where the vacancy, direct vacancy for the cult of pure class that we focus on, 30-some buildings, it's dropped from 7% to 3%. So that's been a big benefit as well.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on Silicon Valley, Doug, you mentioned some risk of supply. I guess how quickly could you see this ramp up?","Douglas T. Linde","So there is new construction as we speak. There's probably 1 million square feet block of buildings that are on the docket. So there's probably, I'd say, half of that is pure spec and half of that has got tenant commitment. And the buildings that are going up are generally 3 to 6 stories, suburban office buildings that probably have a total development period of between 12 and 15 months.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just on 399 Park, can you get -- you mentioned the rent of $90 a foot. What's your expectation there and I guess which floors as well in 2013?","Douglas T. Linde","There's 140,000 square foot of block. It's in the mid to highrise of the building in the 20s, I believe. And we're hoping that we're going to be able to achieve rents in or around $90 a square foot in the 90s depending upon the size of the block and the amount of capital we put in. If we're doing prebuilts, I think we'll try and get more. And if we're doing multi-floor deals with traditional concession package, which today is probably 9 to 12 months of free rent and $60 a square foot for a 10-year to 15-year commitment, we'll be in the low 90s. That's my expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Josh Attie with Michael. Doug, you gave some really good color on rents for large blocks of space in New York. Can you also talk about the lease economics at some of the smaller prebuilt spaces, including 510 Madison, maybe how has that changed, if at all, relative to your initial underwriting and also relative to the first half of 2011?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, it's -- I'm going to bait myself. Our initial underwriting, we are underwriting rents at the top of building in the high 90s, low $100 a square foot, and at the base of the building, in the high 70s to low 80s. And we are asking for 125 plus or minus at the top of the building. And we are achieving rents that are in the low 90s at the base of the building on both our prebuilt suite as well as our \"floor -- made by floor\" deals, where we're providing a tenant allowance. And I think those are very consistent with what we were pricing to the space at last year in the second, third and fourth quarters.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And can you also give us an update on the 601 Mass redevelopment? I know you have some time before NPR moves out, but were you in the process of finding a tenant for that project?","Douglas T. Linde","Mr. Ritchey?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, NPR doesn't move out until the first quarter of 2013, but construction's going on very well and we have got 3 different proposals out, 2 major law firms and another entity for anywhere between half the building to about 3 quarters of the space. One would be occupancy immediately upon completion in '15, the others go around end of '16. But when you look around D.C., while the existing portfolio may be on the soft side, the availability of sites to build first class buildings is very limited, and we feel really great about the 601 Mass site.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A few very quick questions. First up, Doug, on the prebuilts with startup companies, do you get any personal guarantees on that or is it just kind of essentially a month-to-month? Second, I think you're $450 million of exchangeable notes due in mid '13 are now in the money. Will you change the accounting on that? Third, you've gone from very little in terms of ground leases to about $5 million a quarter in ground lease expenses, can you give a little more color on that situation, which building, if you look at that, is implicit leverage? And then last, if Ray can comment on the Springfield, Virginia submarket.","Michael E. LaBelle","This is Mike. I'll try to cover most of those except for probably Springfield. On the prebuilt deals with smaller companies, they're not necessarily startup companies, obviously. But with all of our leases anywhere where we're making any kind of investment, we're getting security deposits. And those security deposits for companies that don't have strong balance sheets are generally somewhere between 6 months and 12 months of rent. I would say when you're doing a prebuilt space, when you know what is going into the space and you feel confident that on a second-generation basis, that it's going to be releasable with minimal additional improvements, and we have not seen this because we did a bunch of prebuilts at Times Square Tower that have rolled over, and we brought new tenants in those spaces and it's costing us $10 or $15 a square foot to get those new tenants in. We may -- the security might be a little bit less and maybe towards the 6 months, because again, they're not doing any kind of specialized improvement. We don't typically see personal guarantees, but certainly, security deposits. On the exchangeable notes, we do have additional share count that leaks into our equity side every quarter, and you will see that in the last few quarters whenever the stock goes above that strike price, which in the high 90s.","Douglas T. Linde","$99.","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes, $99. So you will see that go in. So when we quote our diluted FFO per share, it includes the additional shares for the quarter based upon where our stock price is in that period. And then the ground leases, we actually started cleaning up the ground leases, I think, 2 quarters ago, and it's all about 2200 Penn and the Avenue in D.C., where we -- that building is on a ground lease with George Washington University. That ground lease has steps to it, so there's a big noncash portion to it. So those buildings are pretty close to stabilization now. So the amount of quarterly ground lease payment that you're seeing this quarter on our highlights page, which I think is $7 million, is pretty -- should be stable going forward. And then you will see on our FAD page that we back up the noncash piece. So that noncash piece over the 65-year term of this ground lease will change. But that's how we handle the ground leases. And we don't really have any other meaningful ground leases in the portfolio. This is really the only large one. Ray, do you want to comment on Springfield?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Sure. John, as you probably know, NGA is now fully in place and operational. In fact, I went for a tour last week at that facility and it's an extraordinary facility. The one thing that is poorly evident when you go there is the lack of parking. And while the defense contractors are on the sidelines just in terms of trying to take down space in response to demands coming out of the NGA, the contractors may be forced out of the headquarters just because they ran out of parking. So while we're not starting, we're having discussions with some contractors and with NGA about future requirements. But clearly, we're not going to go on speculations unless we feel a little bit comfortable about the market. One surprise about Springfield is the fact that there has been a greater supply potential there that we originally anticipated because people are converting old 1950s suburban residential projects into office space and knocking down old hotels and going vertical and office. So there is some supply there. Well actually, one interesting thing about Springfield, for those of you who are familiar with the Washington area, is the FBI is being considered the new law [ph] Pennsylvania Avenue's headquarters, and they're working to identify a government on site that can support up to 2.2 million square feet. Well, that is one of the winning candidates at the GSA warehouse that really is adjacent to our buildings down in Springfield and was the one motivation we did when we bought the site about 7 to 8 years ago. So Springfield in general is flat, nothing really specifically a new site, but we still have long-term optimism about the success of the development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just going back to the New York market for a minute. Doug, it sounds like on 250 West 55th, did you guys reduce the asking rents that you're -- for that property? And where I'm coming from is there's clearly been a sort of pause on new leases or leases for the new developments that are scattered around the city. I'm just trying to get a sense for what jump starts that market. Is it purely landlords cutting rent or is it offering increased leasing concessions to compensate tenants who would have to pay the cost of first generation space? Just...","Douglas T. Linde","I would -- let me try to answer that question delicately. The rents that I've been discussing have been to the base of the building. We have -- I don't think you would -- you could say we've reduced our rents. I think our expectations for the building was that we were going to be in the low 80s at the base of the building and in excess of $100, hopefully, at the top of the building, which is pretty consistent with where we've been for the last 12 months. Has the concession offering increased? We aren't close enough with a deal that I want to describe that we're -- we have put on the table more or less concessions. I think that the overall concession package is if you're signing a 15- or 20-year lease, you're getting 12 months of free rent and you're getting a tenant improvement allowance of somewhere between $65 and $70 a square foot depending upon sort of what's defined as the base building. The -- I think that the opportunity for new construction in these large platform-type opportunities that the folks have on the far west side are going to have to follow what we are doing in -- see, I could give you West 55th Street because I think they're going to need a larger tenant commitment to get those buildings going, and I think that the overall pricing\/value equation is going to have to be more expensive from the tenant's perspective to go into one of those buildings and want to be in what we are offering at 250 West 55th Street. So I'm not sure you can sort of use the 2 sites and opportunities as sort of a, as a good sort of catalyst. We're talking about how we're thinking about it versus how other people are thinking about it. Overall, our view is that there are not a lot of large, large users in the market today that are looking for 400,000 or 500,000 or 600,000 square feet. And I believe that's sort of the type of dialogue that at least others have talked about in terms of what it would take to get one of those other developments going.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But just even on the existing, it sounds like for a tenant to either renew in their existing space or move to another existing building, the rent differential and the fit-out differential is meaningful enough where people are happy to pay the $80 or $90 on maybe an existing asset, but not the $100-plus moving to a new one. And just sort of wondering, does it just take an improved economy or is it something else that can help fill up, whether it's at 510 Madison or 250 or even some of the other existing developments?","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think it's going to take an improved economy to do the leasing that we're doing at 510 Madison. I think we have a unique product and we have a unique product offering, and our market target from a demand perspective is strong enough that we feel very comfortable with our ability to lease space under traditional market conditions as I've described today and in previous calls. With regards to the base of 250 West 55th Street, as I've said, we're pricing our block sort of in the middle of the stuff that's available in Midtown on the east side and what I would deem to be sort of the high-quality expensive blocks like 9 West 57th [ph] Street, where I think they're asking $125 or $175 a square foot for the big block of space there. It's totally different market decision in terms of a tenant who's looking at that versus looking at our building. We are -- the efficiencies associated with what we are building at 250 West 55th Street and the ability to use that space in a manner that is cost-effective for -- particularly for law firms and other smaller financial institutions, I think is very, very attractive. And I believe that the value that we are offering to tenants is something that is enticing them to spend a lot of time and a lot of energy thinking about how that building might fit into their own overall operating profile from a profit and loss perspective. And so we're getting good activity on that. And we're confident that we're going to be filling the building up at our current pricing, but I don't think we're going to be offering the same type of transactions at the top of the building. But the market for the top of the building is a different market than the market for the base of the building in terms of what we -- our expectation is for the types of users that are going to be up there.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just second question is, if you think about the next generation of the $100 rent payers for New York, you guys do not -- you don't own anything in Midtown South. It's not been a market that you've traditionally been focused on. But clearly, there have been a lot of tenants flocking to that area, especially in media and tech. How do you -- do you have to own something in that submarket to cultivate relations with those tenants or is it just simply through the broker networks? You actually don't need to own assets in that market.","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think you have to own buildings to have good relationships with tenants. I mean we have relationships with lots of high-tech tenants, the more mature high-tech tenants in either Cambridge or in San Francisco or in Reston or in Chevy Chase that allow us to have good dialogue with the tenants that understand what they're looking for. I think that the most interesting question to ask yourself is whether or not there's going to be a migration of the more mature tech tenants as they grow into more traditional higher-quality office buildings because the product that is located south of 20th Street is a unique product, but it is not the type of product where a 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 square foot tenant can be. It's where a 20,000 or a 30,000 or 40,00 square foot tenant can be. And as we are witnessing in San Francisco, there's a limited amount of better quality space or brick and beam cool space that these types of tenants can go into, and over time, the more mature ones migrate to the traditional office buildings. And if the building has the right image and it's marketed appropriately and is positioned appropriately, it can be a very attractive place for a tenant that's not a traditional financial services firm to create the image that it wants to create and the cool factor they need to attract employees over a long term. So we'll see what happens with Midtown South in terms of sort of how the supply and the growth of those tenants sort of move. If for the next 4 or 5 years the growth in that market is based upon new venture capital startup companies that are 5,000 to 10,000 square feet and they're going to grow at 2,000 or 3,000 square feet per year and they don't -- none of them sort of take off, I don't think that they're going to migrate to Midtown. I don't think they're going to migrate downtown to the new inventory there. But if some of those companies really explode and become larger mature companies, I think that's the question. It will be, where will they go then? And there are -- they have opportunities in both places.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Doug, can you just talk a little bit about, given your comments on the various markets, which projects on your 9-million-and-change of owned and optioned land might make sense to start the next 12 months?","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think that there is an expectation that we're going to start anything on spec in the next 12 months other than if we are successful at leasing up this 120,000 square-foot building outside of Fort Meade. And if the leasing activity really is as strong as we think it might be, the building could be filled by the end of 2012, and we would start another building if that were the case. So I think that will be the one place where we would consider a speculative building. Other than that, it's going to be based upon finding a tenant to be a lead or a significant occupant in one of our assets. And I can't tell you where that might occur, but there are conversations that are going on in Waltham and there were conversations that have gone on in some of our product in the Washington D.C. area. But there's no sort of specific site that I can point to and say, that's the one that's going to go next.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then your land bank has been sort of relatively stable for a while now. I mean, how aggressive are you guys these days on pursuing land for future development given those comments?","Douglas T. Linde","We are aggressive about looking at sites, so as an example, if we could find another couple of sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I think we would be aggressive about taking a land position there. We are looking for additional sites in Midtown Manhattan and other parts of that city. Obviously, just simply buying land and hoping that the market is going to improve over the next 10 years is not a terribly ideal structure. So if in effect, you can option land or you can put yourself in a position where you can control a parcel, that sort of would be more attractive to us. There are a number of sites in Mountain View that our San Francisco team is in discussions with that might be long-term development opportunities or redevelopment opportunities, and we're in [ph]. And the folks in Washington D.C. continue to figure out where the next area of opportunity from a new development growth perspective is going to be, and these are not traditional sites that you sort of look at and say, oh, well there's a parking lot and we're going to  put a building up there. It's how do you reposition  a building or how do you take a building down, or is there a particular public action committee or a lobbyist or entity that owns a particular piece of property that might be prepared to move and have a higher-density product put on, on that current piece of ground. I mean, there are -- we are constantly engaged in those types of conversation.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one quick for Mike. After -- you've got $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and you talked about the debt, the $800 million or so of debt that you're going to take out in this year. I mean, what's the sort of optimal cash balance for you guys to be running at on a go-forward basis given the financing needs for the current development pipeline, as well as any being able to fund acquisitions on the spot?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, I mean, I think that we're comfortable with where we are today. Our development pipeline has a little under $800 million to spend, but it's going to take 3 years to spend it. So after we refinance our 2012s, we'll be just over $1 billion. And we got probably $300 million to spend in 2012 on our development approximately. So we should have a pretty decent cash balance throughout the year, and we're constantly looking at what the opportunities are in the acquisition side. So with that, we have the liquidity to be able to act quickly on any type of acquisition. And given our line of credit that has $750 million and our cash balances, we have more than sufficient liquidity today to be able to act on anything that we could imagine on the acquisition side. So do we have too much liquidity? I don't think you could ever say you have too much liquidity. But we're certainly comfortable with where we are, and if we had a little bit less than this, I think we would still be comfortable with that level of liquidity.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. So currently, you're comfortable with whatever the dilution winds up being on running at that sort of cash balance, given the inability to invest that in any meaningful manner. I mean from a cash management standpoint at 10 basis points, so whatever you're getting.","Michael E. LaBelle","We are because we think that we are going to have the opportunities to put that money to work. In the relative near term, if you look at the last couple of years and our success in making acquisitions in 2010 and 2011, it's been pretty strong. And I think we will continue to look at our cost of funds and our opportunities because as rates continue to be low and borrowing costs continue to be low, if we are successful in spending some of this capital or we feel our opportunities are stronger, there's certainly the possibly that we would raise capital at these rates, on a long-term basis, again to, as Mort said, take advantage of that. So that when we do find these opportunities, which we believe we will, the margin will be that much better on those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caton.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on a comment you had on the investment environment. I think you said that last year, you expected better opportunities in 2012. I wonder, was there anything specific you are watching in terms of a catalyst that would drive asset sales?","Douglas T. Linde","If you're talking about a macro trend, the answer is no. If you're talking about discussions that we've been having with various owners of pieces of our property and institutions that we expected would likely sooner rather than later do something with their assets, I think that those conversations led us to believe that the sooner was coming in 2012 and probably was not going to be delayed further than that in terms of their own expectations. And today, that's what we have seen occurred.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, just I meant thematically. Is it funds on [ph] setting or debt maturities, is there anything thematic that you are watching?","Douglas T. Linde","I think most of the entities that are doing this are doing it for different reasons. Most of the funds that own assets will still have 3 to 4 years of debt extensions to go. But quite frankly, they're looking at the interest rate environment today and saying, geez, 2014 is interesting, but expectation that 2014 interest rates going up are probably better managed with period of time between now and then. So the value that we think we might be gaining from that interest rate environment is heightened today versus what it might be if we sort of hold on. I also think that a lot of owners of assets are becoming less enamored with this prospect of growth in the cash flows from their assets over the next couple of years, particularly if they're not on the ground and they don't have an operating team that can actually do something creative about improving the cash flow characteristics of those buildings. So they look at the underlying interest rate environment and they look at their own opportunity set to increase cash flows and say, aside from the fact that we're borrowing money at a very low rate or however it may be and we're getting a good yield on a relative basis from a spread investing, if we have to exit, now's probably not a bad time to exit.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And I have a quick one for Ray, just on 601 Mass Ave [ph]. The added availability, as Doug noted in the market, is that affecting rate negotiations or discussions that you're having on a forward basis?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, one of the great things about having a building situation is we don't have to lease the building. In other words, we'll do deals that make sense to start it. There are a couple of large blocks, especially in the Metro center area. The Howrey space coming back, the relocation of McDermott Will & Emery by us over to Capitol Hill, the spec space at City Center [ph], all of that has responded to the market. The fact we haven't put a shovel on the ground means that we can only do what we do -- we're at liberty to do a deal that will make sense to us. So we don't have to respond to the market and build something that doesn't make any sense.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, and then asked in a different way, timing-wise, have these added availabilities kind of delayed your expectations?","Raymond A. Ritchey","No, actually. The availabilities that are just identified now are currently in the market. We're not going to deliver this building well into '15. And if you look -- and we talked about this at the investor conference, we have a huge bubble of law firm expirations coming in '15, '16 and '17. And we think 601 is ideally positioned to knock off one of those major law firms in that timeframe. Virtually, every major law firm is going through a restacking and a downsizing, which is very hard to do in place. And as we demonstrated here at 2200 Penn, even though we may be charging higher rents, if we can get them in a space that is 30% or 40% more efficient than their current facility, we can be very, very competitive even at rental rates that are higher than existing buildings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows [ph].","Unknown Analyst","My first question was already answered, but I'm also wondering, why did you increase your 2012 guidance? Was it because of greater acquisitions, better operations or something else?","Douglas T. Linde","No, it was -- we did have an acquisition, which was not in our guidance before, so that was -- that added about $5.4 [ph] million. And as I mentioned, both in our joint venture portfolio, which we're seeing some modest improvement, and in our core portfolio, where we've had signed leases and lease starts going quicker than we have previously anticipated, it is driving the leasing that we did anticipate to happen in 2012, just starting to be renting sooner than we had anticipated. So it was really those 3 things, and then you offset that by the interest expense, which is only the first couple of months of the year, which is higher, and then it gets to a pretty stable run rate.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just, Doug, I had one question on dispositions. You guys marketed the Princeton portfolio maybe 6 months ago or 9 months ago, it didn't happen. I guess, given the continued low interest rate environment, the improving employment outlook, I'm just wondering, is your sense that there is an increased appetite for suburban assets? And is there something you guys would look to take the market in 2012?","Douglas T. Linde","I think there's an expectation that there's going to be an increased appetite for suburban markets. Remember that one of the big issues that we had with Princeton when we sold it, and I think we were pretty forthright about this, was that there's an enormous gain associated with that, and we're really not looking to create an opportunity to have to reduce the liquidity of the company through huge onetime dividend payments at the end of the year at this moment in time. So to the extent that, again, we're acquisitive and there are some 1031 reverses [ph] that we could do, I think that we would consider looking at some of our suburban assets. In fact, we are -- we've identified 2 or 3 buildings that are currently on the market in suburban Boston that are sort of maxed up with the purchase of the Mountain View assets. So that, in sort of the vein of your question. With regards to Princeton, we really want to get a higher level of occupancy and a better set of cash flows going before we think seriously about the disposition there again. Because our view is that there is an opportunity to dramatically improve the occupancy at Carnegie Center. Right now, it's running in the low 80s and we should be able to get it into the high-80s, mid-90s over the next year or so. And that would clearly improve our desirability of selling that building, those assets if we got there.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do you see enough demand drivers in Princeton to actually get that done in the next 12 months?","Douglas T. Linde","It's all a question of the pharmaceutical and the biotech companies because they are the ones that are, I think, that -- they are the ones who could give you the big prop. There are 2 or 3 large deals that we've done last year. There's pretty good activity in terms of market demand, a lot of it is musical chairs with incremental growth. We are optimistic that we're going to see improvements over the next year or so in the Princeton portfolio, and our team down there is very motivated to get the occupancy up.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Douglas T. Linde","Thank you all for your patience, and we think to all the questions that were answered, I hope we were able to provide you with some insight. We will be talking to you, many of you in Florida in a couple of weeks, and again, we'll see you at the next NAREIT event in June, as well as our conference call in April. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day."],"3679":["Boston Properties, Inc.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his remarks.","Mortimer Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. This is Mort Zuckerman. Let me spend a little bit of time talking about the economy \u2013 since we all work within that environment. The mood out there is really quite despondent. In the recent poll only 40% of Americans say they are satisfied with the economy, this erosion of support is because we are undergoing the weakest recovery from our recession since World War 2 and they have restored the benefits of a rebounding economy have not reached a significant percentage of Americans. In manufacturing we have 300,000 fewer jobs compared to when Obama took office and 1.5 million fewer total jobs than before the recession.","Adjusted for inflation the average wage for an employee in America has increased by a mere 2% since Obama took office and half of that is because of increased hourly pay and the other half is because of increased hours. Ordinary folks are just not sharing the little wealth that has been created. Fortunately lower gas prices have put about $7.5 a week into the average wallet, but the President has lost much of his credibility interaction with the public and so is the Congress. The President is trying to shift all the next tax burdens as a tax on capital or wealth rather than on income or wages and the Republicans want to find ways to help the middle class primarily through a much stronger job market which they don\u2019t believe will come out of the Obama approach.","But it\u2019s that kind of environment that is still the background for what we are all working in. A year ago 65% said the gap between the rich and everyone else had grown over the last ten years and 90% of Democrats and 45% of Republicans want to do something about this gap. So it\u2019s going to be a very interesting political year with the Republicans in charge of the Congress and the President of course as the Chief Executive on the other side of just about every issue.","Fortunately for Boston Properties and its activities and strategy, we have been able to do and continue to do quite well given the fact that we are focused in certain markets and in certain developments within those markets, so I will say to you that we still believe there is a market for what we do. And I think we will be able to describe this as you hear from my colleagues in a little while. I have a little bit of an additional announcement. As you all know at the end of 2014 I completed my previously announced move from Executive Chairman to Chairman of the Board of Directors of Boston Properties. I will still be active in the company and I will obviously continue to share my views on the economy, on the markets and the company\u2019s activities with our Executive team and Board of Directors.","By way of background, I\u2019m just going to say this. I found that Boston Properties nearly 45 years ago my long time partner and great friend the late and very talented Ed Linde, he joined me six months later. We shared a simple philosophy of building and buying first class buildings in first class locations, and first class markets. That may sound simple but it was a lot more difficult to execute. It was made possible primarily because of the wonderful group of people who joined the company over the years and helped grow Boston Properties.","And to one to the largest and I sincerely believe one of the most respected real estate times in the country which remains true to this day. I believe it will continue given an outstanding management team who will continue to ensure that Boston Properties thrives and prospers. I look forward to remaining active as a Chairman of the board and continuing to provide my support to the company\u2019s efforts. I want to thank you all for supporting the company for the years that I have been involved and I wish everybody well.","With that I will just turn the telephone over to my colleagues.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Good morning, everyone, it\u2019s Owen Thomas. Thank you very much Mort. You and Ed Linde certainly built a remarkable franchise over the last 45 years and all of us have walked in properties are very grateful for all your successes on the company\u2019s behalf and we look forward to continuing our work together with you as Chairman of the Board.","This morning I want to address the economic and operating environment, our performance for the fourth quarter and provide an update on our capital strategy and related accomplishments. Let me start with the environment, Mort touched on some of this. We\u2019ve all experienced rather significant and at least in my opinion unexpected volatility in a number of capital and commodity markets over the last quarter. As we all know oil prices have dropped to $45 a barrel -- basically dropped in half in just the last three months.","European economies continue to suffer declining economic growth and inflation prompting strong action by the European Central Bank which initiated a new and aggressive QE program. Many other Central Banks around the world have and will continue to take comparable actions. China announced 7.4% GDP growth for 2014 its lowest level since 1990. Lower interest rates and slower growth outside the U.S have prompted a roughly a 15% rise in the trade weighted dollar over the last six months, and importantly lower interest rates around the world have sparked a reduction in our rates here in the U.S.","The 10-year has dropped another 40 to 50 basis points in the last quarter to a level of around 1.8% today. U.S economic growth has remained reasonably robust; the forecast for this year or for 2014 is around 2.5%. You just saw our fourth quarter announcement of 2.6% and the unemployment rate which more discussed has dropped under 6, though under employment remains definitely high.","So, what does all this mean for Boston Properties? Starting with the property markets. In the short term there has not been nor do we expect much change. We\u2019re not active in any energy driven markets, so we see no direct impact to our tenants from falling oil prices and their associated negative impact on capital investment and employment in the energy sector. We continue to see healthy economic growth in San Francisco, Boston and New York driven by technology and other creative tenancy, while downtown Washington, D.C are driven more by government and law firms continues to experience more difficult leasing conditions.","The longer term impacts of all the recent market moves are more difficult to discern. Lower energy prices should be healthy for consumers, however low oil prices will have a negative impact on energy sector and a stronger dollar will be an obvious headwind for exporters and the U.S. companies with significant non-U.S. activities as evidenced by some earnings reports over the last week.","Now moving to the impacts on the capital market for real estate. Lower interest rate can only add to the aggressive pricing we witnessed for assets in our core markets. Further the downward pressure on growth and interest rates outside the U.S. has likely pushed back the timing for the inevitable increases in U.S. rates. Acquisitions will likely remain as competitive as ever and we believe we can be more patient in the pace of our asset sales and in company financing activity.","Now let me move to results for the fourth quarter. We continue to perform well and made excellent progress in the execution of our business. FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.26 a share which is a $0.01 above consensus forecast. We completed 88 leases in the fourth quarter representing 2.2 million square feet with the New York region being the largest contributor at nearly half the leasing volume. This level of leasing activity is roughly 70% higher than our quarterly averages. And for all of 2014 we executed 362 leases representing 7.8 million square feet of activity an annual leasing record for Boston properties.","The record level of leasing is being driven by not only new development activity but also the early renewals of several significant law from tenants, primarily in New York but also in Washington, D.C. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 91.7% leased down 0.3% from the end of the third quarter.","Now moving to capital strategy, as mentioned our approach will remain consistent with what we have communicated in prior quarters. Given that prime assets in our core markets are trading at higher prices per square foot and lower yields than where we can develop, we will likely continue to be net sellers of real estate while reinvesting raised capital into new development.","Starting with acquisitions, the pursuit of acquisitions remains active but challenging. New investments considered have some type of competitive angle for us, such as providing tax protection through the use of operating partnership units is consideration; working with a financial partner on specific assets or involving properties with a development or redevelopment component where we add value to our expertise.","We also continue to be active in our disposition activity. In the fourth quarter we completed the sale of Patriots Park, the Norges Venture on 601 Lexington Avenue Atlantic Wharf office and 100th Federal Street and the sale of a small land parcel [ph]. With these three transactions along with the sale of five additional smaller assets we sold $2.3 billion in 2014 at 4.25% aggregate cap rate resulting in a $4.50 special dividend to shareholders and the remaining capital to be invested in developments we expect to yield around 7%.","Turning to dispositions for 2015 we intend to remain active. We will continue to focus on non-core assets and transactions where pricing is very attractive relative to the cash flow growth characteristics of the assets. Our expectation is that we will likely have a greater number of smaller transactions in 2015 totally in excess of $750 million in total dispositions.","In early January we restored the contract for the sale of our lease hold interest in the Avenue at a net price of $190 million. The Avenue is a 335 unit Class A apartment building with 50,000 square feet of associated retail located adjacent to George Washington University at Washington Circle and is encumbered by 54 year remaining ground lease. The sale was completed at a 4.1% cap rate; our basis in the asset is $95 million and the total unleveraged return to shareholders from this development is 15.2%. The transaction is scheduled to close in the first quarter and is another great example of the value we add for shareholders through our development activity.","We continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. We did not fully place in service any new assets in the fourth quarter and did add the previously discussed 15,000 square foot expansion of the Prudential Retail Center to our active pipeline which now consists of 11 projects representing 3.3 million square feet with a total projected cost of $2.1 billion.","Our development pipeline is in the aggregate 58% preleased. However, we had a number of important accomplishments in our pre development pipeline which Doug will cover in more detail in his remarks. Most importantly we completed our joint venture agreement with Delaware North for the development of the 1.8 million square foot mixed-use North Station project located adjacent to the Boston Garden. Further we were able to add two potential projects to our pre development pipeline aside at 4th & Harrison Street in San Francisco and a renovation of potential development at the Back Bay Transit Station in Boston. We are now actively engaged with development projects at two of Boston's three major transportation nodes.","We continue to be in the pre-development stage on a significant set of projects with strong potential in all our markets. Over the next year, we expect to be able to add approximately $1 billion in new projects to our active development pipeline, which is followed by a significant number of additional projects for future years all of course, subject to market conditions.","Let me turn the discussion over to Doug for a further review.","Douglas Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Talking to you here from snowy Boston, where we've recovered from the blizzard of January 2015. We were \u2013 in fact, were closed on Tuesday, so we couldn't physically get here, there was a state of emergency. All the roads were closed. So we were unable to get our work out to you as we'd hoped. But we got it to you last night and here we are this morning.","I'm going to organize my comments into three segments today. The current state of our operating markets, I'm going to give you a short update on our existing development pipeline. And then I'm going give \u2013 put a little bit more meat on the bones of our future development activities.","Consistent with Owen's remarks on the overall US economy as we enter 2015, the overall health of the office markets, in our opinion is stronger today than it was 12 months ago. And why do I \u2013 why do we say this. Well, first and foremost, it's the demand from the technology and the life sciences businesses that's really driving things, and it continues to be very strong.","In 2014, there was more capital deployed in the start-up ecosystem than in any year since 2000. Venture capital investing in 2014 was over $48 billion and included more first and second round investment than at any time since 2001. The Silicon Valley and New York City and Boston dominate the share of those investments.","In 2014, the top 20 technology leases in San Francisco totaled almost 3.8 million square feet of demand. The average of the previous four years, which all were strong years, was 1.9 million square feet. In Massachusetts, we had 17 biotech IPOs in 2014 compared to 9 in 2013.","And while the demand from traditional office tenants in the legal and the large financial services sector is not expanding, we believe we're getting much closer to the end of the law firm and financial services space reductions, stemming from changes to space utilization and downsizing. And we're seeing small financial firms expanding and absorbing high quality, premium office space.","One of the DC brokerage firms actually estimates that 80% of the law firms in the DC market have gone through their downsizing cycles. So we're getting closer to the end.","We had a terrific year on the leasing front, judged by our gross volume of activity. And that was driven in large part by the Salesforce.com lease at Salesforce Tower, and our strategic decision to go get in front of our major law firm expirations.","So in 2014 we completed six leases with law firms, with expirations from 2015 to 2022, totaling over 1.4 million square feet. As you can see from our leasing statistics in the supplemental, the mark-to-market we've been describing in Boston was 38%, and in San Francisco 22% positive, all running through the portfolio as we've talked.","The Boston figures are dominated by 139,000 square feet of leases in our Cambridge portfolio, where there was a net increase of over 50%. The New York City portfolio had a very small down hit this quarter, largely due to the fact that the majority of the deals were coming from Princeton, where there were limited transaction costs. And there was only one Manhattan deal in the stats and it was actually a short term extension on a piece of space that was signed in 2010. So, really very irrelevant.","And in DC, those supplemental statistics are really biased by the NII bankruptcy, which resulted in a leased piece of space that was sublet, converting to a direct lease with Leidos in Reston Town Center, and that resulted in a $5 a square foot reduction in rent on 72,000 square feet. If you pull that out, our transactions in DC were actually up 12% on a net basis.","Last quarter, I provided a leasing roadmap for our 2015 earnings projections. This morning my focus is really on the current market conditions that are impacting our portfolio.","So let's start in Washington, DC. The Washington, DC, CBD market continues to be very competitive, since there really hasn't been any significant increase in demand. In the face of this, our DC team is making significant progress on the future explorations which are found in our 50% owned JV properties in the CBD. In December, we completed 250,000 square foot early renewal at 901 New York Avenue where this law firm downside by only 15%.","In three assets, where we have upcoming rollover due to law firm relocations, we are competing for and wining market share. At 901 New York Avenue we\u2019ve 90,000 square foot lease expiration in 2015 and we have leases signed or pending for 55,000 square feet of that space.","At Market Square North, where we\u2019re getting 90,000 square feet back, we have leases pending on 60,000 square feet. And at Metropolitan Square at the end of the year we have a 122,000 square feet lease expiring at the top of the building and the space is probably some of the best space in the entire portfolio and then in the entire city.","It does continue to be a [indiscernible] supply coming into the DC market in the form of partially let buildings for lead tenants, not unlike the building we\u2019re building at 601 Mass, as well as speculative new construction in the CBD NOMA in the Southwest market.","Reston, which offers walkable retail and a great mix of offers in multifamily continues to drive tenants. Small tenant demand is strong. And Bechtel which move to Reston Overlook in July of 2012 continues to relocate additional employees into the Town Center and we are working hard to find space to accommodate their growth.","As we described last quarter and NII filed for bankruptcy, and it resulted in about 72,000 square feet space moving to direct lease with Leidos, a 21,000 square foot expansion by Google to take some of that space, and about 63,000 square feet of immediately available uncovered exposure.","The Omnibus Federal Spending Legislation that was signed in December may result in some limited spending increases in the defense and homeland security areas. And if this finds its way into the program associated with Fort Meade such as the Cyber Command, it should improve our opportunity to see enhanced leasing activity at our JV asset up at Annapolis Junction.","Four of those law firm transactions I talked about were completed in New York City in the portfolio in 2014. And as I said earlier this was a strategic decision since these tenants were all evaluating the large blocks of space available both Downtown on the Far West side and those blocks that were going to become available due to the some of the tenant relocation such as Conde Nast and Time down from the Midtown West market to the Downtown market.","The economics we achieved in these transactions recognized the locations of our buildings in contracts to the potential competition, in other words, we got paid for the kind of sales we had. We didn\u2019t compete on price.","In the case of Weil, we were also able to take a floor back on December and have already listed in an average mark-to-market of over 60%. We also completed an early renewal at the top of the building with the mark-to-market on the initial rent is over 25%, so to give you a sense of the embedded upside at the General Motors building.","We\u2019re actively working to release a 173,000 square feet of our Citi [ph] exposure at 601 Lex that occurs in mid 2016, 90,000 square feet of that is on floor 15, 16 and 17, and we\u2019re under discussion and working with Citi on an early termination and a lease-back. The rest of the space is in the Annex building, the low-rise where we expect to commence a major redevelopment in 2016.","Activities are high in the New York City, rents over a $100 a square foot was almost 1.9 million square feet, which was more than double the activity in 2013, and its risen from the nadir in 2009 of under 200,000 square feet.","We have leased our last available floor at 510 Madison Avenue. While the majority of the high end activity is still under 40,000 square foot on a unit basis and the new leases averaged about 12,000 square feet as oppose to the renewals. Larger transactions above $90 a square foot are becoming more and more frequent on Park Avenue and in the Plaza District.","Princeton continues to outperform the New Jersey markets. We completed almost the 100,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter most expanding pharma companies, and we\u2019re now in lease negotiations with another 250,000 square feet as we enter 2015.","Turning to Boston, the Kendall Square area of Cambridge continues dramatically outperform the rest of the Urban Boston market and asking rents above $70 a square foot. Our prevalent and vacancy rate is under 8%. Migration out of Cambridge is now occurring.","During the last half of 2014 three tenants move to space in the Financial District. The Back Bay and Downtown crossing, because they couldn\u2019t find the space at an affordable price.","In the Back Bay we are underway with our repositioning and re-branding at a 120 Clarendon, the Hancock Tower low-rise, where we have 150,000 square feet availability. Our asking rents on the low-rise space of the Hancock Tower are lower than the rents in Cambridge.","When fully leased the available space of the Hancock should generate close to a 40% increase over expiring rents. The Waltham Metro West market continues to get stronger driven by expansion by life science and technology companies.","Organic growth continues into 2015, a number of suburban life science and tech companies have announced its expansion. During the fourth quarter we completed another 175,000 square foot of leasing in the market including 61,000 square foot leased at Bay Colony. This was the space we toured during our Investor Conference in September bringing our total leasing at Bay Colony in 2014 to over 250,000 square feet. We have limited current vacancy in suburban portfolio, but we\u2019re taking back our 170 Tracer Lane, which is 75,000 square foot building, and taking it out of service and repositioning in the spring and we\u2019re going to be getting about 100,000 square feet back at Bay Colony in October.","San Francisco continues to be the strongest demand in the country with expected Prop M restrictions is also going to be facing availability supply constraints. 2015 will be very similar 2014 with very limited rollover and flat occupancy in all existing portfolio.","During the fourth quarter we completed eight more leases including a vacant leased floor at EC4 with starting rents in excess of $80 a square foot. What actively engage with over 250,000 square feet of full floor tenant with 2016 and 2017 lease expiration, some of these renewals will be with law firms where they are shedding some amount of space, but we see significant opportunities for rental rate increases for both the renewal and the recapture space.","The average mark-to-market over this \u2013 on the starting rent on all these transactions is over 50%. Our current development pipeline continues to show strong leasing momentum. Wolverine took an additional 30,000 square feet at 10 City Point bringing the leasing in our project to 74%.","We have three leases under negotiation at 888 Boylston Street, which would more than double our commitments to over 260,000 square feet. We\u2019ve completed two additional leases at 535 Mission bringing us to 202,000 square feet of sign leases or 66% lease at the end of the year and we have a number of active full floor proposals under discussion there.","We leased all of the office space at 690 Folsom, which was delivered in early December. The Avant, the residential building in Reston is now 84% leased after 13 months. 601 Mass Ave in Washington DC signed it first retail lease for 12,000 square feet and we\u2019re in negotiations on the remaining 6,000 square feet of that retail.","We anticipate delivering building to A&P, Arnold & Porter, per the lease during the third quarter of 2105. At 250 West 55th Street, we ended the year at 79% lease. We continue to have success with small tenants and continuing our prebuilt program on the 38th floor where we\u2019ve done two leases of 5600 square each in the high 90 starting rent.","Another 13,000 square feet of prebuilt is under lease negotiation and there good full floor activity on a portion of the remaining floors. Construction at Saleforce Tower continue to progress with the mid 2017 delivery for space at the top of the building were not yet in the window for any lease expiration driven leasing under 100,000 square feet.","Our marketing team continue to activity market the building across the bay area both urban and in the Silicon Valley and there is a continuous flow of users that have expect interest in the building and we have commence preliminary conversations with the few large tenants for the building for delivery in 2017.","Before I turn the over to Mike, I do want to provide some commentary on our future development pipeline where we really didn\u2019t make a lot of significant progress during the fourth quarter.","The press release announced the official commencement of our venture at North Station. We\u2019ve also garnered our first lease commitment for the retail podium. Star market has taken 62,000 square feet to put in a full service grocery store and we are in decisions with the number of other retailers, as well as office tenant for various portions of the podium structure. Design documents are progressing and over the next few months along with our partners at Delaware North, we will determine the phasing of the project and how and when we will sequence the construction.","Again, earlier this month we completed an amendment with the state of Massachusetts for the Back Bay Garage leasehold. We agree to a 45-year extension of the ground lease, so it\u2019s now a 99 year ground lease. We agree to prepay the ground rent. We agree to manage the refurbishment of the Back Bay Train Station which will be paid for by this Commonwealth of Massachusetts.","We agree to take over the property managing and leasing of the station. And most importantly, we created the mechanism to potential add additional density to our existing Clarendon Street Garage plus a separate parcel adjacent to the train station and the garage.","We have not yet advanced any plans for these air-rights parcels nor have we had any detailed conversations with the City of Boston or the local community. This will come as we work furiously over the next year to advance our planning.","In San Francisco, we\u2019ve executed an option agreement on a 2.3 acre site at 4th & Harrison and to assist the long term owners, the Barrett family with the permitting process on this block. The site is located in the heart of south of market area and it is two blocks from stops on the new central subway line on fourth streets that connect Caltrans to the city.","Based on the pending Central SoMa zoning, approximately 780,000 of office retail and\/or residential can be built on this site. We will however require Pro M allocation before we commence development.","We are in advanced discussion on the development project in an outer borough Manhattan probably one of the worst-kept secrets in the city, as well as another site in Waltham, Massachusetts that would include building that could be under construction in 2015 and the potential for a million square feet of additional office and retails development, that\u2019s on a joint venture basis.","We continue to chase a large GSA consolidation requirement for our Springfield, Virginia landholding and we are in design in permitting for 500 residential units and 25,000 square feet of retail development in the Reston Town Central urban core on our signature site.","So as Owen suggested we may not be making much acquisition headway, but we continue to dramatically expand our opportunities to put our capitals to work through our development activities.","And with that, I\u2019ll let Mike go through our results for 2014 and our 2015 guidance.","Michael LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Dough. Appreciate it. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to start with the couple of comments on our capital markets activity. As Owen mentioned, we have successful closing of sales of Patriot's Park and the portfolio of sale of 45% interest in Atlantic Wharf, 100 Federal Street and 601 Lexington Avenue this quarter.","The returns associated with these deals reflect the strong value creation that we can achieve through the development process, as well as the smart and disciplined acquisition strategy. The unleveraged IRRs we generated with these investments were strong and total 10% for Patriot's Park, which is over 16 year whole period and 15.5% for the portfolio sale. ","I do want to point that the $970 million gains on sale for the portfolio deal is reflected in our financial statement has an increase in our paid in capital account combined with the decrease in non-controlling interest and property partnerships to account for the debt assumed, and not as a simple gain on sale as you might expect.","This accounting treatments stems from the fact that we have maintained operating control of the buildings and we will continue to consolidate them under GAAP. We were also active in the debt market this quarter. We refinanced our $150 million expiring mortgage loan on 901 New York Avenue. The old loan had an interest rate of 5.19% and the new 10-year mortgage loan which is for $225 million, it has a coupon of 3.61%.","We locked the rate when 10-year treasury rates were in the 2% range and with rally in rate this we think we can price a new 10-year in the bond market today in the 3.8% to 3.25% area. This quarter we also regained $550 million of our unsecured notes that were set to expire in mid 2015. That resulted in a debt extinguishment charge to earnings of $10.6 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter.","This was relatively high cost debt with an average coupon of 5.34% and the redemption was funded with the portion of the net proceeds from our sales activity and was included in our prior guidance.","Our projections don\u2019t include raising new debt capital in 2015, but given the low interest rate environment we are evaluating various hedging strategies including both traditional interest rate hedges and potentially early refinancing of a portion of our 2016 and 2017 debt maturities that have an average coupon of 5.8%.","Our current cash on hand is nearly $2.3 billion after funding our special dividend of $4.15 per share this week and our forecasted development spend, we project the cash balance at year end 2015 of about $800 million.","Turning to our earnings for the quarter, we reported funds from operation of $1.26 per share which is $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The earnings outperformance came from a combination of core portfolio performance and better than projected development and services fee income.","The biggest mover in the portfolio was from the accelerated recognition of fair market rental revenue associated with Weil Gotshal, who elected to terminate the 35th of the GM building a couple of months earlier than we have projected.","As Doug mentioned we\u2019ve already leased this floor to a new tenant at rent rollup of over 60% that we will have down time in 2015 as the spaces build out. A portion of our fee income this came from the signing of our joint venture agreement at North Station. This enables us to recognize development fees this quarter as well as through 2015 as we finalize the design and plans for the first phase of the project.","We also generated better than projected service related fee income this quarter. Overall we had a really strong year in 2014. Our portfolio generated same-store cash NOI growth of 5.6% over 2013.","As Owen mentioned we sold $2.3 billion of assets at a weighted average cap rate of 4.25% and we delivered $1.5 billion of new developments that are currently 86% leased and our anticipated to generate an initial cash yield which is weighted by 250 West 55th Street of over 6% on stabilization.","In addition we have another $2.1 billion of development underway, with a projected initial cash yield of greater than 7%. And importantly, we\u2019ve already raised the funds required to complete our pipeline which is currently sitting in cash on our balance sheet. As we look at 2015 and as we discussed last quarter we have 580,000 square feet rollover in our CBD Boston portfolio primarily at the Hancock Tower that we anticipate will result in a temporary loss of occupancy and income during 2015.","Again, up on releasing we anticipate a significant uptick in rent from the space, but it negatively impacts our 2015 earnings growth. The majority of this space expired on December 31, 2014. So we expect our occupancy to dip down from its yearend level of 91.7% to closer to 90% in the first quarter before recovering and averaging around 91% for the full year.","In New York City were successful in our large law firm early renewal strategy in the quarter. We completed three law firm renewals totaling 700,000 square feet, the net space contraction was only 40,000 square feet or 5%.","However, one the leases was above market and this in combination with the give-back space we\u2019ll have a negative impact on our 2015 cash NOI. On a GAAP basis these deals have a positive aggregate impact to our earnings due to contractual rental bumps in the leases.","In Washington DC we are in contract to sell our residences on the Avenue project for a price of $190 million. We expect closing in early March and the loss of $5 million of FFO to 2015.","The FFO cap rate which is 3.1% is lower than the cash cap rate that Owen described due to the impact of the ground lease that contained contractual increases that are straight lined for GAAP FFO.","Our projections for the rest of the portfolio are generally in line with our guidance last quarter. Overall we anticipate our same-store GAAP NOI for 2015 to be relatively flat between negative 1% and positive 0.5% compared to 2014 and that\u2019s in line with our guidance last quarter.","We project 2015 same-store cash NOI growth of flat to 1% from 2014, that\u2019s 50 basis points lower than last quarter due to the impact of the law firm renewal in New York. As Doug reviewed we saw good progress in our development leasing this quarter.","Our developments are projected to add an incremental $53 million to $63 million of NOI in 2015. Our non-cash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $90 million to $100 million in 2015 and we expect our hotel to generate $12 million to $14 million of NOI in 2015.","For our development and management services fee income we\u2019re projecting $17 million to $22 million in 2015, this is slightly better than last quarter due to higher expected development fee income.","There\u2019s one item I do want to point out in our fee income that our GAAP fee income excludes cash leasing commissions that we collect on our consolidated joint ventures that in accordance with GAAP accounting, are recognize as a reduction non-controlling interest and more importantly they are amortized over the term of the respective leases which could be 10 to 20 years. If these joint ventures were unconsolidated we would earn the fees in the period the lease was signed. This quarter we collected $7.8 million of these fees, which is reflected in our FAB.","We project our G&A expense to be $96 million to $100 million in 2015 which is lower than our projection last quarter. As I mentioned we have no material 2015 debt expirations and our guidance does not assume any additional financing activity during the year. Our net interest expense projections are unchanged from last quarter at $415 million to $425 million for the full year and includes $40 million to $50 million of capitalized interest associated with our development activities.","Our non-controlling interest in property partnerships will be higher than in 2014 due to the sale of a 45% in the three asset portfolio to Norges. Because these properties remained consolidated, a 100% of the NOI and interest expenses reported in our consolidated statements and the net income allocated to the non-controlling interest is deducted separately. We have provided a page in our supplemental financial report that reconciles our non-controlling interest so that you can calculate the deduction from FFO.","For the full year 2015, we project the FFO deduction for non-controlling interest and property partnership to be $135 million to $145 million. So if you combine all of our assumptions it results in our projected 2015 guidance range for funds from operations to be $5.28 per share to $5.43 per share.","Despite the loss of $0.03 per share from the sale of the avenue, we are increasing our guidance range by $0.03 per share at the midpoint. Our guidance increase includes $0.02 per share of projected improvement and the contribution of our developments $0.02 per share from lower G&A and $0.01 of higher development fee income. We have not included any additional asset sales in our guidance.","In the first quarter of 2015, we project funds from operations of $1.22 or $1.24 per share. As in the past our first quarter is always our weakest quarter due to the seasonality of our hotel and the timing of the accrual for payroll taxes investing in our G&A.","With the addition of the residences on the avenue through our disposition program the aggregate impact from our disposition activity since 2014 is the loss of $72 million of FFO or $0.42 per share in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition, we paid $770 million or $4.50 per share special dividend to our shareholders. Despite this sales dilution we still expect to grow our FFO in 2015 with the strong contribution provided from delivering developments and lower interest expense from reducing our debt which in aggregate add over $90 million of incremental FFO to 2015 at the midpoint of our guidance range.","In addition we have retained nearly $1.2 billion of sales proceeds for redeployment in our active development pipeline. That completes our formal remarks; I\u2019d appreciate if the operator would open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael. If we look at the residences at The Avenue sale, you had a comment about NOI support in your press release. Just wondering if you could share some details of what that entails with us ","Owen Thomas","Sure. So the weighted transaction restructured was exactly $196 million purchase price and to the extent that NOI is less than a particular number over the first I think six years of the property performance we effectively have agreed to make up the difference to the tune of a total of and a maximum amount of $6 million. So effectively for purposes of accounting we are only going to book $190 million sale and we have a $6 million receivable effectively there that will if we actually paid out then it will nothing will change if we don\u2019t pay it out last $6 million of additional gain later over the period.","Michael Bilerman","That's helpful. And then maybe just more generally, was wondering if you've seen any changes in the investment landscape across your sort of prime CBD market, especially from foreign buyers? And maybe as a secondary, that if the drop in crude oil prices has led to any more recent changes in that environment?","Owen Thomas","Michael, it\u2019s Owen, I\u2019d say no. I think that I can\u2019t point to a large number of significant trades there, but my expectation is that lower interest rate could make cap rates even more aggressive in our markets. And given that a number of sub and wealth funds are driven by oil revenues that is a very logical question you ask but I haven\u2019t seen any tempering of enthusiasm from there, because of lower oil prices. So we expect that he interest in our core markets by offshore investors will continue into 2015.","Michael Bilerman","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jamie Feldman","Good morning. I'm hoping you can talk a little bit more about your comments on New York City. I think you had said you are seeing a pickup in 99,000 square feet and larger leasing activity on Park Avenue. Financial Services firms, boutiques getting a little stronger there. So I guess just kind of big picture as we are thinking about the year ahead, how is Park Avenue stacking up versus some of the other submarkets? And what are tenants -- what is kind of tenant desiring now for like some of the -- for either downtown or for the Hudson Yards versus some of these more traditional submarkets? ","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to take the first crack at that?","John Francis Powers","Sure. Yes James, New York is in terrific shape now and on every measure if you look at tourists, if you look at employment; if you look at the number of people living in the city pretty much every variable is positive. As it reflects the leasing market I think the text are commission very well and you are seeing some expansion on the Midtown south into downtown and also into Midtown particularly the western part. And as Doug said, the financial market on the high end is doing very well also. So the availability rate has dropped about a point and were looking forward to drop all this year.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Any thoughts on prospects for rent growth in Midtown over the next year?","John Francis Powers","Well I think that we are going to continue to see more upward pressure on rent than balance pressure. The availability rate however historically is still fairly high for rate what I would call event spike or event pop, although you have seen that certainly in some sections of the City and Midtown south certainly on the high end market we have a lot of activity at the over $90 and over $100 number that Doug mentioned that carrier has been cracked in a way it hasn\u2019t been since 2007. So I think that there is still going to be upward rent but perhaps not the rent spike until that availability rate drops down certainly to single digits.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, and then just if you were to think about if the pendulum of demand, how maybe a year ago, Hudson Yards was very interesting to people, talking to brokers and some of the other companies, maybe that swung a little bit more towards traditional Midtown submarkets now, is that -- are you seeing that as well? Or it hasn't really changed?","John Francis Powers","Well the Hudson Yards has been very attractive to the very large users that needed a block of space because finally you have got some space in Manhattan has been very difficult except of course downtown and most of the large, most of the deals done there have been through large organizations to set a land on very large blocks of space.","The balance of Midtown has been very active and continues to be active. We\u2019re seeing very good activity at 250 now, 510 is pretty much done. When we get a floor of the GM that went quickly. So, with regard to the occupants of the vacancy we\u2019ve going to have at 399, we\u2019re pretty optimistic on that, that\u2019s the City space and the Morgan real space that were rolling it\u2019s like 17. We are already working on that and we are already seeing good activity.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just a follow up for Michael LaBelle. Can you talk about the better G&A outlook what moved that?","Michael LaBelle","So our G&A for 2014 was about $98 million, $99 million and there was still some costs in there from the transition of the CO that we had. So those costs are basically out of 2015. So 2015 now excludes those costs and has a kind of a general increase that we typically have for our competition.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right\u2026.","Michael LaBelle","So we basically did, we finalized all of our competition process over the last two weeks and we have put in what we actually have for raises and anticipated bonus accrual for 2015 in the numbers now.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right, thank you.","Michael LaBelle","I just want to make one more comment on New York City because I mean I did someone else that would put out a \u2013 what\u2019s going on with City. And I want to relate it to what we did, so the reality of the situation in New York is that for large tenant demand there are three primary choices. There\u2019s the renewal in place, there is the new construction on the far west side those have Hudson Yards or a Brookfield's project or there is the new construction and the huge availabilities downtown. The pricing opportunities on those two new constructions of areas are subsidized in some way shape or form how do you want to characterize it.","And so, and recognizing that a large tenant with a 2017 to 2020 lease expiration in Manhattan have reason to look at those types of alternative, we made a decision that we were better off trying to cut those deals early at rents that we considered to be market rents for our space when we did that, which basically put our portfolio in the situation that we are now in which is the bulk of the availability that we have is in very small chunks of space in the higher portions of our buildings where we have the ability to achieve more premium rents than we might have had we allowed these various tenants to sign lease expirations that were going to bring them out of those buildings two or three or four years from now where we really didn\u2019t know when we were going to get the space back, what their market conditions might be.","So, that those big blocks of space still remain the city and they have an impact on large tenant leasing, but they don\u2019t have that same impact on the single floor at a General Motors building or the single floor at a 510 Madison Avenue or a single floor at 399 or a single floor at 601. So we feel really good about how we have strategically positioned our portfolio in the context of what will likely happen in Midtown Manhattan and downtown Manhattan over the next three or four years.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And what do you consider the cut off when you say big buck?","Owen Thomas","John, what your deal [ph] 250,000 square feet?","John Francis Powers","Well, yes I would say 250 or more, most of the deals they have gone to the west side or gone downtown have been launched into that. I\u2019d say probably the average size is more like 500, but certainly a 250,000 foot user has few choices in Midtown.","There are -- in addition to what Doug said, there are a couple of choices on 6th Avenue, one or two and that was another price point, clearly our renewals were done at a higher price point than that also. But those are essentially the choices that rush tenants out Downtown, Westside something on 6th or stay in place.","Jamie Feldman","And is there a pipeline at all of new 250,000 square foot plus users like anywhere new to the market that\u2019s looking for that much space?","John Francis Powers","Well there\u2019s always new users but when you just shove them further in the future. So the 19s are pretty much done now and people are looking that 20s and 21s research [ph] prices. So those tenants are starting to get in the market interviewing brokers. ","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thanks for the added color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Good morning guys. How is the early law firm renewal process going so far versus your initial expectations, maybe if you were scoring yourself on your internal score card? And how much more of that program do you think you can complete in 2015?","Owen Thomas","Can I jump in on the first one since we look at lot of these? We targeted and we\u2019ve done four out of five and we\u2019re still working on the last one.","Douglas Linde","And in our other markets we had one on Boston which we completed and we have had three in Washington, D.C, one of them is done which I described one of them. We are in negotiation to complete and third one we made the decisions that rental desire to that kind we\u2019re not comparable with where we thought the space would be allowed to be let by other tenant and so we chose to move on.","Owen Thomas","And that doesn\u2019t have an exploration of 2019 Doug.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And the renewal in New York that had a role down was that unexpected roll down or did that come just you doesn\u2019t landed that sooner than you\u2019d initially thought?","Owen Thomas","I\u2019ll give you the specifics there was tenant that did at least 10 years ago and their rent was $135 a square foot and that\u2019s above markets for they were in the building at 599 and we could resell them to at market rent.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And then on the San Francisco option agreement, can you just talk about your expected timeline for moving through the permitting process on that? And if you were successful in permitting, do you feel like that's a project for this cycle potentially or are you more likely looking at a future cycle?","Owen Thomas","I\u2019m going to let Bob answer the question if the site were permitted today it would be just cycle project, but I think that the matter is that it\u2019s not going to get permitted in short order. So Bob, you want to you sort of give a perspective on the permitting process.","Robert Pester","Sure. This site falls within Central SoMa which is the master plan by the city right, that\u2019s not expected to actually be in place until sometime in 2016. They say first quarter probably be beyond that. So it definitely is going to be next cycle project based Prop M allocation and the Central SoMa quarter plan.","Owen Thomas","But this site is in the heart of where all the activity is right now. I mean, if this site were available today, we probably would have significant demand for the larger tenants because of \u2013 proximity to the central subway line and the configuration of the site and the fact that we can do a really large floor plate.","Jed Reagan","Boston Properties' move their local offices to that building?","Owen Thomas","I don\u2019t think we have enough demand for the size of floors that this building would allow to have. So we\u2019re probably better off, a more traditional size floor plate.","Jed Reagan","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Doug, I wanted to know what you\u2019re saying with construction cost and whether it\u2019s more pronounced in any of your markets than the others. And when you talk about building to over 7%, are you expecting much in the way of cost inflation?","Douglas Linde","Okay. Let me answer the question in the following way. As much deflation as there is in the overall economy right now in terms of impacts of oil prices and the impact of other commodities, it\u2019s not being reflected in reductions in construction costs in our markets. And that\u2019s largely due to two things.","The first is that the overall amount of activity in our markets on a relative basis is probably higher today that\u2019s it\u2019s been at any time over the past five or six years, so there is more institutional, residential, as well as commercial development going on in New York City, in Washington, D.C, in Boston and in San Francisco than there has been in quite some time.","The other thing that has occurred is that during the downturn there were a number of contractors who basically gave up and either went out of business because they decided it wasn\u2019t profitable, or they were forced out of business, because they couldn\u2019t make ends meet. So there are number of quality contractors that are around to do the kind of work that we need to have done has been reduced.","And so there has been somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5% to 4.5% annualized increases in construction budgeting over the past year or so. And that is what we are using as we plan our projects on a going forward and that\u2019s all baked into our numbers. And we really don\u2019t expect to see much in the way of a change in that. In fact in some of the cities, some of the larger projects like the potential casino that\u2019s going to be built in Everett [ph] and the current casino that\u2019s being constructed at National Harbor are major users of both materials and labor and given that the revenue models of those types of projects are such that time is particularly important. They are prepared pay whatever takes to get resources and that impacts the overall availability from a construction perspective in those markets as well. So we\u2019re seeing it and we don\u2019t expect for it to abate further.","Michael LaBelle","Just add to that Brad. On the projects that we have underway which is $2.1 billion that I indicated and Owen indicated had a return of over 7%. The vast majority of the cost associated with those prices have been bought, because those projects are underway. We have GMPs on contracts in place for those projects. So we\u2019re protected on those. The place where cost increases would have more of impact is the future stuff that Owen had mentioned and Doug had mentioned where we\u2019re building that into our budget based upon the timing of when we think those projects are going to happen.","Brad Burke","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026","Michael LaBelle","Yes, just before and there is more [indiscernible] and Owen probably should talk about it, which is, I mean interest in our component and where people\u2019s returns expectations are also sort of a part of this whole process.","Owen Thomas","Yes. Well, look I think that given lower interest rates and lower return generally available in the world, I think that\u2019s going to contribute to compression in the yields that investors are looking for in the development projects, and but that impacting land prices directly.","Brad Burke","And with the 15 basis points decline that was same maybe more than that over the past couple of months. Are you seeing that yet and expectations and the pricing on assets or is it more anticipated?","Michael LaBelle","I think we are seeing it. If you look at land price escalation that\u2019s occurred in San Francisco, I mean, some of it is clearly due to above inflation levels of rent increases that\u2019s driving some of it, but I think some of it definitely driving, is driven by returns. As we underwrite some of the sites that have been \u2013 that have sold they certainly are not being sold at least on our underwriting at 7% yield.","Brad Burke","Okay. And then, Mike, as we are looking at the trajectory of FFO over the course of 2015, I think the full-year guidance is coming in line with what a lot of us were thinking about. The first quarter is lower, and I realize there are a lot of moving parts. But I was hoping you could help us think about FFO trajectory over the year, whether there's anything unusual in the first quarter beyond you had pointed out the normal seasonality with the hotel business and G&A?","And I know you are expecting -- I think you had said $53 million to $63 million from those recently completed developments. But can you give us a sense of how much of that you are expecting in the first quarter? ","Michael LaBelle","So I would expect that our FFO would improve as the years goes on. As I mentioned in the core portfolio, we expect our occupancy to be at low point in the first quarter and will improve going forward. So I would expect to improve modestly throughout the year.","And on the development side, you\u2019re also talking about in the first quarter a contribution of that $53 million to $63 million are being similar in the $12 million to $18 million. And incrementally growing every quarter as we continue to lease up some of the projects like 250 where we\u2019re doing leases on prebuilt that are coming in. The Avant every quarter we\u2019re seeing probably 20 additional units being leased by the end of the first quarter that should be fully stabilized.","And then at 535 Mission, we\u2019re going to have lease up. And then in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve 601 Mass coming on line. So obviously that has an impact on our interest expense, because the capitalize interest for that goes off. But out of the quarter it\u2019s going to paying on their 380,000 square foot lease starting in the fourth quarter. So you\u2019ll see that come into development site.","Brad Burke","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. I guess two questions. One, I can appreciate the decline in interest rates is probably push-down return expectations for many sovereign wealth funds. I'm just wondering, has the strength of the dollar perhaps impacted just the actual demand that you are seeing? Or is it too early to maybe have an impact on the sales market? ","Owen Thomas","Steve, I think it\u2019s a good question and I would say, so far we haven\u2019t seen the impact, not to suggest if this continue that we won\u2019t see some impact. If anything I would say, the strengthening dollar has confirm that U.S. has an interesting areas of investment, because it\u2019s added to the return for the investments that have already been made here by offshore investors. But I don\u2019t see yet as an impact on capital flow.","Michael LaBelle","And just the other component of the capital flow as well as that \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t be discounted. It seems like the Canadians have continue to ramp up their interest in U.S. real estate. So we\u2019ve seen CPP and Oxford and now SPQU all make pretty significant investments in fourth quarter or commitments in the fourth quarter to purchase high quality, well located Manhattan Inn and other CBD market real estate. And so the flow of funds from either Asia or Europe or the Middle East or Canada or the domestic pension fund market which is also has found its desire to expand its allocate, and the real estate doesn\u2019t deal like it is flow down whether oil prices were $80 or $90 or $45 or $50 and when the Euro is was at $1.30 or $1.12.","Owen Thomas","The other aspect too is okay, you\u2019re right, the dollars appreciated, but what\u2019s your expectation for what is going to do from here. Everywhere else around the world as we talked about our going down, yet there is certainly a lot of discussion in the U.S. about when rates are going to be increase. So the positive expectation for the future dollar appreciation is also affect, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s being looked at.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess secondly, as it relates to development, I mean, I know that over the 40-plus years Mort's been building, you guys have generally had a relatively conservative stance towards development business. And Mort was able to navigate the waters in the kind of late 1980's, early 1990's. As we kind of move later into the cycle, are you guys thinking about development any differently? Or has the conservative stance you've always taken just something you could continue to do, or do you make any changes over the next couple of years?","Owen Thomas","I would say Steve that our pension for having strong pre-leasing commitments prior to commencing construction has really been a pretty consistent fanatic way of approaching development. And while it is true that in San Francisco we started 300,000 square foot building on spec, aside from that there really hasn\u2019t been any other development of significance has been done without major pre-leasing effort.","We continue to believe that we are pricing our development properties at a level that is a great in value for the tenants that are our customers. And we\u2019re feeling pretty good above where we are from a business cycle perspective in those markets where we\u2019re building new buildings and where those particular locations are. But we clearly \u2013 it\u2019s been now six or seven years since we obviously had a \u201crecessions\u201d at least from statistical perspective.","So we\u2019re cognizant of what\u2019s going on across the market and we\u2019re also cognizant and as everyone here has described where our overall leasing efforts are on the developments that we\u2019ve commenced. And there is a strong focus on making sure that those things get leased before we put ourselves in a position where we\u2019re adding additional exposure to the portfolio.","Michael LaBelle","And I would add to that Steve if you \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not going to always be the case and we do have landholdings in the company. But lot of what we\u2019ve been doing lately our joint ventures with landholders, the transaction that we did talked about in San Francisco involves an option to purchase lands, that we\u2019re also not employing at least in the some of deals, capital to purchase lands, at least upfront.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","Market in New York driven by the Princeton activity, what would say a normalized kind of mark-to-market would be when you look at your New York City, Manhattan portfolio today?","Owen Thomas","And this is a first part of your question, but I think I\u2019ve answered this question in past quarters and I don\u2019t the answer is changed, which is it is highly dependent on the building. So as we look at the portfolio, the largest exposure we have from a positive mark-to-market is at 76 [ph] Fifth Avenue, the General Motors building, where we had and we talked about this when we purchased the building back in 2008 where we had close to a 1 million square feet of that, almost 2 million square foot building that was let it at rents in the mid to low 80s.","And so, there\u2019s enormous mark-to-market that dwarves everything else. The deals that we\u2019ve been doing at 601 Lexington Avenue under margin have been a positive mark-to-market, not a significant one. As 599 has been a negative mark-to-market on the transaction we\u2019ve done recently with these law firms because most of those yields were done in that 2005, 2006 time frame when market had been exposed to a pretty significant spike.","And then everything that we\u2019ve done in, a smaller building 510 Madison, 540 Madison and he pre-builts and the other deals that we\u2019ve done in 250, at this point today, very positive mark-to-market.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Owen Thomas","Not a 20% but \u2013 so if we did a deal in 2011 at $95 a square foot at 510 Madison Avenue that business probably $150 a square foot today, that kind of mark-to-market, but we\u2019re not going to see that for while.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Regarding the resident sale, understand you guys are thinking for 2015 that your dispositions will be primarily driven by non-core type of assets to make up the 750 for this year. Is residence a non-core asset to you because its non-office or was that just the price you just couldn\u2019t refuse?","Douglas Linde","Yes. So the categories for the sales are as you suggest non-core, there are also assets where we think it\u2019s an interesting price. The Avant is a new asset. It\u2019s in a great location. It is residential but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we considered non-core for that reason. The issue is we got or the attractiveness to shareholders as we received the 4.1% cap rate on a Class A asset that\u2019s on a 54 year remaining ground lease and we thought that was attractive.","Richard Anderson","And what about\u2026.","Douglas Linde","And I also just before you go on \u2013 I just say this, the following about our residential business. So we are a developer. We are not an owner manager in the residential world. We don\u2019t have the portfolio size to be great at operating residential. We don\u2019t have the portfolio size to be creating a business that strategic from the perspective of, well, there\u2019s a need to have a certain massive units to sort of maintain an operating platform.","So we look at the residential business as a way to utilize our development prowess to create a lot of value. In infill locations, in our market. And so to the extent that we don\u2019t deemed there to be strong overall growth in those assets, overall foreseeable point in the future and someone, as Owen said, offers us a terrific price, we\u2019re going to sell those buildings.","So it\u2019s very different than the way we think about our Midtown Manhattan office or our Back Bay officer portfolio or Reston, Virginia office portfolio which have a lot of continuity and operating leverage about them that creates them to be \u201cstrategic\u201d as oppose \u201cnon-core\u201d.","Richard Anderson","Is Princeton long term non-core?","Douglas Linde","Princeton is a terrific portfolio that is well run now by our New York City region. It\u2019s no longer a region in itself which made a lot of sense and created some synergies from an operating expense perspective which has you\u2019re seeing the flowing through our G&A to some degrees. And as long as we continue to believe that this Princeton market will continue to expand from a user perspective and we are seeing marginal to positive rental rate growth and we still have the ability to develop buildings which allow us to create assets that are yielding significantly higher than what we could sell assets for to some third-party, we\u2019re continue to look at as a important portion of the company\u2019s portfolio.","Owen Thomas","And they also I think Princeton, you have to differentiate between Carnegie Center and Tower Center which are different assets and as Doug suggested we\u2019re seeing positive leasing momentum at Carnegie Center, we were investing in the buildings. We started to build-to-suite and we have options on additional development land.","Richard Anderson","Last question at Salesforce you mentioned conversations going on? Are any of those conversations with Salesforce to take on more space?","Douglas Linde","We\u2019re not going to comment on any particular conversation with any particular tenant, it\u2019s not appropriate.","Richard Anderson","Okay. We got it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Two questions. The first one, Doug, you sort of opened the door on the worst-kept secret in New York. So, if there is any color that you can provide at this point on the Naval Yards. And in the Forbes article, it mentioned a partnership with We work in San Francisco and maybe Boston. If you could just provide a little bit more color on that?","Douglas Linde","So Alex, unfortunately, we\u2019re not \u2013 like I said, we\u2019re not in a position of talking about what we\u2019re doing in the outer boroughs of New York, so we can\u2019t comment on what other peoples have written. But we hope that we\u2019ll be able to announce something sooner rather than later. We did a release. We were in straight lease with work in San Francisco at [indiscernible] condition. And at this point that\u2019s the only transaction that we currently have in our portfolio with that organization.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, going again to the declining \u2013 sorry, to the strengthening dollar, declining foreign currency. Does where the dollar has gone versus the pound, does it make you guys possibly want to reconsider looking at London or you've firmly sworn off that market and are only looking domestically?","Owen Thomas","Alex I don\u2019t think the dollar pound moments are driving any thinking we\u2019re having about investing in London.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So you\u2019re only looking domestically, you\u2019re not \u2013 you put London off, it\u2019s not in the strategic view anymore?","Owen Thomas","That\u2019s not what I said. I said we\u2019re not making investment decisions in London or elsewhere based on currency fluctuations.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. I appreciate that clarification, Owen. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks. Good morning. Mike LaBelle, I apologize because I'm splitting hairs here, but you mentioned average occupancy for the year at 91%. I think last quarter you said 91% to 92%. So I'm not sure if that's actually a change or just 91% is still within the range. And I think you previously expected to end \u2013 have a year-end occupancy around 93%. Does that projection still hold?","Michael LaBelle","I think we have \u2013 we did bring it down a little bit. We did say, 91% and 92% last quarter. We still hope to increase our occupancy getting to the 93%, I think will be pretty thought to be honest with you based upon where we\u2019re think we\u2019re going to be in the first quarter, and the fact there are lot of space that we\u2019re getting back in Boston which is again the majority of this, its highly marketable but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of a time to lease and its going to take \u2013 somebody is going to have to build that space.","So, we do not anticipate that, that space is going to be occupied in 2015, it\u2019s going to be 2016 and later. So I would agree that we brought it down a little bit and we think it\u2019s going to average around 91%. It should end above 91%.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Doug you mentioned in Boston, you mentioned at the base of Hancock good activity there. I think you also have 200,000 or 300,000 square feet at the Tower that Mike alluded leasing there. Can you just shed some color on how conversations with perspective tenants are going for the top of the building?","Douglas Linde","It\u2019s some of the best place in Boston we are as we know we like the sort of commonly say baking the cake before we try and serve it at the base of the building with our new rebranding and our new identification of 120 Clarendon Street sort of that new address for those larger floors at the base of the building and we continue to sent proposals on that base at a pretty significant pace.","I think the space at the top of the building, right now it\u2019s a little bit challenging to have conservations because this space is currently occupied by tenant that\u2019s going to moving to the low rise, and when you tour the space its fully occupied with an installation that was build 10 years. It\u2019s not what somebody sort of things about when they want to be in the kind of space that the Hancock will offer you. And so it\u2019s a little bit of a challenge but we also try and bring people to the floor to bottom below them which are just fantastic. But back to the market for that space will be slower than we think the market will be for the space at the base of the buildings that have an attractive value that the place has with the market.","Brendan Maiorana","Yes I think you guys is it April when they moved down, so kind of your expectations on leasing that, do you think it\u2019s maybe a 12 month process to get that leased not a tenant in the space, but just kind of leased?","Owen Thomas","I hope we are leasing people who aren\u2019t listening because we had with them or the lease environment where our projections are at different ends. Our view is that the space is going to get leased really, really quickly; our revenue recognition is going to be a different story. So our view is that we\u2019re going to have really good strong leasing on the space in calendar year 2015, some of those leases may have started for 2016 or later just because of the realities of when these expirations occur in the market place. We just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to \u2013 if we do the space on our [Indiscernible] leasing will probably be a little bit slower but the revenue recognition will be quicker and if we do a larger block of space that revenue recognition will probably be a little bit slower but the leasing and will be quicker.","Brendan Maiorana","Sure, okay thanks for the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley","Vance Edelson","Good morning. First back on 425 Fourth Street regardless of entitlement timing which your provided some color on, how good do you feel about the process itself and the Prop M allocation if you had to rate it somewhere between a slam dunk and very challenging?","Owen Thomas","Bob, you want to take that one....","Robert Pester","Yes there is a queue of 10 million square feet of space to seek in Prop M allocation. I mean this is a fantastic site; it\u2019s a great location the city is going to look to the transportation quarter or in the benefits of being on the transportation corridor. But it\u2019s going to take some time I mean this is not something that\u2019s going to happen very quickly, it\u2019s going to take several years to get approved.","Vance Edelson","Okay it makes sense. And then related to that can you share with us anything or on the potential magnitude of the project what it would be if you got all your wishes that you have put for us on the entitlement, could you ballpark the potential investment?","Robert Pester","It will be approximately 7\u2026 go ahead Doug.","Douglas Linde","Yes we\u2019re really \u2013 I mean basically we don\u2019t like to get in front of the jurisdictions that we\u2019re dealing with, so the current Central [Indiscernible] plan allows for around 750,000 square feet of space, residential office and retail, where at this point is unclear what the right plan should be for the property vis-\u00e0-vis is what we think where the market wants the space to be designed and what the city would like to see happen there. And those two conversations that are going to take place over the next \u201cmonths and years\u201d. Big picture, construction cost for new development in San Francisco are probably including land the whole on the armadillo are well in excess of $800 a square foot.","Vance Edelson","Okay thanks for that. And then shifting gears could you comment on how important New York Street level retail is going to be for Boston properties going forward, is rental growth there something you are optimistic about and therefore is that a presence you\u2019d like to perhaps grow overtime?","Owen Thomas","I think we\u2019ve had this topic of conversation before and I want to make sure I\u2019m consistent with what I have said before. We have a terrific portfolio of retail space with high opportunities for value creation in our existing buildings in Midtown Manhattan namely at General Motors building and at 601 Lexington Avenue and potentially at 399. That\u2019s where the focus of our investment is going to be, so if the question was sort of way to say are we going to be doing what Renado and SL Green and others have done in terms of going after Street we feel Condominium interest in and around the City of New York, I think the answer is at this point we\u2019re busy doing our own portfolio and looking for larger scale opportunities to put development dollars to work.","Vance Edelson","Okay. And yes, you did get the just of the question. And then lastly on G&A it sounds like you have a pretty good forecast and process, what are the main variables that could push it to the high or low end of the new guidance range which is understandably fairly healthy at this point in the year, and do you think there is any chance you could exceed or come in below the range?","Owen Thomas","I think that one of the wildcards in that is that always capitalized wages, and given our development pipeline I think we view that our development team and construction and leasing teams are going to be very, very busy doing transactions. So we have estimated that they are going to be and that\u2019s going to benefit that G&A. I think we are comfortable with the range that we have provided certainly, so I would be very surprised if you see something outside of that range.","And the other tricky piece of this is that our \u2013 if we do a joint venture we don\u2019t necessarily have the ability to recognize that capitalize wage expense. So if some of these properties turn out to be JVs versus wholly owned assets that they can skew the numbers not insignificantly by hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars on any one project in the year.","Vance Edelson","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ian Wiseman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Wiseman","Good morning. Just two questions, first on Salesforce Tower where would you guys expect to end the year with additional leasing in 2015?","Owen Thomas","Ian, I would say that we expect to end the year not to similar to where we are today unless a large non-traditional lease expiration driven transaction occurs. So our view is that as we get to the end of 2015 that\u2019s when we are going to be in the heart of the procurement of leasing conversations with existing lease expirations here with tenants, but that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have another other type of transactions from a user who is looking for big block of space and says, -- there aren\u2019t any big block of space so we are tantalized by the opportunity to be in Salesforce Tower and we engage in a conversation with them early on that. So that could happen, but it\u2019s not really part of our expectations. In the first quarter of 2016 we would hope that we will have some additional leases done.","Ian Wiseman","Got you. And just one last question, just as I think about potential refinancing down the road you\u2019ve got about $2.7 billion of debt on three buildings maturing I think in as I said 2017 at a 5.7% [ph] rate the ten years below 17% today. How should we think about sort of fast tracking some of that refinancing early on and how much capital you think you can pull out of those buildings?","Owen Thomas","Well I think that as I mentioned on my notes, this is something we are clearly evaluating. I mean one of the things we are watching is what\u2019s going to happen to the 10-year over the next three months, six months, nine months, and we are watching it very closely because we clearly have the opportunity to try to do a financing early. Now there is a significant prepayment penalty associated with repaying this debt early. And if you were to do the analysis some of these debts in 2017 if you did it early your breakeven point is 75 basis points to 125 basis points on the 10-year from now until mid 2017.","And if you look at the forward curve it\u2019s telling you it\u2019s going to be 50 or 70 basis points higher than that. So it\u2019s hard to make the decision at this moment in time to go and do that \u2013 pay that kind of prepayment penalty, however I think as we need to focus on, think about how we can hedge that risk. So you \u2013 thinking about interest rate hedges and as we get closer and our view of interest rates may change you may see us in 2015 take some of that financing off the table and do something early.","Ian Wiseman","Ex the prepayment penalty, just where do you think you can get financing for those buildings today?","Owen Thomas","In terms of size?","Ian Wiseman","Well just rate.","Owen Thomas","Well we do a ten year bond today at three and eight three and a quarter something like that. Mortgage is not that dissimilar maybe it\u2019s 3.5%, maybe a little bit higher some of the Life Insurance companies are trying to hang on the floor rates, so some of those floors are in the mid high threes and once you start getting them competing I think that sometimes that goes away and then the CMBS market is also a very effective financing source right now.","So on the mortgage side because with 5 million in Lex, which is expiring and one of those explorations in GM building, both of those are probably going to be secured mortgages, ones JVs and one had a lot of mortgage tax to be paid that has time [ph] so we would look at that life company or the CMBS market which again is probably in the mid three somewhere. That\u2019s a significant savings from the weighted average coupon of 5.8% today. The reason I gave 5.8% is we also have a more use on [Indiscernible] that is coming due in 2016 that we should be able to improve the rate on that as well.","Ian Wiseman","Got you. Thank you very much.","Owen Thomas","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank","Vincent Chao","Hey good morning everyone. Just a final question, I hope, on sort of capital flows and whatnot. Given the comments about foreign buying demand, at least not seeing any change in it today, and also your comments about cap rates continuing to -- or potentially continuing to compress on the back of the 10-year, has that caused any material shift in those types of buyer's appetite for assets beyond just the core gateways? And then maybe a corollary to that, the acquisition market has been tough for you guys for a long time. Have any other markets outside of your current core become more interesting to you recently? ","Owen Thomas","So the first question is given that how cap rates are coming down, our sovereign wealth funds or offshore buyers looking at non-core markets are taking more risk. My view of that is I don\u2019t think I think the perimeter is probably staying pretty much the same. I think core gateway cities is still a primary focus for offshore investors. That being said I do there is a little bit of a trend for some of these groups to go up the risk curve.","So I think you are seeing here particularly in New York there have been a number of Chinese investors who have gotten involved in development projects. So I think if there is a I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a change but I think if there is somewhat of a trend as you might see more offshore buyers moving up the risk spectrum in their real estate investing in core markets.","And then on your second question is, does the aggressive pricing in our core markets today lead us to look at transactions or acquisitions outside of the core markets? As we have mentioned in the past there are a small handful of other cities and areas that are interesting to us because they have certainly they have a strong creative tendency which is driving a lot of growth in the office business today and also these market demonstrate value creation for real estate and office in particular over a long period of time.","So we are consistently and constantly looking at that type of thing, but the issue is the pricing that we described in our core market isn\u2019t substantially different in these new markets I mean the offshore investors are also very active in a number of these places. So I don\u2019t think we would do that because pricing is really substantially different.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","","Hey guys, good morning. Can we talk about the recurring dividend for a second? I know that the Company has been perhaps extraordinarily generous with special dividends, not just lately but in the last decade, but the recurring quarterly dividend hasn't gone up in two years and actually is the same level it was 10 years ago -- and I went back and looked despite the fact that your AFFO is 30-something-percent higher. So I guess the question is, with the Company having a recurring dividend yield under 2%, below the S&P 500, what is management and the Board thinking in terms of increasing the recurring quarterly dividend? Thanks.","Douglas Linde","This is Doug. I think the stated operating philosophy that we have had since the great financial distress of 2008 was that we should make sure that our dividend is appropriately sized vis-\u00e0-vis the taxable income. And that to the extent that our taxable income should be going up, we would be increasing our ordinary dividend. And one of the things that happen when you sell what was the number Mike?","Michael Walsh","$73 billion.","Douglas Linde","$0.72 a share of earnings on your taxable income doesn\u2019t go up as large as much as it might. So it gives push into a return of capital based upon the gains on sale, which I guess are we consider to be a very good thing. So it\u2019s retarded the overall growth in our taxable income and to the extent that that is no longer part of our operating strategy from a capital recycling perspective the dividend is going to go up.","Overtime if you look back, Mike what is it ten years? The average dividend yield for the company has been I think over 4%. So relative to where other dividends are and certainly in our space we think we have a pretty healthy dividend, it just comes in a little bit of bulkier manner as opposed to a constant recurring dividend yield that\u2019s been paid out on a quarterly basis.","Ross Nussbaum","And as you pointed out\u2026","Douglas Linde","Yes and I think we\u2019ve had special dividends in like five of the last ten years. So if you look at that together with the regular dividend than our dividend yield is significantly higher than otherwise.","Ross Nussbaum","Yes and that all makes perfect sense. And if I had been a shareholder for the bulk of that period certainly I would have been rewarded for it, but I am thinking in terms of if I may potential shareholder looking at buying the stock can I rely on getting those special dividends kind of every other year, every three years or what I like to have little bit more security or higher recurring dividend or a better balance between those two in the future.","Douglas Linde","If we don\u2019t sell you will have a higher dividend because the earnings will be significantly higher, but if we continue to sell you will continue to get dividend in the form of a return of capital or gain on sell.","Michael LaBelle","And as the cash flow comes in on your developments, the $2.1 billion that is going to be delivering between 2015 and 2018 I mean that goes right into our taxable income as those cash flows come in, so that will be its nature increase our taxable income and require an increase in our dividend overtime. I mean such if during that period of time we think that sales are the right strategy, then we might have specials.","Ross Nussbaum","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Well that concludes our remarks and Q&A as hopefully we were able to demonstrate, we\u2019ve made terrific progress executing our business, we increased our guidance for the year despite announcing a significant asset sale and we thank you all for your attention.","Operator","And this concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a good day."],"3682":["Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 30, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arista Joyner - Investor Relations Manager","Mortimer B.

Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. I want to begin my remarks this morning with a summary of what I see going on in the macroeconomic front as we have all or most of you, I'm sure, have heard the latest GDP number shows a negative 0.1% growth for the last quarter. I have to say I'm not going to go through all the facts and statistics that lead me to my current thinking since, of course, all of you I know would be happy to read them in my latest editorial in U.S. News, which can be found in www.usnews.com.","But I think we are looking at the weakest economic recovery in terms of the growth of -- in real final sales, employment housing and organic personal income, not to mention that every measure of consumer and small business sentiment is locked in recession terrain. I guess it's probably fair to state that I'm having trouble seeing the roots of the recovery. In my estimation, there are not too many tools left in the government toolbox. We've had the most stimulative fiscal and monetary policies in our history, deficit spending of about $1,300,000,000,000 this past year and monetary policies that, by their own statements, have put in $85 billion a month into the money supply and yet, these policies have failed to reignite the economy. And whatever growth there is cannot be sustained without reliance on government steroids. This is an economy on major life support with virtually 0 economic momentum, and we still face the risk of a major bump from some unforeseen quarter.","I will say that I -- I fundamentally believe that we're still the country with the greatest spirit, the most creative imagination and flexibility, which makes business cycles volatile but brings them to an end. But we can no longer afford to happily ride the roller coaster to the next rise when the vehicle has so many loose rivets. One of the more vexing trends of our current predicament is that hundreds of thousands of employers cannot find workers because the workforce lacks the skills and science, technology, engineering and mathematics that they seek.","The American public, of course, is looking for leadership and renewal. We have, as a country, have learned much as how to sort of develop the needs for an evolving economy, one in the form of incubating the future in graduate and undergraduate universities and labs and business schools, and have attracted many of the world's best and brightest. We also have a unique business culture of individualism, entrepreneurialism, pragmatism and novelty and the people who are mobile physically and mentally given to self-help, self-improvement and self-renovation. So we've been able to manage the ongoing revolutions in technology information and logistics, and to marry a new economy and technology to an older economic culture as we fund the new and not the old.","But I will quote Alexis de Tocqueville who once observed that, \"The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.\" The issues that we face are not about our power and capacity; they are about our will and the quality of our character. Obviously, what we need is a grand bargain at the level of national politics, but this is not possible without the leadership that formulate it and fight for it. So we cannot just continue to post or postpone this kind of inaction. And it hasn't happened yet, and I think this is what is sort of percolating through the economy, a sense of a country that needs leadership at the national level but our politics are so partisan and so divided that we are not getting it. And we need something like that to break through what it seems to me is a level of declining confidence in the business community and the future of the economy.","Having said that, Boston Properties, I must say, because of the nature of its assets and the location of its assets has really performed quite well in this environment and frankly, justifies the basic strategy that we have followed for so long.","So without going into that, I would like to turn this over to my colleagues. And Doug, would you please take on the next conversational slot?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. So I think Mort really did a nice way of sort of segueing into my thought process and what I'm going to talk about this morning because when we think about 2012, we think we had a really great year, particularly from an operational perspective, and we finished the year with a flurry of major leasing activity. Some of it, I think, was described in our press release last night. So we signed 2 major law firm leases. We did a lease with Kaye Scholer at 250 West 55th Street for 246,000 square feet, and we did a second new development at 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, DC that will be getting started. That's a 376,000 square foot lease with Arnold & Porter. We did a 244,000 square foot, 12-year expansion and extension with Covance in Princeton; they're a drug development company. We did a 17-year 200,000 square-foot extension with the Department of Justice at 1301 New York Avenue in Washington, DC. We did a 250,000 square-foot expansion and extension with a company called Constant Contact at our Reservoir Place property in Waltham. And then early January came and we signed 2 more large leases. We did a 78,000 square foot lease with another pharmaceutical company called Otsuka Pharmaceutical in Princeton, and we scored another win with a 50,000 square foot lease with another nascent pharmaceutical company called Synageva in Lexington, Massachusetts.","Finally, we finally received from the GSA a signed lease for the remaining 180,000 square feet at Patriot Park in Reston and did a 20-year commitment. So we've now relet at Patriots Park 706,000 square feet of space that was let go by the NGA. There were 2 specialized buildings. We gutted them and we rebuilt them for 523,000 square feet, and then we leased this last building so we will have full occupancy on that park as of the end of the second quarter of '13. And our Reston occupancy now stands at about 97%, not too shabby.","In total, we finished 2012 with about 5.6 million square feet of signed leases, and that's more than our average over the past 6 years where we have been averaging about 4.7 million square feet. So again, a good year. We completed 2 million square feet in Boston, just over 1 million in New York City, 1.25 million in DC, 0.75 million in San Francisco and 440,000 square feet in Princeton. And I do want to spend just a second on Princeton, because we started 2012 talking about the difficulty we had in executing on our sale transaction largely due, quite frankly, to where our occupancy was and where people's views of the Princeton market were. And so we were at about 81%. While we did a whole slew of long-term extensions as well as new leases, and with the Otsuka tenancy, our occupancy now is at 88% in Princeton and our near-term lease expirations have been dramatically reduced. So it was a really, really strong performance over the last 12 months there.","In the fourth quarter, we did 2.3 million square feet of leasing, a big jump obviously from the other quarters and it was really largely due to these large deals I just described. There were 84 separate transactions versus 74 in the first 3 quarters. And if you look at our statistics this quarter and sort of the second generation, they're really not very informative because so little actually came into play from a revenue recognition perspective on the second generation side. So we went back and sort of said, \"Well, let's look at the whole year and sort of look at what the growth increase or decrease might have been.\" And the sample for the whole year was about 3 million square feet. And on a gross basis, we were up about 7%; and on a net basis, we were up about 9% for the entire portfolio. The average term of the leases during this quarter were about 8 years and the concession package was about $45 a square foot. And right now, our mark-to-market sort of on the portfolio sits at just over $1 a square foot.","I do want to spend a second on the Arnold & Porter lease because it means that we are going to be starting yet another development at 601 Mass Ave. It's a 478,000 square-foot building, there's 25,000 square feet of retail space, and the current budget is about $355 million or $742 a square foot. And we're going to commence development during the second quarter for a delivery of the building in late 2015, and we think that the stabilized cash return is going to be around 8%. As a reminder, we purchased the site from NPR in September of 2008 and we've been earning 5% on that investment through a triple net lease while we have been developing NPR's new headquarters building. NPR moves out of the building on April 1, and we start on May 1. So with the addition of 601 Mass Avenue, we now have $2.1 billion of active developments, which will be delivered between 2013 and 2015; 2 Patriots Park is going to come online in the second quarter of '13; 17 Cambridge Center and our Connector Building with Google and Cambridge Center is going to open up this summer; The Avant, our new residential Reston-named property, will start occupancy in the fourth quarter of '13; AJ7, the new building we're starting up in near Fort Meade, will be delivered in early 2014; 250 West 55th begins revenue recognition in 2014; 680 Folsom Street in the second quarter of '14; and now 601 Mass Avenue in the fourth quarter of '15. So all in all, again, it was a really, really solid year for Boston Properties from an operating perspective.","And as Mort said, we have remained true to our corporate strategy. We focus on select markets, submarkets and buildings, and we try and find unique and differentiated demand characteristics, as well as limits on supply. But quite frankly, we have to do a lot more than that at this point in the life cycle of what's going on in the real estate sector. It's simply not enough just to say, \"Well, we have A buildings and A locations.\" We see changes happening and we have to react to them. Traditional CBD office users are becoming more efficient with their space, and it's leading to organic supply increases. And in a lot of cases, in these cities where they are actually shrinking their footprints, they are choosing to commit to new developments, which is exacerbating the situation and leaving older buildings and creating new net negative market absorption.","So it's really imperative that we have to do whatever we can to enhance the use of our facilities and ensure that our tenants view our assets as places where they can recruit and retain talented employees. We do this with design, with technology, with architecture, with third-party service providers, with creativity. It means that for a project like Bay Colony, we create common areas inside and outside the buildings where tenants can interact in ways that they're complementary to how they're using their own space. It means finding a way to activate the plaza and the concourse of 100 Federal Street in Boston in a way that draws people to the building as a destination, not just as a place for tenants and their visitors. It means spending the time and capital to design and invest in a more inviting and a collaborative way to use the lobby levels at our 3 million square feet Embarcadero Center, not simply to improve the marketability for the retailers but to drive the utilization of that space for tenants in the buildings. It means working with cellular telephone providers to install distributed antenna services in high-rise buildings that allow for dramatically enhanced wireless service within the buildings, and actually save our tenants the significant cost of installing their own networks, so that when you look at your phone, you don't just see bars. You actually get service.","In addition, we are realizing that tenants not only are using space differently, but the profile of the tenants that are anticipated to grow is changing. Job growth in the U.S. today is clearly focused on businesses that are oriented, as Mort said, on ideas, be they in technology, life sciences or medical devices. The markets that have the largest concentration of those industries are going to be the strongest performers and are probably the areas where there's the most opportunity for growth.","Surprise, surprise, Silicon valley and San Francisco CBD continued to experience the strongest absorption, availability, reductions and rising rental rates in the country. During the fourth quarter, Apple and Netflix and GLOBALFOUNDRIES and a bunch of others absorbed 650,000 square feet of office space in the Valley, bringing the 2012 absorption there to 2.5 million square feet. And on the R&D side, another 675,000 square feet was absorbed, bringing that product type to over 2 million square feet for the year. So 4.5 million square feet of absorption in the Valley. There is as much as 8 million square feet of active space needs in the market. And if you asked the brokers, they would say, somewhere around 20% to 25% of that or 2-plus million square feet is growth. Rents continue to rise. In our product in Mountain View, we were doing deals around $25 triple net in January, and we're now doing deals in excess of $32 triple net.","The story in the San Francisco CBD continues to be the growing demand from the tech sector. 2012 had close to 3 million square feet of net absorption following 2011, which had in excess of 2 million square feet. The overall Class A vacancy rate has dropped another 300 basis points, so it's somewhere around 7.5%. And while in the past, there was lots of focus on the desirability of sort of non-core cool brick-and-beam-type space. The story today is that tech tenants are leasing in traditional, high-rise office space, and that's making the biggest impact on the market. Technology tenants now make up 26% of the CBD market in San Francisco and were responsible for more than 2\/3 of the activity in 2012, up from 35% in 2011.","And at the end of the year, Salesforce expanded by more than 1.2 million square feet in existing buildings like 50 Fremont and Rincon Center, as well as committed to a new development. Autodesk expanded at 1 market; Yelp expanded at 140 New Montgomery; the Macys.com and the Riverbed leases that are at our development at 680 Folsom Street are basically 50% expansions in those buildings. These are all traditional office towers.","During the quarter, we leased another 140,000 square feet in Embarcadero Center, 4 more 4-floor deals, 12 total transactions; availability in Embarcadero Center is about 4%. Our near-term opportunities are now limited to the top -- 3 of the top floors at EC4 where I will tell you sort of the one soft part of Embarcadero Center and the market at San Francisco which is the high, high end. So when you're asking $70 or $80 a square foot, it tends to be a little bit slower, and there's not a lot of activity at the moment there.","The Boston area, Life Science Industry is the East Coast's corollary to the technology sector in San Francisco. The Life Sciences are clearly concentrated in Cambridge. But with, quite frankly, the lack of available sites and existing product, companies are growing in Boston and in the Route 128 suburbs. This quarter, Ariad Pharmaceuticals announced another major deal in Cambridge where they agreed to take 350,000 square feet, so there are now 7 buildings under construction in Kendall Square, totaling over 2 million square feet [ph]. And that combined with the Vertex construction in the Seaport District of South Boston means that there's close to 3.5 million square feet of biotech lab construction right now going on in the greater Boston area.","We are effectively 100% occupied in our Cambridge Center portfolio, and we've begun to engage tenants and actually, tenants have begun to engage us on their 2014, '15 and '16 renewals. We are also working with the City of Cambridge to figure out a way to increase the Kendall Square zoning to allow for additional development at Cambridge Center in the future. It's going to be a long process but we think it's going to be one that's fruitful.","The expansion of the Life Science Industry is also impacting the other Boston markets. So I described the lease that we signed with Synageva, biotech company, and they're going into 33 Hayden Avenue and Lexington. This is a 3-story building that was built on the '80s and was the home to Mercer Consulting. It is now a laboratory building with some other traditional office space. The Route 128 interchange in Boston is now home to Shire Pharmaceuticals, AMAG Pharmaceutical, Cubist Pharmaceutical and Synageva. A lot of biotech pharmaceutical activity. And at Bay Colony, we're in discussions with the Waltham headquarter Life Science organization for a 55,000 square-foot expansion. Lots and lots of activity on the life science biotech side in Boston.","In the City in our core portfolio, we signed 2 more leases at 100 Federal Street where we were asking about $60 a square foot. And the city really has seen quite a few major transactions in the quarter that will clearly have impacts going forward. The first is the relocation and expansion of Brown Bros. at 185 Franklin Street. So they're moving out of 3 smaller buildings and expanding there actually. A surprising development of expansion in the financial services company. Goodwin Procter is moving out of 53 State Street or they've announced that they are into a new development in the Seaport in 2016. And Converse has announced that they are moving from North Andover into the city. So lots of activity in the city, lots of low-rise space being let up.","We actually recently received interest and are talking to a tenant about our development at our 888 Boylston Street at the Prudential Center. This is a tenant that's in a downtown high rise that is struggling to find an acceptable building alternative in the market. So they're now looking at new construction. We completed another 120,000 square feet of long-term extensions to Hancock Tower. So overall, in 2012, we did 363,000 square feet of extensions and expansions of leases that were set to expire '14, '15 and on, at the Hancock Tower.","In DC, the impacts of the federal negotiations on the deficit and spending reductions and the continued threat of sequestration is not going to go away in the short term, as Mort described. In 2012, DC experienced really no net absorption and the suburban markets continue to experience some negative absorption. Yet in that environment -- and this is important because it really hones in on, it's not necessarily just the market but the operator in the market -- Boston Properties had an extraordinary year.","Our DC portfolio is 96% leased; we delivered 500. North Capitol, 82% leased and we've commenced a prebuilt program on the remaining floor and we're seeing really good activity on that; we're taking a similar approach to the modest amount of available space we have at 2,200 Penn in Market Square North; we did a long-term extension with the GSA at 1301 New York Ave.; we completed the lease with Arnold & Porter at 601; we signed a 20-year lease with the GSA for the rest of Patriots Park; and we did another 12 leases in our Northern Virginia portfolio, totaling 165,000 square feet, and we continue to achieve rents around $50 a square foot in our Reston urban core portfolio. While a quarter-mile away, rents are somewhere in the high 20s to the low 30s. So while DC may be facing some headwinds in the short term, Boston Properties continues to dramatically outperform the market and create significant value even in a market that is seeing negative absorption.","We were happy to get the 246,000 square-foot lease with Kaye Scholer completed at 250 West 55th Street. And by the way, we also completed our first retail deal with TD Bank at the corner of 8th and 54th Street. So now, the remaining space at the building is located at the top, and we have floors 25 to 38. Floors are about 24,000 square feet each, and our leasing strategy is to go after tenants looking for a single floor or more but under 75,000 square feet. We can deliver space immediately for tenants that are looking for occupancy as early as the very end of 2013.","While leasing velocity at the upper end of the market still continues to be slow, we've had some good successes there as well, including at 399 Park Avenue where we leased virtually the entire 150,000 square-foot block of space that came available on July 31, 2012, in 6 months. We have one 5,000 square foot suite left, and we just completed the suite -- a deal on a suite next door in excess of $100 a square foot.","So just to give you a little bit of perspective on the high end market, though. In 2008, there were 105 leases that were signed over $100 a square foot. That dropped to 17 and 19 in 2009 and 2010 and it moved up to 44 leases in 2011 and 2012. It was basically a flat year with 41 similar transactions. And the average high end relocations -- so as we talk about 510 Madison, we're looking for obviously tenants that are prepared to move, those relocations averaged about 6,000 square feet. So it clearly suggested that our strategy of looking to do these prebuilt suites is the right strategy. We did 4 more in our prebuilt portfolio this quarter, so 510 Madison now stands at 56% leased, and I'll be the first to admit it's slower than we would like and we're disappointed with it. But we do have 2 more floors in active discussions and we are making headway.","Overall, New York City Midtown leasing really is, I describe it as sort of stuck in neutral. There's availability of around 12% and the challenge is there's just not much in the way of visibility on major users with any growth objectives. I guess the one nice thing that's come out recently is that as Sony sell their building and the building is converted into a non-office use likely, Sony will be looking for somewhere under 400,000 square feet, but a good block of space as they relocate from 550 Madison. But essentially, large block leasing in New York City really at the moment is a game of musical chairs and efficiency.","So as we head into 2013, as we think about investments, our activities continue to be focused on our core markets. In addition to our Transbay development in terms of stuff that we are working on that we haven't announced, we are working on an additional San Francisco CBD development opportunity. We're in discussions on another site in northern Virginia that can support both office and\/or mixed-use, mixed high-rise residential very close to our existing portfolio in Reston and we are also working with Delaware North in Boston to advance the North Station 1 million plus square foot mixed-use development. That could be retail, it could be office, it could be residential, it could be hotel.","So that's sort of what our \"pipeline\" looks like on the development and new investment side, and we continue to obviously look at all the transactions that are \"going to be marketed for sale.\" On the other side, we also have looked at our portfolio and, in fact, we expect that this year, we will be doing some selective market sales beginning in early part of '13 and that could approach somewhere in excess of $1 billion. So that's sort of our view on investments on the going-in and the going-out side.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike and he'll talk about our earnings, and then we will bring it up -- open it up for questions.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody, and happy new year. I just -- I want to start by adding to what Doug touched on a little bit with our development pipeline, because we've had great success. I mean, we continue to grow the pipeline. Last quarter, we added 680 Folsom Street in San Francisco, it's 85% pre-leased. As Doug mentioned, we just added another -- we just started another building in our joint venture at Annapolis Junction business park. And with the addition of 601 Mass Avenue in DC, which is 79% pre-leased, and we expect to start in the second quarter, our pipeline would grow to $2.1 billion of total investment. That is nearly 70% pre-leased delivering between now and 2015. We have approximately $850 million of equity remaining to fund on these projects.","So although we have significant cash balances of $1 billion at quarter end, we have highly productive uses for the cash over the next couple of years. We also have $600 million of debt that comes due in 2013, most of it in the second quarter, with an average cap interest rate in excess of 6%. Given our funding requirements, we anticipate that we'll tap the capital markets sometime in the first half of the year to at a minimum refinance our expiring debt. The debt markets have continued to strengthen in the past few months, and despite an increase in Treasury rates, credit spreads have compressed and our potential borrowing costs have remained relatively steady. We believe we could issue 10-year bonds today in the 3.25% to 3.5% area, and we could also access the longer-term market with 30-year or perpetual money available in the high 4% to mid-5% range.","The mortgage market is also very competitive. Life insurance companies, banks and CMBS issuers are all active in the markets. We expect to refinance our 540 Madison Avenue joint venture, where we have a $120 million, 5.2% mortgage expiring in July. With 10-year mortgages available in the 3.5% to 4% range and floating-rate bank loans in the LIBOR-plus 200 basis point area, we expect to reduce our borrowing cost for this mortgage significantly.","We've not issued new equity under our aftermarket equity program over the last 2 quarters, and we still have $300 million available to issue in the program. Our leverage today is in line with our target operating range. Though as Doug touched on, we're also considering selective asset sales as an equity raising tool to maintain balance as we grow our investment program.","In November, we increased our dividend by 18% to an annual rate of $2.60 per share. The increase is designed to keep pace with anticipated growth in our taxable income. In 2012, our taxable income was $2.37 per share. And as we've discussed before, we expect it to increase in 2013.","As we noted in our press release, the servicer for our Montvale Center loan failed to properly complete its foreclosure. And as a result, we've restored Montvale Center on our balance sheet, we reversed the $15.8 million gain on sale we recorded in the first quarter 2012. Now the gain is noncash and it is excluded from our FFO. We expect to record it in 2013 when the sale is ultimately approved.","So turning to our earnings for the quarter. Last night, we reported funds from operations of $1.27 per share, which is $0.04 per share or about $7 million above the midpoint of our guidance. In the portfolio, our revenues were up about $1 million. A portion of this was related to termination income. We negotiated 2 full floor early terminations this quarter, 1 in Reston and 1 at the Hancock Tower to make room for expanding tenants. This has a dampening effect on our 2013 cash rents due to the free rent provided during buildout for the tenant expansions. These transactions that totaled 58,000 square feet both result in longer-term lease commitments and higher rents.","We also had $2 million in net operating expense savings. About 1\/2 of the savings were in real estate taxes as we've started to finalize our fiscal 2013 property assessments with various municipalities. Some of the new assessments were below our projections, but they still reflect an increase over the prior year. The remaining savings were mostly driven by lower utilities expense.","Our 2012 same-store performance ended up the year basically flat on a GAAP basis and down less than 0.5% on a cash basis. Now given the significant role over that we dealt with, including Embarcadero Center and Gateway, 111 Huntington Avenue, 399 Park Avenue and the Patriots Park vacancy that NGA left, we were thrilled to have successfully exceeded our result projections. in The fourth quarter, the same-store portfolio was up 1.7% on a GAAP basis and 2.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the improvement as some of the transitionary downtime is behind us; our development and management services income came in about $1 million ahead of our projections due to higher than anticipated service-related income; and our G&A expense for the quarter was about $2 million below our budget. Over $1 million of this was from higher capitalized wages due to the productivity of our leasing teams this quarter.","As Doug mentioned, we signed over 2 million square feet of new leases this quarter resulting in capitalization of a higher-than-normal percentage of our leasing personal time.  The remaining variance to our budget was in our interest income line, where the interest income on our $1 billion of cash and from our mezzanine loans to our value fund were about $1 million above our budget.","Looking forward to 2013, our portfolio projections remain generally in line with our comments last quarter. Several of the leases that Doug mentioned that impact 2013 were included in our prior 2013 guidance range, although clarity around timing was a little less certain. These include a floor-and-a-half of deals at 100 Federal Street, a 50,000 square-foot lease with a biotech firm for a vacant space in suburban Boston and the 2 significant deals in Princeton, including renewing and expanding Covance in 244,000 square feet and that 78,000 square-foot lease for vacant space with Otsuka. We also signed a 180,000 square-foot GSA lease at Patriots Park and Reston with rent to commence in April. The only real variance to our model in these deals is higher straight-line rent in 2013.","Our current portfolio occupancy is 91.4% and we project improvement through 2013 averaging between 92% and 93%. The majority of our improvement for picking up -- the majority of our opportunity for picking up occupancy is in the suburban markets in Boston, in San Jose and in Princeton, but we also have meaningful blocks of space at 510 Madison and 540 Madison Avenue in New York City and Embarcadero Center 4.","Our 2013 lease rollover exposure is relatively low. We have less than 2 million square feet expiring, which is about 4.5% of the portfolio.","In the same-store portfolio, we project growth in our NOI from the improvement in occupancy, combined with the full year of our 2012 leasing success in Cambridge, Embarcadero Center and at 399 Park Avenue. We project our 2013 GAAP NOI growth of 1.5% to 2.5% over 2012, which is in line with our guidance last quarter. On a cash basis, our growth over 2012 is even higher, as much of our more significant 2012 leasing contained free rent periods that will burn off during 2013. In addition, the free rent period for MFS in 305,000 square feet at 111 Huntington and for Bechtel in 220,000 square feet at Reston Overlook both ended in December 2012. We project our 2013 cash same-store NOI to increase by 5.5% to 6.5% from 2012. Now this is 50 basis points less than our guidance last quarter for a couple of reasons: first, our fourth quarter portfolio results were ahead of our budget, so the starting point for the year-to-year comparison is higher; also, we have 3 situations where tenants have elected to take a portion of their rent -- their lease concession in the form of free rent. This results in higher-than-projected straight-line rent and lower cash rent but is neutral to our FAD due to the leasing cost being lower. Lastly, we had the 2 full-floor terminations I spoke of earlier that reduced our cash rents but increased straight-line rent during the new tenant's build-out. So as a result, we expect an increase from our prior projection in noncash straight-line rent at fair value rent, now projecting $50 million to $60 million in 2013.","The contribution from our development deliveries in 2013 is in line with our prior guidance. The delivery of 500 North Capitol Street last quarter, Patriots Park 2 in May and both 17 Cambridge Center and the Cambridge connector in July constitutes $211 million in total investment, with a weighted average stabilized annual return that is in excess of 10%. In aggregate, these developments are currently 94% leased.","The projection for our hotel is in line with last quarter. It's expected to generate 2013 NOI of $10 million to $11 million. And in our joint venture portfolio, our near-term opportunity is in the 10,000 retail space, and we're also having preliminary discussions with several office tenants at the GM Building for early renewals and potential expansions. We project the contribution of our NOI from our joint venture portfolio to be $115 million to $120 million in 2013, which is a modest increase from our guidance last quarter.","In the development of management services income, our 2013 contribution is expected to be $26 million to $30 million, which is about $1 million higher than our projection last quarter. And in our G&A line, we've refined our 2013 budgets and reduced our expense production slightly to $82 million to $84 million for the year. Our interest expense projection assumes that we refinance our 2013 debt maturities at expiration with 10-year financing at market rates. We've reduced our interest expense projection due to the anticipated capitalization of interest on our 601 Mass Avenue project. So our projection for 2013 net interest expense is now $385 million to $392 million. Capitalized interest is projected to be $58 million to $65 million. Now our estimate could be impacted by changes in any timing or amount of financing we may complete.","So to summarize, we're modifying our guidance range for 2013 funds from operation to $5.06 to $5.18 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the low end and $0.03 per share at the high end, reflecting the successful leasing activity we have achieved in the past quarter, the projected improvement in services income and lower interest expense and G&A. We haven't incorporated any additional acquisition disposition or development activity in the projections. For the first quarter, we project FFO of $1.19 to $1.21 per share. Now the first quarter is projected to be down from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to the seasonality of our hotel and the first quarter G&A, which is typically higher, as it includes some accelerated vesting and payroll tax expense.","So that completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open up the lines for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Josh Attie from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Given the value that was paid for the Sony building, as you look at your own portfolio, does it change how you think about, how some of the space might be used at the GM Building or any of the other buildings as leases come up if there could be alternatives to office space?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","This is Mort. Really, no. We do have some space in that building, as you may know, that is used for retail. But beyond that, no, the answer is no. We haven't changed our attitude to that building. The Sony building is an interesting sort of experience, not only in terms of the price and the price per square foot but as you point out, the possibility, the real possibility that they will be introducing a hotel use into that building. And that was possible in that building because of the floor sizes, et cetera, et cetera, but that doesn't work at all for the General Motor Building, which we are intending to maintain as the most preeminent office building in New York City.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just maybe hit on the potential dispositions that you're teeing up and what the nature of these assets might look like. Is this a function of markets? Or is it a function of assets that may not be as easy to refit to sort of meet sort of modern standards of density, et cetera?","Douglas T. Linde","I would describe the review that we are doing as not either of those. The tack that we're taking is, are there assets in our portfolio where the cash flow characteristics of the building may be such that there are investors in the buildings who value the buildings in a way that would allow us to redeploy our capital into other assets in a more meaningful -- with a more meaningful contribution, i.e. a higher overall return in the future? So these -- some of these buildings are buildings that you might consider -- think of as core buildings. Some of these buildings are buildings that are on the periphery but where we don't think there's much in the way of additional growth but where there's really strong cash flow. So it's really -- it's much more asset-specific than sort of conceptual, Jordan, in terms of how we're approaching them.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess sticking with sort of the modernization or the identification theme. You went through sort of some of the things you may look to do to your portfolio over time and some of the things you're currently doing to make your buildings more attractive to tenants in the market. I'm kind of curious if you've sort of thought about what the cost is on a CapEx basis conceptually to sort of fit out buildings, which is obviously not necessarily a TI but almost a building improvement just across the portfolio.","Douglas T. Linde","So there's no easy answer to that. The answer lies in what we're going to do -- what we're doing with a particular building. And interestingly enough, in some cases, we believe that we can actually achieve revenue from the improvement. In other cases, we think it will improve the velocity and the overall revenue that we can get from the rest of the space. We have generally been spending somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 to $2 depending upon the year on our assets with these types of improvements. When we purchase an asset, we generally build in the capital in a more meaningful way. So as an example, at Bay Colony, we said to the world, \"Look, we're buying this building, these buildings, for $180 a square foot.\" And we expect we're going to put in between $25 and $30 a square foot or $25 million in redoing all of the common areas and changing the configuration of these buildings to create the types of environments that I'm describing. So in some of these assets, it's sort of part of our plan when we buy it. In other cases, as an example, in Embarcadero Center, we've got 3 million square feet of office space, and I would expect that we're going to be spending somewhere in the -- close to $1 a square foot on that type of an experience change in the retail over the next year or so. And it's -- and so it's that magnitude. Sometimes, we're able to find vendors who are prepared to put the money in. So in some cases, we're working with AT&T and Verizon buildings where they have strong needs for helping their own portfolio to put in these GAAP services. And instead of us having to invest $4 million or $5 million, the service provider is investing the $4 million or $5 million. But we're negotiating and setting it up in a way where we can take advantage of what they want to do, as well as inform our tenants and prepare our tenants for the opportunities there and get them to sort of be our partners in these types of transactions. So it's very much varying.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Last quick one. You mentioned Princeton, and you highlighted it being 88% leased. Any particular driver you would highlight? And you think that's going to continue in '13?","Douglas T. Linde","So the vast majority of the leasing has been in the biotech life science industry. They are the cluster of companies that still believe in the New Jersey area from either a drug development or from a marketing perspective. The growth there has been significant, so -- and for the most part, they've been foreign pharmaceutical companies that -- in our portfolio that have expanded. And we're optimistic that we're going to see more of that.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes. This is Mort, and I just want to add one thing to it that we are thinking about in terms of buildings. And that is, if we find a way to provide the infrastructure of technology, that almost every tenant is going to be needing, so that every tenant doesn't have to put it in but connect in to our central facility there. I think that would not only add value to the building, and it would make it much more attractive to a lot of smaller tenants who don't want to get into the cost of putting in a major connection to any kind of online network. So that's something, I think, that is going to be a part of almost every building, major office building, in the country over time, and I think people are going to be putting that in. One of the things that we've looked at, for example, is a global service in terms of the technology of just a visual connection with other parts of the world so that whether they'd be board meetings or private conversations, that this is a technology that is available in some of our buildings. And I think that's something that we're going to be looking at fairly carefully, really, in terms of adding to the value of buildings over time -- our theory always being that we've got buildings that should be enhanced over time even though that we think that they are very, very good buildings today.","Operator","Your next question is from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a couple of questions on the Transbay Tower, and I know it's early days for that. But we've heard from some of our affiliates from the ground that the proposal may not cater to tech tenants as much as some nearby developments. Have you guys -- how far along is that relative to the specific tenant mix that you're targeting for that asset?","Douglas T. Linde","Ray, do you want to take that one?","Raymond A. Ritchey","So Bob and I are sitting here in San Francisco and focusing just on that. We're looking at the base of Transbay to be not only conducive to traditional office users but specifically attractive to the tech tenants that are dominating demand for space. Many of the same dynamics that attract tech tenants are attracting the same professional tenants. And what we're looking at, is aside from the building's strategic importance of the location -- it's at the transportation hub of the city that provides tremendous access down to the employee base in the Valley -- we're designing these floor plates to have really good base spans, column-free. We have a clear height, slab to slabs of over 14 feet. We're positioning this building not only to be the #1 building for professional users but the tech tenants as well. We see also the possibility of putting that building within a building. So if a major user, tech user comes, we could lease them the base with a separate arrival experience, separate elevator cores and then put traditional office space on top. So we're looking at both sides of the market. We're exceedingly optimistic about it. We think it's going to be the defining building in San Francisco for many generations to come, and we're exceedingly confident about the development.","Robert E. Pester","I might add that we recently received a request for proposal for 300,000 feet from one of the major tech tenants in the marketplace. So I think that's an answer to your question, whether or not it appeals to tech.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. I think you guys know I'm a little bit biased here to your architect selection. But do you think -- Ray, do you think that some of those amenities that you're adding are raising construction costs potentially or a typical office building of that size? And sort of secondarily, is there any impact to the square foot per user ratio, sort of a reversal of some of the recent trends that we've seen relative to consolidation?","Raymond A. Ritchey","No, just to the contrary, I think the amenities we're adding will be more than offset by higher rental rates and quicker absorption and longer retention of our tenants. So no, I don't -- I see everything as a positive. Again, we like -- we really like our basis in the property. We love the location and the lack of any really competing supply. The other thing that really has us excited about Transbay is, we're going to be delivering this in probably the best swing of lease expirations in the last 10 or 15 years of the city. We have, Bob, what, between 4 million and 6 million square feet, rolling over in the '15 through '17 time frame?","Robert E. Pester","Approximately 3.5 million to 5 million.","Raymond A. Ritchey","3.5 million to 5 million square feet. And all these tenants follow the same pattern we're seeing in all of our markets where these existing tenants want to get a chance to move to a new building and restack. We think we're going to be in the ideal position to harvest a lot of that demand in that time frame.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. My last question, and maybe I missed this, but I understand that you guys might be pursuing some expanded retail space at 100 Federal. Are there any definitive plans around that or are these not true?","Douglas T. Linde","No, they're -- well, we've -- we're the ones who -- when we bought the building, we said we're going to try and figure out a way to reuse the concourse and the plaza level of the building. And so we are in the process of our design charrette and our tenant investigation and our discussions with the Boston Redevelopment Authority. And so we expect something will happen during 2013 to advance those discussions. And hopefully, we'll be under construction towards the end of the year, early '14, and delivering something in '14 for the customer and for the whole financial district to enjoy and benefit from.","Bryan J. Koop","This is Bryan Koop. We're -- as we speak, we have a team working on this. And the thing that we're going to be very sensitive to is the security needs of Bank of America in this building because this plaza at one time was very, very active place in downtown Boston, and we think that, that demand is still there with its proximity to Post Office Square. So as Doug mentioned, we're working on this. We're going to be talking with the BRA about how we can do this, but the potential is, we think, really tremendous. And then the support from the community, the downtown community, has really been outstanding, and we've also received some good demand and early interest from people that would like to participate in it.","Operator","The question is from John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","John Guinee here. More sort of a big picture question. Sequestration, largely silent in the Wall Street Journal, but it's on Page 1 of the Washington Post. How do you think it plays out? And how does that affect various markets in which you operate?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I think it is -- some portion of that is going to get through the Congress. It will not be reversed by the Congress, let me put it that way, because that's already a law, so to speak. This is not in the same category as the debt ceiling, which would have had a whole other level of complications for the federal government. So I think some portion of this sequestration will, in fact, be put in place. Now, obviously, it's not going to be a positive for the economy in the short term. But the real question now is, sooner or later, the extent of our deficits and the debts that we are accumulating is going to become an increasingly large -- a larger consideration in the way people evaluate the economy of the future. And the future is not going to be that far away. We're talking 3 or 4 or 5 years. So I think that one way or another, there's going to have to be some program to address the accumulation of debts and the deficits that we have. Let me just put it this way, the -- if you look at the projection of where our fiscal policies are bringing us, at some point, the only thing the government is going to be able to afford is the interest on the debt, and it will not be able to afford any other programs. Now, of course, that's just an unrealistic outcome, but it does say that -- it suggests that there's going to be some pressure to do something about reducing expenditures and increasing taxes. If interest rates go up by 1% at this stage of the game, it adds $150 billion to the debt, the annual debt of the government. So we are in an unsustainable and an unattainable situation in fiscal terms. So I do believe that the easiest one politically for the Republicans to deal with is the sequestration. They've got to show the country to justify their whole political approach that they're doing something about reducing the annual deficits and, therefore the national debt. So I think in some form or another, a substantial portion of that will get through, and then we'll just have to see what happens, whether or not there can be any kind of constructive dialogue between the Republicans in the house and the Democrats and the Administration and in the Senate. And I don't believe anything on that level is going to look -- is going to be serious until we see what happens with the Senate election next year, and then you'll see who controls the Senate. And I think that's the next stage of what's going to happen. The Democrats and the Obama Administration are going to make a huge effort to see that they can at least reduce the Republican majority in the house because that's the thing -- that is the body that's going to be blocking their own programs. But at this stage of the game, we've done nothing at all to deal with the debts or the deficits. Now you can argue that -- there is an argument that there's good reason for that given how weak the economy is. So I will just reiterate 2 obvious things. We have the most stimulative fiscal policies in our history, in which we are adding at this stage of the game $1,300,000,000,000 to our national debt or $25 billion a week and have a monetary policy that's putting $85 billion a month of new money into the economy according to the Federal Reserve Board -- Bank itself. So we are in a situation with the most stimulative fiscal and monetary policy, and yet our economy is growing, if it's growing at all, in the weakest terms that we've had. And so everybody is looking at very, very difficult choices to try and resolve these issues that we are now in the midst of. And we're going to see, but I don't think that the sequestration portion of it is just going to be reversed.","Operator","The question is from Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Doug or Mike, when I take a look at the '14 expirations, the big chunk is like 860,000 square feet in Boston CBD. Is that all in Pru Center in Hancock?","Douglas T. Linde","It's almost all in the base of the Hancock Tower.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And so the $45 rents that are expiring, what is sort of current market for that type of space these days?","Douglas T. Linde","It's -- at the base of the building, it's probably right around there. And as you move up the building, it gets higher and higher.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then for 2013, what do you think portfolio-wide is shaping up to be the biggest leasing challenge? Is it the space at 250, 510? Is it some of the stuff in the suburbs?","Douglas T. Linde","I would say that -- I use the word challenge differently. I'd say our biggest opportunity is to increase the leasing that we have at 510 Madison Avenue and 540 Madison Avenue because those 2 things on a revenue basis will be the most accretive to our earnings because of the rents that we're targeting there. And then, clearly, the next is sort of -- what we do in 2013 to impact 2014 with 250 West 55th Street. So that's clearly the largest hole we have with an opportunity we have to dramatically increase our revenue.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Mike, did I hear you correctly that the $1 billion of dispositions that Doug talked about is not in the current guidance?","Michael E. LaBelle","That is correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. Can you guys talk a little bit about the acquisition opportunities out there and any change in your view of kind of after the first of the year?","Douglas T. Linde","So I would describe the acquisition environment as similar to what it was in 2012. There are a reasonable number of assets on an individual basis that are being sold across the markets that we operate in. We are being exceedingly selective about what we're spending our time really chasing because of the issues associated with what we perceive as the advantages and disadvantages of the types of buildings that are being sold. The Equity Office properties portfolio appears to be leaking into the market in modest pieces, not as a large consolidated portfolio. So as an example, they are selling a couple of assets in suburban Boston at the moment without sort of saying, \"Well, we're just selling the entire Boston area portfolio.\" And similarly, I believe they're selling some smaller pieces of their portfolio in Northern Virginia -- Northern California. So we think it's sort of going to be a lot of the same. A lot of the really large transactions that were being discussed in 2012 in places like Manhattan never seem to get to the finish line, and I think largely, that was due to a difficulty in the leasing characteristics of those buildings matched up with an opportunity for tenants -- for landlords to really take advantage of some of the financing alternatives that were out there, particularly in the CMBS market. So that may put a little bit of a governor on the activity level for asset sales if, in fact, the financing markets continue to be as intriguing to owners of assets as they currently were in 2012. But I think it's going to sort of be more of the same this year.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then any update on your -- the GM JV potential sale that's in the market or marketing process?","Douglas T. Linde","So we're -- obviously, we're not marketing that interest. We -- as I've described to people, we're interested to see how it all shapes up. If we have the opportunity to work with a new partner, we're happy to do that. If they're unable to achieve the pricing that they're looking for, we'll certainly take another look at the valuations of the building to determine whether or not we want to increase our exposure to those assets. We love our position in the buildings. We -- as a 60% owner and with significant opportunities on the control side, it feels really good about how we can operate the buildings and what we can do with regards to repositioning and retenanting and putting capital into the buildings. So we're encouraging our partners to take their time and find somebody who would be interested in being a partner with us, and we hope it is a productive relationship.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is there a deadline for the marketing period?","Douglas T. Linde","Like I said, Jamie, we're not marketing the property, so I can't tell you that.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, Mike, can you just tell us what your new guidance will be for AFFO?","Michael E. LaBelle","Sure. I'll go through some of the pieces on some of the big kind of capital costs. I mean, we talked about the leasing and what our occupancy is expected to be. So in order to achieve our occupancy numbers, the leasing in the portfolio has to be about 2.5 million square feet of leasing approximately, maybe a little bit more. So at our average leasing costs, our typical average leasing costs, that's about $100 million of leasing transaction cost that would be incurred. Also, on the noncash rent side, we've got about $50 million of noncash rents that are in the JV portfolio. And I talked about the $50 million to $60 million of straight-line rents and fair value rents in the same-store portfolio. So that's another $100-million-plus that comes out. Doug mentioned the CapEx -- our recurring CapEx, somewhere between $30 million and $40 million. We have nonrecurring CapEx that Doug talked about as well that is tied to our acquisitions and is underwritten in our acquisitions, and we don't typically include that in our FAD because it's underwritten in our acquisitions. And then you've got some things that go the other way like the noncash interest expense and the noncash compensation and the noncash ground rents that we have that kind of total somewhere around $50 million. So if you kind of lump all that stuff together, it's probably -- it's adjustments of somewhere $190 million to $200 million off of our FFO. So you're somewhere around $4 per share, plus or minus $0.10 on either side.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Nussbaum from URS (sic) [UBS].","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mort, can you comment at all for your shareholders on -- if there's really any thought whatsoever going into whether or not you might run for Mayor of New York?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","That's very funny. I don't know. I was quoted in The New York Times on this subject. And I said if there was such a thing as an appointed Mayor of New York, I'd consider it, but otherwise, no. There's no chance that I will run for the mayoralty of New York. And I'm going to interpret your question positively on the assumption that you think I could contribute more as the Mayor than I could in any other capacity. But, no, there's no way that I'm going to do that. That's it.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere, but I'll move on.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes. The joke is running for the mayoralty.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you guys talk broadly about where you see the real estate transaction markets over the next year or 2 in terms of cap rates, in the context of what your view of longer-term interest rates are over the next year or 2, as well as the flow of institutional equity capital we're seeing into the real estate sector, particularly the increasing amount that we're seeing from sovereigns?","Douglas T. Linde","So are you asking if we think cap rates are going to go up or down? Is that what you're asking?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, more for less.","Douglas T. Linde","So I would tell you that I'm not entirely sure where cap rates are. I think that if you sort of had to pick a number, you would say that for high-quality, well-leased institutional New York City CBD, San Francisco CBD, Boston CBD, the cap rates are somewhere in the high-4s to mid-5s, okay? That's where our expectations of sort of where things are -- have been priced are. And I don't -- I never feel comfortable talking about what people's overall return expectations are because I think, quite frankly, that's more important than what the initial capitalization rate is on the asset when it's sold. But when we look at what people are paying for assets and what their expectations are for the changes in rental rates, if they're looking to take leasing risk over the foreseeable future, then I think that their overall return expectations are somewhere in the 6% to 7% range at best. If they are looking to capture growth in rents over a prolonged period of time, in other words, they're buying buildings where, basically, they don't have much in the way of rollover, our expectation is they are looking for a similar overall rental rate. But their growth required in order to achieve -- excuse me, a similar overall return rate. But the growth necessary to achieve that return is probably a lot higher than what they're baking into those returns when they're buying buildings with vacancy or lease expiration issues associated with them. Because what we have found and I think what is fair to say is that the transaction costs and the time it is taking to lease up space in 9 out of 10 cases is more than what is sort of written into or projected in the analytics of people who are buying buildings because of the situations that we're seeing from an overall supply and from a efficiency perspective in many of the markets that we are operating in. So I don't think that's going to change much. The capital flows continue to be reasonably interesting from all of the sovereign wealth types of institutions, but I think there are fewer of those transactions that are being done than people expect. The interest is there but the ability to sort of put your money -- make a hard deposit and go forward with something, I think, is a little bit stickier. So the frenzy and the activity is driving pricing based upon those people being around, but I'm not sure that they are actively, actually procuring buildings at the end of the day in terms of the winning bid.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Let me just add one thing. I mean, I think this is the obvious thing that the whole market in buildings, the transfer and sale of buildings and the purchase of buildings is to a larger degree than usual dominated by how much capital is available and financing at the rates that are available. And that's what sustains a lot of the values. It's certainly not in most cases the demand for office space which, of course, has been affected by the recession and by the concerns over the future. And only a very few selective buildings are doing relatively well. I think is driven primarily by the cost of capital.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Mike, on the disposition front, I guess, one, is Princeton part of that? And two, would you guys be disposing of stuffs as you would be acquiring? Or through your regular ability to manage taxable gains, you'd be able to manage the dispositions without having to necessarily offset them with 1031 acquisitions?","Douglas T. Linde","Alex, this is Doug. So with regard to Princeton, we don't have any immediate plans to do anything with Princeton other than continue to get the buildings leased up and to make more progress on getting rid of all of our early exposure and creating longer-term leases for the portfolio. With regards to what we do with the capital and how we manage it, it's obviously a question of how big the gain is. Certain of the assets are assets that would have significant gains and we'd have to think real long and hard about the timing associated with those assets and what we have on our pipeline in terms of use of capital. Other buildings that we have may not have as significant gains, and so we may feel more comfortable not worrying about the timing and either be in a position where we have a modest return of capital or we \"figure out a way\" to do a smaller tax-free exchange with the proceeds. But we will think about it. It is a concern and a consideration, but we're going to -- we are going to do some asset sales in 2013.","Michael E. LaBelle","Just to reiterate, Alex, none of that is in our guidance, so we don't have any sales in our guidance. And as we look at our investments and the cash that is going on and the liquidity that is going on in the development pipeline over the next 2 or 3 years, we look at asset sales as a possible -- possibly a good way to help fund a portion of that liquidity and basically raise equity and keep our leverage in shape as we invest in new development. So it's really recycling the capital that we have.","Douglas T. Linde","And I guess I should just add one other thing onto the asset sales. When we say asset sales, selling an interest in an asset is also considered an asset sale. So that's part of our thinking as we think about the larger assets as well.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is if we just again focus on the tech tenants who seem to be quite active, if you look at what happened with Microsoft here in the city, they went for a lower-cost option versus clearly nicer space. If you look in Boston, there seems to be a lot of interest from tech tenants at the base of the financial buildings, which is more cost-effective versus some of their other options. Are we -- are tech tenants just culturally adverse to paying the $80, $90 rents maybe on the East Coast? Or is it just a normal maturation of that sector and ultimately those tenants will get there, it's just we're just sort of at the infancy and eventually these tenants will be taking those sorts of top-paying rent floors?","Douglas T. Linde","I think it would be dangerous to make any sort of generalization associated with how tenants are thinking about what their cost considerations are for space. Interestingly, the tenants that are leasing space in Cambridge today are paying more than they're actually paying in the types of buildings that are available in the Seaport District or at the base of buildings, and there's obviously a lot more tech demand in Cambridge than there is in other places. So those tenants that are not prepared to pay Cambridge rents are considering less-expensive alternatives. In San Francisco, we have found that the tenants that are taking large blocks of space are more interested in finding those blocks of space and are prepared to pay what is necessary to go in those blocks of space. So as an example, I think if you looked at the comps for what someone like salesforce is paying in the various buildings that they have gone into, I don't think they are being shy about the rent they're paying relative to what a traditional office tenant would be paying in those buildings. And they're not just going into the bases of building, they're taking large blocks of space where available. And even in New York City, interestingly enough, the tenants that are looking at some of the spaces below 42nd Street are, in fact, paying a significant premium to be there and to be in those types of buildings versus what they might pay to be in the base of a building on Sixth Avenue or on Third Avenue or even for that matter on Lexington Avenue. So I don't think there is any ability at the moment to sort of generalize as to what the price motivations of technology tenants are. I mean, I'm told that SAP, as an example, is looking at one of the buildings at the Hudson Yards. I consider SAP a technology company. And they're looking to be at the top of the building. So I think it's very much dependent upon the business model of those technology companies, the brand awareness that they're trying to create, the overall location in what they want to produce in terms of an environment for their tenants, presumably for their employees as they move forward, and so you can't really make that much of a generalization.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Okay. Let me add. This is Mort. I want to add one other thing to the way the tech tenants, in particular, look at space. They don't have a lot of separate offices for each of their individual employees. It's much more of a collegial atmosphere in which they have 8, 10, 12 people sharing a larger office space. But what that means is the amount of rentable space per employee is actually quite a bit reduced. So in a sense, that enables them to afford higher rents if it's the kind of building that they really want to be in for one reason, either for location or its access to surrounding amenities or what-have-you. So it's a very, very different kind of culture in a lot of these technology firms compared to the traditional -- well, I mean, in terms of space and in terms of the way they lay out space. But it does from the point of view of those tech companies really present them with opportunities to go into buildings that are in the right locations as far as they are concerned, even if they have to pay a higher rent per square foot because they have much fewer or quite a bit of a reduction in the amount of square feet they have per employee.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Sakwa from ISI Company.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, maybe for you or Ray. Mort's comments about D.C., the sequestration -- obviously don't seem to bode well for the market. But you guys were successful in kind of getting the DOJ to complete that lease. You did the Patriots Park deal. You started a spec building up at Annapolis Junction. I mean, kind of what do we read into those? Are those just very idiosyncratic deals or something about Boston Properties' platform or something broader about the demand?","Douglas T. Linde","So I'll start, and then I'll let Ray finish. I mean, I don't want to be immodest here, but I think our Boston Properties, Washington, D.C. region so grossly outperforms every other major owner of property in that area that we have been able to figure out ways to create a tremendous amount of value even in a negative absorption difficult market. And when you think about the negative absorption in Northern Virginia of 3 million square feet this year and that we were successfully able to lease 720,000 square feet of what were effectively difficult buildings that had to be basically gutted and rebuilt and convince the Department of Defense,  Intelligence Agency and ODNI to go into those buildings. Nothing sort of a terrific execution and being able to figure out a way to lease 2 years before a lease expiration at the Department of Justice and get them to renew for 15 additional years. Again it's nothing short of extraordinary in getting Arnold & Porter to commit to 375,000 square feet of space in a market, where again there's been -- for the first time in a long, long time there was no positive absorption. It's a real accomplishment, and I really do think it's about our team. So with that, I'll let Ray keep going.","Michael E. LaBelle","Ray left to give a speech at a JLL function.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, Doug. Maybe just moving onto Boston. I mean, you talked about the demand you're obviously seeing in Cambridge, some of that seems to be spilling over into downtown Boston. But how does kind of Bay Colony fit into this? You mentioned that things are a little slower than you had liked. Are you able to attract some of that tech demand out there? Or are you really having to kind of pull from the local tenant base?","Douglas T. Linde","So I would say we are attracting tenants that are in suburban 128 right now. We are not pulling tenants from other locations at the moment. Now that has happened in certain instances in other years. But right now as I look at our portfolio of opportunities to do leases, it's really a 128 expansion question. So as an example, I described we're discussing -- we're in negotiations with a 50,000 square foot tenant that is located in Waltham that needs more space. And we're talking to another technology company that is in Waltham and is looking to expand by 50%. And we have 2 other tenants in our portfolio that are expanding by 10,000 square feet and 15,000 square feet. They're looking to look at -- one is looking at Bay Colony and another one is looking at 230 CityPoint. So it's really focused on tenants that are in that market. But I will tell you that the number of biotech and life science companies that are, in fact, in and around 128 in Waltham and Lexington has expanded dramatically over the past 5 years, and they are a big, big driver of demand. It was rumored that Biogen was going to be looking to relocate out of Weston and back into Cambridge. And I think that in a perfect world, that's what they would like to do. I'm not sure they can find enough space in Cambridge to do that. And so we'll see what happens with Biogen. And those types of things are reducing the overall inventory of the market because of expansion, not because of musical chairs.","Bryan J. Koop","This is Bryan Koop. Doug mentioned we had a good year last year. It actually could have been even better. As we went into the third and fourth quarter, there were several large deals that just got put into a -- called a stall, as they reassessed the horizon on the economy. And as we entered this year, we're seeing the ice starting to break in the suburbs and renewed activity. Doug mentioned also that there's a couple of customers out in that market who had space for sublease that have pulled back and have decided to take that off the market. So those couple of things I think bode incredibly well. And along with what Doug mentioned was bio entering this market. The other thing that's really great is when you look at the existing base out there, the tenants out there are in good financial state. They have cash in the coffers and they're just being incredibly thoughtful about their expansion. And I think that's what took place in the third and fourth quarter, so we're encouraged for this year as we kick off.","Douglas T. Linde","So just one last comment on suburban Boston. I talked about this before, but it's just part of the life out there. So what happens in Boston typically is that we create technology companies, and then bigger companies tend to buy those companies and merge them into their existing organizations, which effectively creates available space. So as an example, last year Oracle purchased Phase Forward. And we had a building at 77 Fourth Avenue that was 100% leased to Phase Forward, and they moved all those people to an existing inventory of spaces up in Burlington. And we were about to do a deal with a company called Rocket Software at one of our buildings in Bay Colony for 85,000 square feet. And suddenly, there were sublet spaces available, and they jumped into our building at 77 Fourth Avenue. So there's that dynamic that is sort of continually going on in suburban Boston. So if you looked at the overall amount of inventory that is currently leased, there's actually been some pretty significant growth over the past decade in 128. But we continue to have this organic changing of companies. They get developed by VCs. They become very successful, and then they're sort of zapped up by larger companies, and they get sort of reduced in terms of their total headcounts as the products get merged and some of the employees get moved off.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Follow-up question on Princeton. Doug, the leasing in the quarter was very impressive, as you noted, given the sluggish absorption otherwise in that market. What can you tell us about rental rate and concession pressure in the submarket?","Douglas T. Linde","It's been pretty consistent. Overall rental rates are -- for a full transaction of -- package, which is $35 to $45 a square foot, rental rates are in the mid-30s. If you're doing a deal sort of more on  as-is basis, a very small concession package, the rents are in the high 20s. Operating expenses in that marketplace are somewhere between $11 and $14 depending upon what township you're in.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then switching over to 510 Madison. As you talked about in your prepared comments, progress has been slow, and now you have the increased vacancy at 540. And I just wonder, to what extent are you concerned that demand for upper-end small floor plates in that submarket has been set back, perhaps on more than just a cyclical basis? In other words, is it a case that the tenants are just not there, the demand isn't there? Or is it that there's demand but not at that price point?","Douglas T. Linde","I honestly don't think it's about price. I think it's about the demand. And I think that we're in an environment in the financial services sector, where there's a lot of unease and a lot of questions about sort of where people are going to be and how they're going to be funding themselves. And as I've said when I sort of talked about the statistics, 2007 and 2008, there were over 100 deals of -- in excess of $100 and it dropped to 20 in 2009 and 2010, and then it popped up to sort of 41-ish, 45 in 2012 and -- excuse me, 2011 and 2012. We are seeing lots of activity at 540, as well as at 510 Madison. But when you're leasing space unfortunately in-between 2,000 and 7,000 and 11,000 square foot increments, it just takes a lot of time. And while I think we were hopeful that there were going to be more 1-floor and 2-floor deals when we sort of entered the market and that's how it appeared when we started out, that size transaction has become the exception, not the norm, and so I think it's slower. I will tell you that the level of activity on the high-end side for tenants below 11,000 square feet is significantly higher than those who are looking for 50,000, 60,000, 100,000 square feet. So I think that's where at the moment the market really has fallen off.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sure. Okay. And then finally on the TD Garden tower project, the reported mixed uses here, very extensive significant retail, residential, as well as hotel. And I'm just curious in that particular location, do you perceive a particular natural tenant constituency on the office side? Is it possible given where it's located that some of the spillover in demand from East Cambridge could find its way there? Or do you see it as some other kind of tenant that would be looking at that location?","Douglas T. Linde","So I will tell you that -- so Converse is talking to the owners of a project called Lovejoy Wharf, which is, I don't know, 500 yards closer to the water than the sites that we're talking about at the Garden. And they were looking interestingly in East Cambridge as well as in Boston for a location. So I think that there is some applicability between that particular location and Cambridge, given the closeness and the shortness of the bridges. The issue with that part of the market has traditionally been that the inventory has been pretty old and difficult to sort of get comfortable with if you were a growing, larger tenant. And so as we think about office space there, it's not obvious to us what the market will be in terms of where the demand is. And it's a relatively small market. There's probably 4 million square feet of space in that Garden district of Boston to the west -- to the north of Government Center. And so we're being cautious about how much of the buildings will be office and how much of it will be other uses. But as that environment changes, I think the chances for success become much greater on the office side.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And does your hurdle rate go up on this project, given the extent of the mix use and the nature of the submarket?","Douglas T. Linde","No. I think it might go up for the office side, but the demand that we have been seeing and the Delaware North has been seeing and the interest for the retail users and the restaurant and entertainment side has been significant, and as well as there's an apartment building that is currently being developed by AvalonBay on the far side of the Garden. And you have the former West End buildings that are owned by EQR. And so there's a significant amount of residential demand and inventory right or in and around the Garden already, as well as better infrastructure. And the one thing that I think that you have to recognize is that the changes to the Artery and the improvements on the transfer from the North Station area over to the North End and that plaza and that arcade system that is now there in terms of the public spaces has really been a phenomenal change to that area of the city. So if there were product there, it might be very enticing to certain types of tenants.","Bryan J. Koop","One of the things or a couple of things that are really attractive to the office seekers that we have been speaking in early stages is the transportation here. You've got a train station that supplies the northern and western suburbs, and then also a T stop that was built by Delaware North. So the site is in really fantastic position right now to really fill in the last piece of this neighborhood that is really established on both sides; the West End with a strong residential neighborhood and also the North End. And what we're finding from office clients is that as the rents have gone up in the Seaport and Innovation District, they are increasingly looking at this location. And the big piece that's really important to them is this transportation ability that it's already there and also with parking. We've had comments from several users and also from hotel groups that have come in that they're seeing real similarities between this neighborhood and call it the Meatpacking District and what's taking place in New York City. So we're really encouraged about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Truxillo Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mike, you talked about your refi opportunity coming up this year and the cost of 10-year debt, which seems significantly lower than what you're going to be refi-ing. Because of lower rates on the 30-year and the perpetual, has that enticed you any more to look at that product? Or do you still see the 10-year as a more attractive bucket?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, I think that we look at a combination of things. I mean, we really look at our debt maturity schedule and looking to stretch that out and ladder that out. So when you kind of look at the attractiveness of current coupons today at a longer end, today it's not a bad time to be starting to use that part of the maturity scale. But we're still attracted to doing a 10-year paper as well or maybe an 11-year paper. If you look at our maturity schedule, we still have something in 2023 right now, but 2024 has nothing. So I would say we evaluate all kind of maturities. Unlikely that we will do anything shorter. I would expect in the current rate environment as long as we can go, it's great.","Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And thoughts about signing up for the typical covenants that come with a REIT bond for 30 years, has that changed at all?","Michael E. LaBelle","Again, I think this is something we evaluate, and there's certain other products that you could use that have the ability to modify those covenants or prepay that debt, being like a 30-year baby bond, where you have the ability to call it after 5 or even a perpetual preferred type of instrument that doesn't have covenants at all. And that's something that we're going to think about as we evaluate our debt needs this year and beyond.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","There's no doubt but that the interest rate environment, particularly for the longer-term debt, makes us look much more seriously at the longer-term financing than we have more recently. The market is so remarkable and so attractive that it's inevitable that we're going to be looking at it seriously.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","On the GM Building, you said you'd be happy to take another look, which implies that you already passed. If so, how did you think about that conclusion? One would expect that you'd be the natural buyer, given your cost of capital advantage, the value of 100% stake and also the opportunity to create value at the retail.","Douglas T. Linde","So Michael, we get to create and participate in 60% of the value that we create right now. And we have partners who have a very lofty view of what they think the value of those buildings are. And we felt that we were better served using our capital in other places, being able to get the operating leverage associated with all we're doing at the buildings that are part of that portfolio. And if, in fact, they're unsuccessful at the valuation that they suggested that they would be able to sell their interest at, we'll take another look.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Transbay, the RFP comment was interesting. When might we see you sign an ink release there? How quickly could that happen? Or maybe how long might it take?","Douglas T. Linde","Bob Pester, would you like to answer that question?","Robert E. Pester","Yes. We're still in the very preliminary design phases of this project and just starting to think about construction drawing. So I don't think it's going to be something you're going to see in the next month or 2. The proposal that we have on the table right now actually would be tough for us to make the occupancy based on when they want to occupy. But there is activity out there, looking at the building. And hopefully, we'll have something to announce here in the near future.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And Doug, speaking of San Francisco, can you or Bob provide any more color on the other San Francisco development opportunity that you referenced and maybe just what sort of magnitude?","Douglas T. Linde","It's in excess of a couple hundred million dollars. And it's something that we're working feverishly on, and we hope it happens. If it does, we will be able to do something in the short term as opposed to waiting for a couple more years.","Operator","Your next question is from David Harris from Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Forgive me if I missed this in your prior comments. But the dividend increase, how much of that was driven by the increase in taxable income? And how is that going to play out this year?","Michael E. LaBelle","On the dividend side, our objective with the dividend is to have it be relatively close to what our taxable income is. And our policy has been to raise it when we believe our taxable income is going to increase, and we're basically going to be forced to increase it and put it in a place where we think that it's going to stay at that level for a period of time. So I would suggest that the increase that we have put in is kind of in line with where we expect our taxable income to be in 2013, so we wouldn't expect to be coming back next quarter or the quarter after that and having kind of an every quarter type of an increase. And as we get closer to the end of the year, we're going to be looking at our taxable income projections for 2014 and 2015 and thinking about what that means to what our dividend policy will be going forward at that time.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Let me put the question in another way. Is your taxable income rising faster than your projections of FFO?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll try and answer the question in an off-handed manner. So we expect that our taxable income will continue to go up. We only provide projections for our funds from operation for a year in advance. And so Mike, I think, suggested that we're going to need to look at our taxable income again prior to the end of the year. And for this period of time, I would say that our taxable income is certainly going up higher on a relative basis more than our FFO. But we just can't go out further than that because it would be inappropriate for me to comment at what my FFO growth rate is.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Let me go back then on something else. Did I miss this? Did you throw out a mark-to-market on the portfolio? I think the last quarter, you said it was positive $2 to $3?","Douglas T. Linde","It's about $1 a square foot, slightly above $1 a square foot.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And save me doing the math. What's that in terms of percentage?","Douglas T. Linde","I think our average rent is somewhere in the $50 a square foot.","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes, on 40 million square feet.","Douglas T. Linde","On 40 million square feet.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it was littler. And I think, Mike, you made reference to your flat this year. So there's kind of a wash on the mark-to-market for this year's lease roll.","Michael E. LaBelle","2011 to 2012, our GAAP FFO growth was relatively flat.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","On this year's rent roll, we're kind of flat on the roll.","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes. We're kind of flat on the roll this year, and then it actually grows next year. Next year, when we start to have some of the rolls, like at Hancock that Doug talked about, in '14 and '15, we have some positives.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Forgive me if you went into this detail, maybe I missed it in your prior remarks...","Michael E. LaBelle","This is really consistent with last quarter. Last quarter, Doug had mentioned that it was about $1. He didn't mention $2 to $3. He mentioned it was about $1. And we had talked about it being flat in '13 and growing in '14.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And just remind me, which markets in particular are kind of spread around that flat roll, i.e., which markets are going to be positive, which markets are going to be notably down?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, none of our markets are going to be notably down. If you look at our rollout schedule in our supplemental, you'll be able to see the overall amount of square footage that's rolling over on each market basis. We don't have this in front of us right now. So if you want to call back, Mike would be happy to go through it with you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. I think that's it from Boston. Mort, I don't know if you have anything else you'd like to add. We thank you for your participation, and we'll talk to you again in about 90 days. Mort, anything? Okay. Thanks, everybody.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Hello, it's Mort. I just want to add one thing. I don't want to lose the context of what we're working in, okay? Basically, just again will emphasize, the overall economy, which slipped at 0.1% annual rate, that's the first decline since 2009 in the second quarter, and the consensus estimate was plus 1.5%. Now I -- if you want to call it a 1.5% growth economy, I would also point out that the pace is usually more than double that in the fourth year of a recovery. So the headwinds are really formidable. And I think what we have been able to do in that context is really quite remarkable. And we cannot predict just how this is going to permeate, even the markets that we are in. But it is something that we always think about and it will frankly affect us in terms of what we do, not only on the plus side in terms of leasing but also on the other side, which is in terms of financing, because we think the financial markets are really going to be very attractive for quite a period of time. And the economy is going to remain very weak and there's no way that the Feds are going to do anything other than what they have promised to do, which is to keep interest rate low for at least another couple of years at this stage of the game. So we're looking at a very attractive financing market because of the weakness of the economy and we'll just have to measure how we do in the context of that economy as we go forward. It's something that we have by and large, shall we say -- I don't want to say we have avoided it completely, but we've really been able to avoid the brunt of what it is in terms of the economy. But we will be definitely able to take advantage in longer-term financing what that has produced in the financial markets. So I just wanted to put the weakness of the economy back on the table because it's definitely going to affect everything we're doing.","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. Thanks, everybody.

Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. We are in the midst of a kind of a strange overall economy that is puzzling in terms of where it's going and how strong it'll be. J.P. Morgan Chase came out with a fairly bearish assessment of the economy this year and in future years looking forward. They called it the 1% economy because their projecting the rate of GDP growth over these years will be in the order of 1% or 1.25%. The good news, from our point of view, however, is that in the markets that we are in, we are seeing something a little bit stronger than that. This doesn't mean we aren't affected by the overall mood of the economy, because certainly it is not -- it is uncertain at best and pessimistic at worst. But in the markets that we are in, frankly, we're still finding a good deal of activity, particularly in the projects that we have, a good deal of activity in the buildings that we have. And in the developments that we have, we're still seeing action, all of which we will be covering in this call.","Nevertheless, I think we all have to be aware of an overall economic environment that is not the most positive. There's a great deal of uncertainty in the business community because of the anxiety over the national leadership, I would say, is one dimension of it. But the real thing is that American business, I think, has slowed down and its capital spending. Employment growth has been much weaker than a lot of people expected. GDP growth has been a lot weaker than lot of people expected. So we just don't know for sure where this is going, but there's a lot of uncertainty in it. Nevertheless, as I say, in the markets that we're in, which if I could put it in colloquial terms, these are the 1% of the markets, these are the best markets in the country, at least as far as we know. We're still seeing a fair amount of action and a fair amount tenant demand and a reasonable solidity of the balance of demand and supply. We will be covering this during this call, but in general, I think we are modestly comfortable with where we are, although a little bit anxious about how the overall economy can affect the markets that we are in. So far it's had some effect but nothing to the point where we are kind of discouraged about it.","With that, I will stop and turn it over to my colleagues.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone, this is Owen Thomas. I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, our third quarter performance and capital strategy. But Doug and I want to leave substantial time for Mike this morning, to discuss our 2015 forecast, which, in addition to our earnings, is a primary new information we're communicating to you this quarter. Further as you know, we hosted a well-attended investor conference in Boston on September 23, which involved a very thorough review of all of our current activities and showcased a broad group of our professionals. And I'd I just like to remind everyone that these presentations and a webcast are still available on our website.","So, starting with the environment, Mort touched on this, maybe I'll put a few numbers to Mort's remarks. The U.S. GDP growth snapped back in the second quarter, to about 4.6%. However, most forecasters, today, are forecasting growth to settle in the low 2% range over the next few quarters and for the year 2014. Growth is positive, but it's certainly not robust. The unemployment rate has also improved, marginally, to 5.9%. As we've been describing in prior quarters, economic growth continues to be uneven across our markets, as San Francisco, Boston and parts of New York are experiencing strong growth, driven by technology and other creative tenancy. While more traditional markets like downtown Washington, D.C., which are driven by government, financials and law firms, are experiencing much more difficult leasing conditions.","I'd also like to touch on the recent market volatility. Given recent disappointing global economic growth numbers, particularly in Europe, political unrest in various points around the globe and other factors, the financial markets experienced highly elevated levels of volatility over the last month. And the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has dropped another 20 to 30 basis points to around 2.25%. This increased volatility has not had any impact on our operations or leasing activities. Though perhaps a little early to call, given sales transactions recently announced and discussed, it would appear the real estate capital markets remain active and aggressive. In fact, we believe we could experience even more enhanced asset pricing in the market place given lower interest rates.","Moving to our results for the third quarter, we performed well and made good progress in the execution of our business. As you know, FFO for the third quarter was $1.46 per share, which is $0.09 above consensus forecast, though there are some nonrecurring components that Michael discussed. We completed 89 leases in the third quarter, representing 1.9 million square feet space, with the Boston and New York regions being the largest contributor.","This level of leasing activity, at 1.9 million square feet, is roughly 50% higher than our quarterly averages, and is being driven by new activities as well as early renewals of several significant law firm tenants. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 92% leased, down 1% from the end of the second quarter. However, our occupancy is flat and in line with expectations if you exclude 250 West 55th Street, which was placed in service this quarter. Lastly, we made significant progress executing our assets monetization plan and development pipeline, which I'll discuss in greater detail.","Moving to capital strategy, our capital strategy remains consistent with what we've communicated at our Investor Conference and in prior quarters. Given that prime assets in our core markets are trading at higher prices per square foot and lower yields than where we can develop, we have recently been net sellers of real estate while reinvesting raised capital into new development. The pursuit of acquisitions remains active but challenging. New investments considered today usually have some type of competitive angle for us, such as providing tax protection through the use of operating partnership, even if it's consideration; working with a financial partner or involving properties with a development or redevelopment component where we add value to our expertise.","We made very significant progress in our disposition activities in the third quarter. As you know, in September, we announced the sale, to Norges Bank, of a 45% interest in each of 601 Lexington Avenue in New York and Atlantic Wharf and 100th Federal Street in Boston, for an aggregate sale price of $1.8 billion. The pricing represents a 3.8% cap rate on 2015 NOI, $1,073 per square foot, and a total return on invested capital to Boston Properties of 15.5%. The transaction will raise $1.5 billion in proceeds and is expected to close later this week. Combining this transaction with the Times Square Tower joint venture, we completed last year, we now have our $5.5 billion of assets in joint venture with Norges Bank, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds and most active real estate investors globally. We also completed, this last quarter, the planned sale of Patriots Park in Reston, Virginia, for $321 million, which represents a 5.2% cap rate, $455 a square foot and a total unleveraged return to shareholders of 11.5% over 16 years.","With these 2 transactions along with the sale of 5 additional smaller assets, we will have sold $2.3 billion of real estate in 2014 versus a target of in excess of $1 billion. These 7 transactions were executed at an average cap rate of 4.25% and will raise $1.9 billion in proceeds to be used for investment in our robust development pipeline where we are forecasting initial returns in the 7% range, as well as a to-be-determined special dividend. We do not anticipate any additional significant dispositions in 2014, but we'll consider further sale activity in 2015. Depending, of course, on capital needs and market conditions.","We continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. In the third quarter, we delivered into service 250 West 55th Street in New York, which is 77% leased, and 680 Folsom Street in San Francisco, which is 98% leased. Our active development pipeline now consists of 10 projects representing 3.3 million square feet with a total projected cost of $2.1 billion, down from $3.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our development pipeline is, in the aggregate, 54% pre-leased.","Though no new projects were added to the active pipeline in this past quarter, we continue to be in a pre-development stage on another set of projects with strong potential in all our markets, most significantly our North Station project in Boston. In the aggregate, our share of these project represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.2 billion in gross development cost.","Let me turn it over to Doug for a review of our markets and operating performance.","Douglas T. Linde","Thank you, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I also want to add my thanks to everyone that made the effort to come to Boston and\/or listen to our webcast last month. That conference every 3 years, and our objectives are pretty simple. First, we obviously want to provide you guys with an update on our activities in our market conditions, but what that conference really does is it allows us to showcase the depth of our regional management teams, and it provides you with some visibility on the people who are actually doing all the heavy lifting on a daily basis. And I hope, visually, when you see some of those projects, a.k.a. the things that we did out in Bay Colony or when we took over Cambridge. It really illustrates how we create and protect value. The emphasis was obviously on the Boston region this time, but it's what we do throughout our organization. It really is true that identifying the opportunities and challenges inherent in the individual assets; and creating the right plan to position them; and making speculative capital investments, those are the hard decisions, but it's what we do all the time; and it's our execution that really is key to outperforming the market. So we just hope you came away with a much better understanding how we have developed both our brand and our approach to managing, leasing, developing and when acquire -- acquiring assets.","Given that I provided a pretty up -- rigorous update on the market conditions during the conference, this morning my remarks are going to be focused on the backdrop to Mike's forecast for 2015. So we're seeing another good quarter from an earnings perspective. Corporate America's balance sheets are very strong. When we look at venture capital investing, interestingly, if you look at what happened in the first 3 quarters of 2014, we've already surpassed the annual amount of venture capital investments for the last 10 annual years. So we've done, in 3 quarters, what we have done over the last 10 years on an annual basis. The Silicon Valley, New York City and Boston markets continue to obtain the largest share of those investments, a.k.a. those are the 3 markets that we talk about where there's the most activity and the strongest amount of overall demand growth.","Big picture. Since last month, we really haven't seen any changes in our operating markets. So things still feel pretty good. During the first 3 quarters of '14, we've leased 5.6 million square feet of space, which already exceeds our annual leasing in 8 of the last 9 years. As you can see from our leasing stats that are in the supplemental, we're seeing strong mark-to-market on our recent transactions in San Francisco, Boston and New York, up 37%, 27% and 25%, respectively. While Washington D.C. remains weak, we are making good headway on our near-term lease expirations.","As we begin our view of 2015 versus '14, I thought it would make some sense to provide you some color on the major factors impacting the year-to-year comparison as we experience major rollover in a few key assets and some visibility on where we hope to be when we get through these transactions. These are activities that we have forecasted over the past few quarters. So we'll start in Boston.","At The Prudential Center, we are underway with 888 Boylston Street, and we expect to commence a 14,000 square foot addition to The Prudential retail, as well as a total renovation of The Prudential food court. Beginning in August of 2014, we began to terminate leases in the retail, and year-over-year we anticipate a $3.5 million to $4 million reduction in net operating income from that space. As we reopen the space beginning of early 2016, and finishing by the end of the that year, we expect to create an incremental -- so on top of the $3.5 million to $4 million, an incremental $4 million of annual NOI. At the Hancock Tower, our leases with State Street and Manulife will be expiring at the end of 2014, leaving us with about 414,000 square feet of availability beginning in the early parts of the year. In average, the in-place rent is about $43 per square foot, gross, for a loss of $18 million of NOI on an annual basis from the Hancock Tower in 2015. Our askoobing rent on this remaining block of space range from the low 50s to the mid-70s. So when fully leased, this space should generate annual revenues of about $25 million or a 39% increase. As a reminder, since the acquisition, we've completed more than 700,000 square feet of leases at the Hancock Tower, with an average markup of about 20%. We're also going to be going back 50,000 square feet of space at The Pru tower and another 52,000 square feet from Bank of America at 100 Federal Street. Offsetting this backup space will be the commencement of our 308,000 square foot lease with Blue Cross Blue Shield at 101 Huntington Avenue in April. In May of 2015, they have a staggered start. We also expect Bay Colony to move from 79% occupancy at the end of the year, or today, to about 93% by September of 2015. We don't have any vacancy in Cambridge, but nevertheless, we've already leased another 53,000 square feet of our 2015 expirations and 73,000 square feet of our 2017 expirations, at rents that are almost 25% above the in-place rents, but they're not going to show up at our numbers until the end of '15 and into 2017.","We've been -- foreshadowing early renewals with our law firm clients in New York City. Our transaction with Weil was completed at the end of the third quarter. We will be taking back 3 full floors. The first in December of 2014 and the other 2 in December of 2016, where the current fully-escalated rent is about $90 a square foot. Our asking rent for these floors is over $150 a square foot, and we are in negotiations for the floor expiring at the end of the year. As is typical on a long-term lease commitment, the tenant will receive a period of time to build out the space, which will push revenue recognition into late 2015. Our second transaction is at 599 Lexington Avenue, again, another law firm, and we're going to be taking back 4 floors. We've leased 1 floor already and we'll be providing the bulk of the remaining space to another law firm tenant as free swing space for 12 months beginning January 1, 2015, limiting any revenues for the year. As we've discussed in the past, Citi has exercised their termination right on 173,000 square feet at 601 Lex in 2016. Well, we are already in discussions to lease up to 90,000 square feet of this space, and we're working with Citi on an early termination. This will accelerate the vacancy for 1 or more floors in 2015.","Our newest assets in New York City, 510 Madison and 250 West 55th Street will contribute significant incremental revenue in 2015. 510 Madison is now 91% leased and 250 West 55th Street will see the lease commencement of 2 additional multi-floor tenants in March of 2015. The incremental NOI contribution from these assets will be about $36 million in 2015, based on current executed leases. We currently sit with 195,000 square feet of available space, with asking rents over $90 a square foot at 225 West 55th Street. We expect to finish most of the leasing in '15, but we won't see revenue until the very end of '15 or early 2016.","In Washington, known GSA compression and law firm expirations will have an impact on our occupancy primarily in our joint venture properties. Overall, the D.C. CBD occupancy will end 2014 at about 96% and average 94% during 2015. In Reston, we have an unplanned vacancy due to the bankruptcy of NII Holdings in the Town Center. While they leased a 180,000 square feet, the net exposure, after taking into consideration subtenants and a reduction of their occupancy, will be about 63,000 square feet on January 1. The current rent is about $52 a square foot. We anticipate The Avant, our apartment building, currently 70% leased, should reach it's full stabilization by the end of March, with an incremental year-over-year contribution of about $6 million.","In the Bay Area. 2015 will be very similar to '14 with very limited rollover. We're actively engaged with a host of full floor tenets with 2016 and 2017 lease expirations. Some of these renewals will be with law firms that are shedding modest space, but where we see significant opportunities for rental increases for both the renewal and the recapture space. We expect to end 2014 with about 6% vacancy at EC and to be flat at the end of 2015. The mark-to-market on our EC office portfolio stands at about 20% for all of the leased expiring in 2015 and 2016.","We are close to 100% leased in our Mountain View assets, and with last week's announcement that Google had taken on an additional 2.9 million square feet of space through leases and purchases, we are optimistic with our ability to lease the 437,000 square feet of vacancy at Innovation Place, our Zanker Road project in North San Jose. When leased, this will drive an incremental $12 million of income.","535 Mission has received its certificate of occupancy and truly is expected to occupy their space in the next few weeks. We are in negotiations with other tenants for over 100,000 square feet, which should bring us to 67% leased before the end of calendar year 2014, with lease commencement early 2015. We would expect to achieve revenue on all of the space by June and are optimistic we can lease the bulk of the remaining space at 535, prior to the year end, with full commencement by the middle of 2016.","All of the items I have discussed, however, are dwarfed by the impact of our 2014 sales transactions. Mike's going to discuss the earning impact of those transactions along with the geography of where it all appears in our future earnings. As we sit today, we would anticipate a sizable special dividend. The gain on sale from the sales activities is slightly over a $1 billion, but we are still working through some of the possible 1031 opportunities, and are finding our 2014 taxable income, which should impact the payout. We will be meeting with our board and will provide guidance on the dividend as soon as we have some clarity.","Mike will now go through our results and our '15 guidance.","Michael R. Walsh","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with a quick recap of our performance for the third quarter. As we been guiding you all year, our same-store performance continues to be positive. This quarter was strong, with same-store NOI up 3.8% on a GAAP basis and 5.9% on a cash basis over the third quarter last year. Our same-store occupancy was up about 20 basis points, though much of the better NOI performance came from higher rents and free rent periods burning off. As Doug detailed, we experienced large rent roll-ups in all of our markets this quarter, except D.C. Our lease transaction cost were also a little bit higher this quarter, they totaled about $46 per square foot, which is $6.50 per lease year versus our run rate, over the last few quarters, of about $30 a square foot. This was impacted by the large volume of deals in New York City which are longer-term but also carry higher brokerage cost.","For the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.46 per share, that's $15 million or $0.09 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A big piece of the out-performance was nonrecurring items that totaled about $8 million or $0.05 per share. We received a $7.7 million distribution from the Lehman Brothers estate that related to our pre-financial crisis lease at 399 Park Avenue, which was terminated in bankruptcy and which we classified as termination income. We still have a remaining claim that has a value estimate of around $9 million, though the timing and the likelihood of collection of it is uncertain. We also recorded $1.7 million of termination income at Metropolitan Square in our joint venture portfolio, we negotiated the take-back of a floor from one of our law firms and immediately leased the floor, plus another vacant floor, to a new tenant. And the last item was $1.4 million in transaction costs we booked this quarter, related to our asset sales activity.","The performance of our core operations was higher than our budget by approximately $7 million or $0.04 per share for the quarter. Our portfolio NOI was up $6 million and management services income up just over $1 million. The portfolio performance stems from the sale of Patriots Park, which occurred later than we expected and added $1.3 million, better-than-projected rental income spread across our regions of $1.7 million and lower-than-anticipated operating expenses of about $3 million. We expect half of our expense variance to hit in the fourth quarter, increasing our fourth quarter operating expenses.","As we look at the rest of 2014, there are 2 key changes to our projection that will impact our full year guidance. The first is the impact of the sale to Norges of a 45% interest in 100 Federal Street, Atlantic Wharf and 601 Lexington Avenue. As we discussed at our investor call last -- investor conference last month, we entered into an agreement to sell a joint venture interest in the 3 buildings for $1.8 billion, which equates to a total valuation of $4.06 billion. As Owen mentioned we're on track to close later this week and the lost FFO for 2 months is $10 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, these assets will remain consolidated in our financial results. And the impact to our earnings will be reflected through an increase in noncontrolling interest.","The second item is the anticipated redemption of $550 million of unsecured bonds that are expiring in 2015. We expect to notify the trustee, under our bonded venture, that we intend to redeem the bonds using our make-whole rights. The make-whole provides a 35 basis point discount compared to paying all of the remaining interest payments. This will accelerate the interest expense on the bonds from 2015 into 2014 and add $10 million to our 2014 interest expense projection or $0.06 per share. We now project our full year 2014 net interest expense to be $456 million to $459 million.","The most significant change in our operating portfolio performance relates to our long-term renewal with Weil, Gotshal at the GM building. Weil, who currently occupies 485,000 square feet, is renewing in 390,000 square feet and will give back 3 floors in the upper third of the building. One floor on December 31, 2014, which Doug noted is under letter of intent, although the build-out time will take revenue recognition through to the end of 2015, and 2 floors at the end of the 2016. As you recall, the in-place rents at the GM building are significantly below market, so we will see an uptick in noncash straight line rents immediately, with the increase in cash rent commencing at their natural expiration in 2019. We also will accelerate the existing noncash fair value lease balance into income over the remaining shorter-term for the give-back floors. Particularly, with respect to the floor coming back in 2014, this has a significant impact and our noncash rent for the building will be $5 million higher in 2014 than our prior protection.","We expect our occupancy to remain stable for the rest of 2014, the impact of the Weil renewal and the performance in the third quarter will show up in our 2014 same-store NOI projection. We expect same-store NOI growth of 3% to 3.25% over 2013 on a GAAP basis, which is up 75 basis points from last quarter. On a cash basis, we project 2014 same-store NOI growth up 5.5% to 5.75% over 2013, also better than our projection last quarter. Our noncash rents are projected to be $108 million to $110 million for the full year 2014.","Our other projections for 2014, including for developments coming online, unconsolidated joint ventures, hotel and development and management services income result in no guidance changes from last quarter. We do expect to come in near the low end of our range for G&A expense and now project $100 million to $102 million in G&A expense for the full year 2014.","So in summary, our out-performance in the third quarter of $0.09 per share, combined with improvement in our same-store projections, nearly offsets the loss of $0.06 of FFO from asset sales and $0.06 of higher interest expense from prepaying our 2015 debt maturities. We are tightening our guidance range for 2014 projected FFO to $5.24 to $5.26 per share, and we project fourth quarter funds from operations to be $1.23 per share to $1.25 per share.","This is the time of the year that we start to talk about 2015 and provide formal guidance for 2015. And as you recall, last quarter we discussed a few items that would have a significant impact on next year. These include the dilution from our 2014 asset sales program and transition in our Boston CBD portfolio. Offsetting this is the full year impact of our 2014 development deliveries, which provides significant FFO growth.","The asset sales have the most meaningful impact to 2015. In 2014, we expect to complete dispositions totaling $2.3 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 4.25%. The annualized FFO loss associated with these assets is $84 million or $0.49 per share. Now, a portion of the FFO loss occurs in 2014. So as you think about 2015, the sales will reduce our 2015 funds from operations by $65 million or $0.38 of a per share reduction in FFO year-over-year.","As you think about our same-store guidance for 2015, we anticipate that our overall occupancy will decline early next year, due to the Boston move-outs, to near 90%. But then improve and average between 91% or 92% for the full year. 100 basis point of occupancy in our portfolio was approximately 420,000 square feet. The biggest impact to our 2015 same-store performance is in Boston. Where, as Doug noted, we have 516,000 square feet of expiring leases where we expect vacancy during 2015. Doug also mentioned the impact from the renovation of The Pru Center retail. The loss of occupancy is partially offset by the anticipated positive absorption in the suburban portfolio and also with Blue Cross Blue Shield moving into 300,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue. In total, we project the NOI contribution from the Boston portfolio to be down by between $14 million and $18 million in 2015, which meets our same-store NOI growth in 2015 for the portfolio as a whole. We're projecting NOI growth in New York City, both from gains in occupancy at 250 West 55th Street, 510 Madison Avenue and 540 Madison Avenue, as well as from the roll-up on rental rates on some of our key lease renewal activity.","In San Francisco, we project NOI growth from both occupancy gains and continued strong positive roll-up in our leasing. Given that we are 96% leased in the city and have just 260,000 square feet of leases expiring, our growth opportunities is somewhat limited in 2015. As Doug detailed, we are actively working on several of our 2016 expirations, where we have 900,000 square feet expiring at an average in-place rent of under $50 per square foot.","In Washington D.C., we project losing about 200,000 square feet of average occupancy next year, resulting in lower same-store NOI. The market weakness in D.C. primarily impacts our joint ventures, as much of our D.C. portfolio is in our unconsolidated joint ventures. We also recorded termination income of $1.7 million this quarter at our Met Square joint venture that we do not expect will recur. So the 2015 FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is projected to decline in 2015 and total $22 million to $27 million.","Overall, we project our 2015 same-store NOI, on a GAAP basis, to be relatively flat between negative 1% and positive 0.5% compared to 2014. On a cash basis, we project 2015 same-store NOI growth of between 0.5% and 1.5% over 2014.","As Doug described our pending vacancy in Boston is highly marketable space, and once we re-lease it at market rents, we will see a nice increase in our same-store. In 2014, in our developments, we delivered 250 West 55th Street, 680 Folsom Street and The Avant, each of which has been in lease-up during the year. We're also delivery 535 Mission Street in San Francisco this month and 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, D.C. in the fourth quarter of 2015. These developments have a meaningful impact on our 2015 results, and are projected to add between $50 million and $60 million of incremental NOI to 2015. Our noncash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $80 million to $95 million in 2015, and we project our hotel to generate $12 million to $14 million in NOI in 2015.","We completed a couple of large third-party development fee projects in 2014, including the Broad Center expansion in Cambridge and the George Washington University science center project in D.C. The completion of these jobs is factored into our 2015 projection for development and management services income of $15 million to $20 million for the year. This represents a significant decline in our third-party development fee income from the past few years, and as we illustrated during our investor conference, we have a robust development pipeline and we've been more focused on using resources to deliver our new projects than on third-party fee assignments. We will be generating management fees associated with our Norges joint ventures that are not included in this number. Since these joint ventures will be consolidated on our books, the management fees show up in our earnings through the computation of noncontrolling interests and are not included in fee income.","We project our G&A expense to be relatively flat compared to 2014 and project expense of $100 million to $104 million. With the early redemption of our 2015 bond expiration, that have an average coupon of 5.34%, we anticipate that our interest expense will be lower next year. Given the large cash balances we'll be holding from our asset sales, we are not projecting additional financing in 2015. It's always possible that we may see an opportune window to hit the debt market. But at this point our cash balances are sufficient to fund our forecasted development needs for the next 2 years and we have no additional material debt maturities until the fourth quarter of 2016. Of course, we're constantly looking for new opportunities, including expanding our development pipeline that could accelerate our capital needs.","For 2015, we project our net interest expense to be $415 million to $425 million. We project capitalized interest to be $40 million to $50 million in 2015, which is lower than 2014 due to our stopping capitalized interest associated with our deliveries of 250 West 55th Street and 680 Folsom this year.","If you combine all of our assumptions, we project 2015 funds from operation of $5.22 to $5.42 per share. This represents an increase of $0.07 per share from 2014 FFO, at the midpoint, despite the loss of $0.38 per share of FFO from asset sales. If we had not elected to sell assets in 2014, our projected FFO midpoint would be $5.70 per share, equating to projected FFO growth of nearly 9% over 2014, which is driven primarily by NOI from our development pipeline and lower interest expense.","That completes our formal remarks. I would appreciate if the operator would open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, if you sort of try and look at the quarterly progression of the way earnings are going to unfold -- and I realize it's a little early to even ask about 2016, but how would you kind of guesstimate the quarterly progression of FFO looks? And I guess, what I'm really trying to get to is, where do you think the run rate of the company is at the end of next year kind of positioning you for 2016?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, obviously, it's going to be lower at the beginning. Because that's when we're seeing our significant rollover in Boston, with 400,000 square feet of space. And our occupancy going down from where it is today by about 100 basis points, 150 basis points at the beginning of the year. And then we anticipate that we're going to continue to lease up that space through the year. I don't have the exact quarterly number in front of me but we're going to gain somewhere between 100 and 200 basis points of occupancy on our portfolio, which is -- our same-store portfolio is about 42 million square feet and the supplemental provides what the average rents on that are. Obviously our development, also, will have a significant impact on the growth during the year because a run rate today, on 250, where we got 50% of the occupancy that is revenue commencing. And we're going to get up to 78% based on existing signed leases by the end of the second quarter of 2015. And then we will continue to lease up the remaining 200,000-plus square feet, as Doug mentioned through the year, with the hope that we'll get revenue started on some of that stuff. Some of it is prebuilt during '15. And then there's 535 Mission, which, as well, is -- again, in lease-up, it is going to help us. So if you look at those developments, you will see an increase, through the year, of the contribution from those developments.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. My guess it might just be something you want to think about trying to provide because I think there's a lot of lumpiness here. But it feels like the business is good and it's a timing issue and your exit the year on a much stronger footing.","Michael E. LaBelle","Steve, I think that's a fair characterization. The business feels really good, particularly in Boston and in San Francisco, and in -- honestly, in New York City. Maybe not as much of a rental rate growth with respect to New York City. And we've got really high value-added vacancy that we've known about and we've been forecasting for the past number of quarters. And we will get it leased up and will probably get it up leased up at rents that are higher than what we are currently budgeting. I can't give you a crystal ball on the timing of it. We leased 2.5 million square feet of space in Boston -- or we will have leased 2.5 million square space in Boston calendar year 2014. And I would not be surprised if our leasing folks in Boston were highly successful at getting the 500,000 square feet of high-value space leased by the end of the year. Revenue recognition, different question, right? Is it going to be fourth quarter of '15? Is that going to be third quarter of '16? It's going to depend on the situation.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just the other question, for either you or for Owen maybe. Just as you think about asset sales and pricing in the market place today, how do you guys just think about potentially selling more assets, ala the Norges JV, as you look into 2015? I know you don't put in the guidance, but just kind of what are the drivers as you guys think about. Is it just the unsolicited offers and you make the buy\/sell decision at that point, looking at kind of an un-levered IRR calculation? Or what prompts you to decide to sell those?","Michael E. LaBelle","So, Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we don't anticipate anything further for '14, so your question really relates to '15. We put asset sales into 2 categories. One is assets we consider non-core, those transactions have probably been more in number, but certainly lower in terms of capital raised. And then the other are assets where we've been achieving, we think, pretty interesting pricing relative to the cash flow growth in the asset. So we have not -- and are certainly are not prepared at this point, to give you a forecast for '15, in terms of additional asset sales. But we clearly want to continue to work on our non-core portfolio. We have assets, again, that are non-core to the ongoing business. And to the extent that we can sell some of those for attractive prices similar to some of the deals that we've done in the suburbs, in Boston and in Maryland, over the last year. We're want to do that. And then we're going to continue to assess the capital market for the second category of buildings and our capital needs. Mike talked about the fact that we have a significant amount of capital to address our current pipeline of opportunities for the next 2 years, to the extent new opportunities are identified and there's more of a need for capital, that'll be another factor that we'll consider as we look at this. So I think the second category -- again, it's harder to predict and it'll depend on, again, capital needs and what's going on in the capital market and does this aggressive pricing continue to accelerate in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If you look at the comment that you made in the earnings release on 415 Main Street in that purchase option. Can you just help us think about the dilution aspect of that in 2016? Given the high rents in that building. And I realize some of those related to amortization, but what's going to be sort of the '16 drag?","Michael E. LaBelle","Sure. So, just to give you the history, so the transaction that you're talking about is a building that was once called 7 Cambridge Center, now our marketing folks have decided to call it 415 Main Street. It's a building that was built for the Broad Institute. It is a building that is leased to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of that lease back in 2004, when it was negotiated, they were dogmatic about the need to own this real estate at some point in the future. And so, we entered into an agreement where we would do 2 things. We would amortize all of their costs from the tenant-proven perspective, over the term of the lease, at 8%. And we would give them the right of purchase building at -- basically almost doubling our money over the 10-year period of time. So effectively, we built the building for about $60 million and we're selling it for $106 million. I believe, Mike, correct me if I'm wrong, the rent on the office space was about $31 a square foot. And then rent on the lab, which is effectively the TI loan, was about $29 a square foot. So, net-net, it's about $70 or $60 a square foot that we will be losing in contribution starting in February of 2016. And it's it's a 230,000 square foot building.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then turning back to future dispositions for a second. How much are you weighing the need for capital in doing disposition versus selling an asset because of favorable pricing and then doing something like a special dividend?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, I'll give you the first answer. I think it's pretty clear that we are not, in any way, shape or form, doing things because we are in \"need of capital\". We sit on -- at the end of these sales we'll have $2.5 million of cash and we will have $1 billion under our line and we will also have reduced our debt, significantly, over the last few years. So from a balance sheet perspective, we are highly liquid and have great ability to raise capital.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe I'll rephrase that and say use of capital rather than need for capital.","Owen D. Thomas","No, I think -- it's Owen again. Both are a factor. Again, going back to the question a moment ago, more broadly about asset sales. The first category, the non-core, we want to continue to do that. We think, given the current capital market environment, its an opportunity for us to exit certain non-core assets if we can get appropriate pricing. And I think your question really relates to the second category, which are these larger transactions that we've been executing at what we think are very favorable terms. And we're going weigh both of those factors as we consider additional asset sales. What is the opportunity? What are the cash flow characteristics of the building that we would sell or joint venture and what would our potential capital needs be. And as Doug and Mike have pointed out. Right now, we don't have a significant near-term capital need given the sales activities that we conducted this past year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Your cash re-leasing spreads jumped up pretty significantly in the third quarter. I was just curious if you think that's representative of the kind of spread you'll see in 4Q and 2015 or if you think that was more of a one-off. And maybe just, in general, if you could highlight where your portfolio in-place rents stand relative to market today.","Owen D. Thomas","So I think that the direction that you saw in the third quarter was consistent with the direction that you will see in the fourth quarter and in early 2015. I think, overall, we would anticipate that the mark-to-market on most of our assets in San Francisco and in Boston are in the sort of 20, plus or minus, percent increases. The New York stuff is lumpier. As I have described before, we some of these larger scale re-leasing transactions that we're working on, where the rents are sort of flat. We have a couple of where there's a market increase in the rent, a.k.a. the wild got-you-alls of the world. And then there are a couple that, on a mark-to-market basis, are negative. I mean we have, for example, a couple of the floors that we're taking back this quarter from one of the tenants, the tenant was paying $130 a square foot on, and then the market rent is probably $95 to $100 a square foot. So net-net, New York City is somewhat muted. And so I think, depending upon the timing of those transactions, there'll probably be more variability in the New York City leasing than there will be in the Boston or the stuff that's going on in San Francisco. And then Washington, D.C., it's really interesting. The funny thing about Washington D.C. is it's not all in the leasing spreads. The rents, net-net, are not going down. They're not going up a lot but they're not going down. So you have 2 factors. You have the fact that Washington, D.C. leases traditionally have 1.5%, 2.5%, 2.75% annual escalations. So a rent was, at one point, $35 or $36 a square footage suddenly in the mid-40s, and the rent today is probably in the low 40s. So there is, potentially, a little bit of a muted impact on that. And then, where the weakness is really translated in Washington D.C. is on the concession packages. A new transaction in Washington, D.C., for our major law firm over 100,000 square feet, you're talking in excess of $100 worth of tenant improvement money and you're probably talking about 9 to 12 months of free rent. And those 2 things don't get factored into the rental rate. And so it gets somewhat muted there.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And you guys had talked, at the Investor Day, about an interesting New York City development opportunity, potentially in an area outside the midtown. Just wondering if there is an updates to share on that.","Owen D. Thomas","It's still really interesting and it's still outside of midtown and it's, unfortunately, not at the point where it's something we can talk about publicly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm hoping you could talk a little bit about leasing progress at Salesforce Tower and just your latest thoughts on San Francisco.","Owen D. Thomas","Sure. Bob Pester, do you want to take that one?","Robert E. Pester","Sure. We are making several presentations in the last couple of weeks. They range from anywhere from 1 floor to a user up to 250,000 square feet. We think the activity is very good, based on the status of the project right now, where we are just digging the hole. And we're optimistic that we will continue to lease space during the course of construction. Whether or not we'll have most of it leased or just some of at leased at completion remains to be seen. But we're very optimistic on the activity.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And have you seen any change in demand or change in sentiment given some of the earning issues we've seen from some of the tech companies the last couple of weeks?","Owen D. Thomas","No, not at all. Not at all. In fact if you look, Uber, Yelp, several of the large tenants that have been in the market continued to take space. I mean, Uber just took another 80,000 square feet on top of the 400,000 that they announced last month. So we're very optimistic as far as the activity that we're seeing.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess a question for Mike. I don't know if you know the numbers or run the numbers. But if you were to back out the Boston transitional vacancy, do you know what your same-store would look like next year?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, I mean as I -- the same-store is about $1.4 billion. So we're losing $14 million to $18 million. So it's a 1% rough difference to 1.5% rough difference if that was not there. And then as Doug mentioned, you lease it up to the market, right, you're going to add another 40%. So another $8 million or something like that to that income. I would add, just to your question on San Francisco, it's interesting on some of the tech company earnings announcements. Most of them are expense related because they plan on hiring more people. I think that bodes, actually, well for San Francisco.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then one last question. Hotel multi family same-store was down year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there?","Michael E. LaBelle","I think the hotel was up a little bit. It had better rate than we anticipated. And the residential market was primarily due to The Avenue, which, from 2013 to 2014, has seen a reduction in the rental rate that we can get. And you can see in the supplemental, it'll show you what the rates are from period to period. And that's really what's driving that decline.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you see that turning?","Michael E. LaBelle","I think that our projections are that it's going to be stable in 2015. We're not projecting significant decline. But there's a lot of product that has come online in that marketplace.","Owen D. Thomas","Jamie, I mean, we are far from expert at where the Washington, D.C. market is with 1 property. I think our view, based upon our conversations with the folks who are doing the leasing, are that rates going to basically remain firm and we, hopefully, will pick up some occupancy. I'd say our occupancy went down more than we would have been anticipated during the move-out or around the end of the school year at G.W. And so we've done some things to sort of change the approach how we deal with that transition. And there is basically a total net-net neutral decision on where we're pricing the unit. But we are not a good barometer of the residential market in Washington, D.C. If you call in a half hour I'll probably do a better job for you there.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of questions on concessions and leasing commissions for the quarter. They bumped up. Is that really a function of the mix or is there 1 specific lease, that you might have done, that was the driver of those numbers?","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes, it is clear mix. It's, a, we did longer deals. And so, clearly, with a longer lease you have a higher commission. And then there's a majority of deals that were weighted towards New York City. And the New York City Leasing Commission has given that the New York City rents are also higher, pushing the number significantly.","Robert E. Pester","Several of those deals in New York City were 20-year leases. So they have a pretty significant impact.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Given the fact there's increasing pricing power across most of your markets. When do you think we can start to expect to see some of those absolute numbers start to tick down?","Michael E. LaBelle","I think that, net-net, we are not seeing a lot of pushback on concessions in any of the markets that we operate in. Because there is still a bid for either new construction or there are landlords who are prepared to provide additional concessions with a higher rent. So there's been less pressure on that. Interestingly, in San Francisco, most of the transactions, from a concession perspective, are not too dissimilar from where they were 2 or 3 years ago, but the rents are 25% higher.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question, I'm not sure who wants to answer this. But given the sort of reversal of the 10-year, RMG has moved up pretty substantially, indicative of a readthrough to further compression in cap rates. I guess, number one, are you seeing any evidence of that or is it too soon? And number two, are you underwriting even tighter cap rates in most of your markets for future transactions?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, it's Owen. There was a transaction announced in Washington, D.C. this week, the PNC Plaza, and it was an all-time record of 1,000, I think 1,075 -- if Ray is on, he could confirm -- 1,075 a square foot. So that is some tangible evidence, to us, that we have this volatile period and the market is continuing to move forward. And anecdotally, given that we're in the marketplace, we hear about other deals that are continuing to progress at pretty aggressive numbers. So I don't think it -- David, I don't think it necessarily changes our underwriting. But as I said in my remarks, on the acquisitions side, we're focused on deals where we have some kind of unique angle to Boston Properties. Whether it be using our partnership units or something that's got a value-added component. I guess, the good news is that maybe we sold the portfolio to Norges too cheap, but we retain 55% of it, so it should come through on our NAV right?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted a follow up just a little bit on San Francisco. I think it was mentioned in prepared remarks that VC funding was very high this year, higher first three quarters than it had been the past few years. And then I think you also mentioned that part of the improved leasing activity was the companies that are expanding their hiring expectations. Are you guys seeing any change in terms of tenants taking down growth space, such that the leasing that's occurring there now, has got a little bit more shadow space or growth space baked into it than what we've seen so far this cycle?","Michael E. LaBelle","So let me answer the question in the following manner. Traditionally, in San Francisco, post the dotcom meltdown, technology companies had the luxury of being able to basically do just-in-time demand for their real estate offerings. So if they needed 50,000 square feet of space, they wait until 6 months before they needed it. They hire the people and the they would lease -- the space would be plentiful and it would be there. And I would say that was the situation that you were seeing in San Francisco until about 2 years ago. And 2 years ago, everyone sort of woke up at the same time and said, there are not a lot of blocks of suites available. And so technology companies, the Salesforces of the world, the Dropboxes of the world, the Ubers of the world, the LinkedIns of the world, the Googles of the world, all said, if we're going to be able to continue to grow, we have to be become more corporate and long ranging in our views on how we go about acquiring sites and making sure that we have the real estate facilities necessary to allow our growth and our new employees and existing employees to move into, as we sort of get there. So I would tell you that there is absolutely no question that a lot of what is going on today are tenants that are taking down space in expectation of growing their organizations. But these are all organizations, and Mike has, ad nauseam, talked about this in the past, that have tremendous operating fundamentals that have clear profitability indicators in either EBITDA or cash flow growth or top line revenue growth. And so you can see the logic behind their need for additional employees, juxtaposing it to, back in 2000, 1999, when there were a tremendous number of non-publicly traded or publicly traded and recently funded organizations that were based upon a business plan without any revenues, without any income, without any sort of track record. And it all sort of suddenly fell into the ocean in 2001. It's a really different kind of a class of customers that are doing what I'm describing. And I think that's what changing. But it is absolutely true that they are looking at real estate a couple of years before they need it because they don't have a choice, at this point, other than to do that.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Just one other just kind of follow-up question. Mike LaBelle, just on a very high level basis, it sort of seems like 2015, as you've highlighted, is a transition year from a same-store growth perspective. Is it kind of similar to, I think, what was 2012 or that appeared like it was a bit of a transition year. And then you posted very strong growth last year and this year on a same-store basis. Is that sort of how we should think about the years, maybe the couple of years after '15, that you're kind of priming the pump pretty good same-store growth thereafter?","Michael E. LaBelle","I will agree with you that I think there's a good opportunity for us to have faster same-store growth beyond 2015, assuming that we are successful in leasing up the space that we have in Boston, which again is at The Pru Tower and the Hancock Tower and The Pru shops, which we're going to see strong growth on. And then if you look at San Francisco, and you look at 250,000 square feet EC expiring to the end of '15. But the 900,000 square feet expiring during 2016 at rates of under $50 a square foot, we should be able to lease that space today in the mid-60s to 70. So again, to the extent that we're successful in being able to kind of renew those and lease-up any space we get back, which I think we should be, we should see some benefit from both of those. So I do think that we are well-positioned heading into 2016 given that dynamic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the likelihood of potential 1031 Exchange and maybe if you could dovetail into that some of the opportunities you are seeing on the investment front and whether or not it's possible to potentially 1031 into development?","Michael E. LaBelle","Okay. Let's see, I'll let Owen describe sort of the pipeline of things that we're looking at. Conceptually, it is virtually impossible to 1031 into development in a meaningful way because the dollars to be put out the door within 6 months. And the fact of the matter is you have to do it on a property by property basis and there's just not enough capital on a current basis going out in any of these assets to make a meaningful dent on that.","Owen D. Thomas","And then on the new investment opportunities, I would put them in a couple of different categories. Although I think probably the most significant category is looking at new developments, so particularly new sites. So if you look at markets, particularly I would say in San Francisco and in New York City, we have a number of projects that we're actively working on, where we would acquire a new site and it would be a new development. We do look at the acquisition of existing assets in all of our markets. We're very active in that. But as we've talked about, from a pricing perspective, we've had a very difficult time making the figures work for those kinds of acquisition. So, again, going back. I think the focus for us to be competitive in this market is, is there a development or redevelopment angle, where we can our development and operating expertise to create value or is it something where there is a tax protection we can provide through our unit. That would be another category of things that we'd be looking at.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just following up on on-development, as a look at San Francisco and there have been a number of questions surrounding sort of the strength and how long it will continue. What's sort of the appetite to invest incrementally in new development there given the existing exposure to Salesforce Tower et all?","Douglas T. Linde","I think it's a very fair question, Jordan, and that the good news is that, from a timing perspective, none of the things that we are currently looking at are \"likely this sort of cycle development,\" in other words they're not going to be started in the next 6 months and be competing with the completion of Salesforce Tower, which is going to occur in the first quarter of 2017, knock on wood. So that most of them are -- as everyone knows, there's been a lot of talk about Prop M and the inability for the city, at the moment, to approve new development much more than what has currently been discussed, which is another a couple of million square feet, which is already sort of \"spoken for\". Most of that the stuff, the things that we're looking at, are projects that will be a 3- to 4-year permitting exercise. Working with the city, getting in line, doing what's necessary to procure the rights and get our Prop M allocation, and then be in a position to start the development at that point. So net-net, given our current exposure, I think I would hope and expect that our current exposure will have been long put to bed prior to the commencement of these other developments. So maybe we will get involved in something else in the interim. That's sort of in the process because it make sense for us from a capital perspective and there's an opportunity that we see. But most of the things that we're working on really have a more longer timeframe associated with it, which really will not be competitive with the Salesforce Tower.","Owen D. Thomas","And just one thing I would add to what Doug said. If you think about our portfolio -- and we talked about this a lot, the investor conference, in Boston, and to some extent Washington, particularly in Reston, we have somewhat of an embedded long-term development pipeline. Because we have sites on our existing assets. We have the North Station project, which you're going to be hearing more and more about. Whereas in New York and San Francisco, we don't. And so that deals that Doug is describing is really setting is up for continued longer-term development investment in those 2 markets.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","This is Mort. Let me make a comment about the Salesforce Tower, because that building is being leased, 50% of it's being leased, but it's the bottom 50%. The upper 50% is unique in San Francisco. There's just going to be nothing like it. So I think it's just going to have an unusually strong competitive position, no matter what other buildings come on stream in the San Francisco market. We're talking about the tallest building, by far, in San Francisco. And we're looking at the top 40 floors, give or take a little bit. And those floors are going to have unparalleled views and will have an identity that will be just remarkable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions for me. The first question is -- if you could just comment on the dialogue with tenants, especially the bigger tenants -- are you seeing the tenants engage proactively in lease negotiations earlier, trying to get a jump on playing off the, whether its development or availability of space or are you seeing landlords being ever more proactive, reaching out for tenants sooner, to try and ensure that tenants don't even get a whiff of what else may be out there?","Michael E. LaBelle","So obviously, it depends upon the size of the tenant. I would tell you that -- and I'll let John Powers chime in here, I would tell you that almost every major tenant, and if you define a major tenant as more than a couple of hundred thousand square feet, is very sophisticated about what's going on in the market place as are we. And so it is a natural conversation for an organization to be having with it's landlord or for it's landlord to be engaging with its customer about what its long-term opportunities might be, how it might be able to reuse and reutilize its space more efficiently and what the choices might be in its existing portfolio versus going outside the portfolio and looking at -- either subsidize new development, which is what the issue is and in the case of a place like New York City, with the Hudson Yards and the step down in the World Trade Center area or new just sites that has been permitted and where building potentially available in a market like Washington D.C. But John, do you want to comment on that?","John Francis Powers","Well, I think you're 100% right. But I add on to that, depends upon the situation of the tenant and their business. Are they long space, like Weil was? Are they short space? Do they need additional space today? Is their business -- need to be reconfigured? So we can do have a look at the macro conditions in the market that Doug spoke about. But every tenant has its own deal and its own story and its own structure, specially if they're more than 150,000 feet.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is for Mike LaBelle. As you guys contemplate -- right now, you spoke of not needing to recycle any capital. You guys are sufficiently funded. But when you, presumably, get around to the next round of potential asset sales or JVs, as far as JVs goes, how much of an impact is it with regards to the rating agencies, as to which assets you choose versus you've ample capacity regardless, within the rating covenants, that you can be looking at unencumbered assets to JV just as easily as encumbered assets to JV?","Michael E. LaBelle","We have plenty of room and we had specific conversations with the rating agencies around the Norges joint venture because a couple of these assets are unencumbered. And our expectations, in the near term, is they will remain unencumbered. We do, however, have rights to encumber these assets, up to certain levels that are fully within our rights, and our partner is fine with that. So, to the extent that there was a situation where we wanted to encumber them to improve our pool, we could do that. However, in our conversations with the rating agencies, there's not a lot of concern from them related to that issue. There are many other companies that also have JVs like this, that have strong ratings. And my view is that it has minimal, if any, impact on where our rating is today.","Operator","And your final question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe, first, just an update on traditional versus nontraditional tenants in Manhattan. In recent quarters you've referred to the traditional tenants in Midtown, and downtown D.C. for that matter, being weaker as the economy continued to slowly improve. Do you feeling any sort of strength emerging or is it's still largely limited to tech and the less traditional verticals?","Owen D. Thomas","John, do you want to cover that?","John Francis Powers","Well, tech is strong in New York. It has been -- clearly that's the case, but that's a small percentage of the market. The high-end financials are doing well and I think the law firms are rightsizing. In our portfolio we've talked about looking with -- I've mentioned we're dealing with 7 law firms, Weil was -- it took less space, but some of them are expanding. So I think that the traditional sector is doing well. Tech Is doing very well. And I think there's a lot of interest, now, in moving to the future. People are looking at solving their business needs and getting their business situation correct, looking longer term. I think that's a lot of interest in Hudson Yards and also Brookfield's project. A big tenant looking at that. So I think the New York market is in more in a growth mode overall. But certainly, tech is the hottest.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on 535 Mission, it's coming on in about 1 year. Could you provide a progress update on the pre-leasing strategy? It doesn't look like anyone signed on during the quarter. So how are you balancing the desire to quickly fill the building versus holding out for potentially stronger rents down the road?","Owen D. Thomas","So 535 Mission actually got it's TCO a week ago. And the first tenant will be in occupancy, and working in the space, within the next couple of weeks. We have signed our second lease at the top of the building this quarter -- I mean, in the fourth quarter in October. And we are close to execution on another lease that will bring us to about 65% committed and leased. And we expect the remaining portion of the building to be leased before the end of calendar year 2015, with rent commencement either in '15 or by no later than the middle of 2016. And we are we have seen about a 15% increase in rents from the first transaction that we did, which was probably negotiated 8 months ago, to the rents that we are asking today.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And last question. I appreciate that you can't forecast 2015 asset sales right now because there are some unknowns. But if, for example, market liquidity remains similar to today's environment and given that you don't need capital, would you be encouraged to sell core assets just based on market pricing versus the fundamental outlook? I'm trying to get a feel for just how attractive the pricing is right now in your mind.","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, Vance, as I mentioned, we have non-core assets that we're going to continue to sell, subject to the pricing that we're able to receive for those assets. And then on the second category, which is more return-oriented, we're going to have to weigh those factors as we get in 2015. What's the pricing for the asset? What are the assets? What's the structure? What our capital needs? And it'll be a confluence of all those factors.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional remarks.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay. Let me just conclude by reminding everyone that we had a strong quarter financially, and hopefully we've been able to demonstrate that we continue to make terrific progress executing our plan. And thank you for all your attention and we'll see you all in 2 days. That's right, down at Atlanta, yes.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our Regional Management teams will be available to address any questions.","And I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter of performance and are successfully executing on our strategy for continued revenue and income growth. Highlights for this quarter include, we grew our FFO per share 15% over the first quarter of 2018, which was also $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter and $0.06 above street consensus.","We raised our full-year 2019 FFO per share guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint, which would result in a 11% FFO growth above 2018. We completed one 1.5 million square feet of leasing for in-service properties, which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period and we increased the occupancy for our in-service office and retail portfolio 150 basis points from the last quarter to 92.9%. this also marked 240 basis point increase from a year ago. Also this past month, we completed an early renewal and expansion of our lease with Bank of America at a 100 Federal Street in Boston for 545,000 square feet.","We obtained construction financing for the Marriott headquarters development on favorable terms, and we issued our 2018 sustainability report and were selected as a 2019 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year, the highest recognition possible from the EPA for distinguished corporate energy management programs.","Moving to the economy. Overall economic conditions continue to be stable and overall favorable for Boston Properties. Initial U.S. GDP growth estimates for the first quarter were 3.2% will surpass in prior estimates. Job creation remains steady with 540,000 jobs created in the first quarter and unemployment continues to be low at 3.8%. The Fed has turned accommodative, as indicated, it will not raise interest rates for the foreseeable future and intends to pause quantitative tightening by year-end. As a result, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has been steady so far this year dropping around 20 basis points to 2.5%. This economic landscape is not exclusively rosy with GDP growth in Europe and China declining and prospects for escalating trade tension.","In our business, we\u2019re experiencing confidence and fundamentally strong leasing activity with our customers and our core markets. With the exception of the Washington DC\u2019s Central Business District. Rents continue to escalate markedly in Boston and San Francisco, driven by strong demand and minimal new supply. Given this backdrop and the broader set of economic signals, we do not anticipate a near-term economic correction.","That said, we continue to keep our aggregate debt levels low and ensure our developments are appropriately pre-leased before launch. As we know, an economic turn is inevitable and difficult to precisely predict. So as a result, we are well positioned to take advantage of ongoing economic growth and to whether a contraction with durable cash flows.","The private real estate market for our assets and our core markets remained strong and liquid. In terms of the data, significant office transaction volume ended the first quarter at $17.5 billion, down 31% from the fourth quarter of last year and down 21% from first quarter of 2018. The volumes are lower; anecdotally, we are finding our pursuit of new investments to be highly competitive both for buildings and sites. Animal spirits seem alive and well as financing costs are lower than 2018 and most investors are not overly concerned about a near-term production.","Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. Starting in the Boston, Financial District, 75 State Street is under agreement to be recapitalized for $635 million, which is $755 a square foot and a 4.4% cap rate. This is an 840,000 square foot property. It\u2019s 98% leased and it\u2019s being recapitalized with a joint venture of offshore capital and fund managers.","In New York, a 38-story, 1.5 million square foot single tenant office condo at 30 Hudson Yards sold for $2.2 billion or $1,500 a square foot and a 5% stabilized cap rate. The condominium interest is 100% leased to Time Warner for 15 more years and was sold to a developer fund manager backed by institutional investors.","In San Francisco, a 49% interest in 200 Howard Street, better known as the Park Tower building is under agreement to sell at an imputed value of $1.1 billion or $1,445 of square foot and a low to mid-4% cap rate. The recently constructed building is 762,000 square feet is fully leased and is being sold to a developer fund manager backed by Sovereign Wealth Fund.","And finally, in West LA, Wilshire Courtyard is under agreement to sell for $625 million or $627 a foot and a cap rate of 2.5% although that is artificially low, because the assets not stabilized. The building comprises just under a million feet in a 60% leased and being sold to a North American developer investor.","So, moving to our capital activities. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders and our pipeline of current and future developments remains robust. Our current development pipeline stands at 11 office and residential developments, and redevelopments comprising 5.3 million square feet and $2.7 billion of investment for our share. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.6 billion of total capital remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7%.","In 2019, we expect to commence 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, which is a 469,000 square foot Class A office building located in the Central Business District of Washington DC. The building is 66% pre-leased and will be an estimated $360 million investment. We will also start the redevelopment of 325 Main Street, in Kendall Center in Cambridge following the long-term lease agreement we signed with Google this past quarter.","The current 115,000 square foot building will be demolished and replaced with a new 400,000 square foot office tower, the office component of which will be fully occupied by Google. As part of the agreement, Google will extend their current leases for an additional 15 years and two of our other buildings in Kendall Center comprising 450,000 square feet. As a result, we will have an over 800,000 square foot long-term relationship with Google at Kendall Center.","Total project cost is $450 million plus the value of the existing building. As part of the local zoning, we are required to develop a residential building of at least 200,000 square feet at Kendall Center with 25% of the units reserved as affordable. The office project will commence in 2019 and the residential project is currently moving through its design approval process.","In San Jose, we are completing predevelopment work for our recently completed land investment at Platform 16. We have made presentations to multiple potential large users and are in discussions with a capital partner to invest with us in the project. On dispositions, we are targeting approximately $300 million in asset sales this year. We recently entered a binding agreement to sell One Tower Center, a 410,000 square foot office building located in East Brunswick, New Jersey for $38 million. The property is 39% leased and in a challenging location far from the stronger demand dynamics we experience in Princeton at Carnegie Center. So, this decision is in line with our strategy of disposing select non-core assets.","Although the sale resulted in an impairment charge, there\u2019s no substantial loss of income and our companywide portfolio occupancy will increase by approximately 50 basis points. We also put on the market this quarter 540 Madison Avenue located in Midtown Manhattan. Our 40% joint-venture partners in this 284,000 square foot asset wanted to sell their interest. After reviewing expected sale outcomes with our advisor and understanding a sale of 100% interest in the property would likely yield better pricing. We decided it was in the best interest of our shareholders to sell our position as well. The marketing process is underway and there has been substantial interest in the asset to date from prospective buyers.","Lastly, we have recently been asked by many of you about the ramifications and potential cost to landlords of the Climate Mobilization Act passed by the New York City Council last month. The goal of the bill is to reduce city carbon emissions 40% by 2030, and 80% by 2050. Boston Properties supports greenhouse gas reduction policies, has already established its own public greenhouse gas reduction targets and has actually reduced the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our buildings by 39% over the last 10 years through investments in new energy efficient systems and utilizing more sustainable energy supplies. Details of all this are available in our annual sustainability report, which we released last month.","We started down this important road many years ago given the business case for investment in energy efficiency, the contribution of the built environment to global emissions and \u2013 and in anticipation of local regulations such as the recently passed Climate Mobilization Act in New York that will likely continue to strengthen over time in our other core markets.","Specifically, related to New York, we think our portfolio already substantially meets the 2024 emission targets set by the new regulations and have plenty of time to make additional enhancements, probably by acquiring more sustainable energy sources by 2030 when the second phase of emission targets take effect. Given our shared mission on climate with our communities and our leadership role in sustainability, we hope to work cooperatively with New York and our other city partners to create logical and effective legislation to accomplish reduced greenhouse gas emissions.","So, in conclusion, Boston properties is off to a strong start in 2019. We completed another quarter of successful execution with 15% year-over-year FFO per share growth. We increased full-year guidance for 2019 to 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Economic conditions remain favorable. Tenant demand remains strong. And we continue to lay the foundation for continued company growth beyond 2019. As I look at Boston Properties today, I\u2019m delighted with our progress. We continue to outperform our sector in terms of FFO growth with an attractive pipeline of pre-leased development, healthy same-store NOI growth, a new and refreshed portfolio and modest leverage with capacity to support additional investments.","Let me turn over the call to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen, and good morning everybody. So, we are seeing the constructive macro environment that Owen described in his remarks really reflected in the actions of our customers, our tenants. When I dissect the activity that we\u2019re seeing in Boston, CBD, the Cambridge markets, suburban Boston, San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, LA, it\u2019s really driven by the growth from the technology and the life science and media, financial services and professional services firms that are that make up the demand markets.","In midtown Manhattan, we have service providers like law firms that are continuing to expand, although the rebuilding of more efficient spaces moderated their growth somewhat and the successful financial firms are growing while the challenging results from hedge funds have created some space reductions in that market as well.","In Northern Virginia, there are a number of tech titans that I\u2019ve identified, the DC metro employment base as a fertile area for incremental expansion, Amazon aside and the increase in defense spending has led to expansion by those organizations that service that sector of the government or homeland security. It\u2019s the supply that is regulating whether a market or submarket is strong and landlord favorable or week and tenant friendly. In the office business, where we have long leases, our average lease length today is over seven years. Spot market conditions don\u2019t immediately show up in our results.","Last quarter, I described Salesforce Tower, where we signed our first lease in April of 2014, we achieve our fully occupied run rate in October of 2019 and based on the last few deals done in inferior building, some rents about 40% below market today. This quarter, we signed our lease with Google to build the new 325 Main Street. We started that least negotiation in 2017 along with the extension for 450,000 square feet that Owen described. And the cash contractual extension rent increase on that 450,000 square feet, which commences in 2025, is 27% higher and because rents have moved so quickly, that number in 25 is 25% below today\u2019s market rent.","Let\u2019s talk about the markets. Our expectations in what\u2019s going on in our portfolio. I\u2019ll begin with Boston. Over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve heard me describe the extraordinary demand, which Boston and Cambridge have seen along with a very limited supply pipeline. The new buildings being delivered are not two million square foot towers, but rather 400,000 to 500,000 square foot mid-rise buildings, they have all found either pre-releases or pre-delivery lead tenants with a very little aggregate speculative space.","Existing inventory is full and contiguous full floors are hard to find. In our portfolio, this is led to tenant inspired early renewals. Last week, we completed a 545,000 square foot, 15-year lease extension with BOA at 100 Federal Street starting in 2022. The net rent is increasing by more than 37%.","At 200 Clarendon Street, we\u2019ve completed 45,000 square feet of early renewal and our documenting another 89,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2022 with an average increase of over 30% on a net basis. In the realm of no good deed goes unpunished, because we\u2019re going from gross to net leases at 200 Clarendon Street, it\u2019s actually going to result, believe it or not, in a reduction in our short-term GAAP income until the new lease structure is kicking in 2022.","In addition to our Google transaction in Cambridge with no available direct space in our portfolio, we were still able to complete a 35,000 square foot \u2013 feet of additional 2022 tenant requested extensions and here, the increase is only a 100% on a net basis. You should know to large decline in our occupancy at 325 Main Street. We terminated all of the retail leases, 47,000 square feet this quarter and we will complete the vacation of the building total loss of about $4 million per year on an annualized basis by the end of the second quarter, and this will impact our results in 2019, 2020 and 2021.","Given the increased demand by life science tenants in Greater Boston, we\u2019re converting a number of buildings from straight office to office lab used in our suburban portfolio.","The first such building lease was signed this quarter at 33 Hayden Avenue in Lexington, because of previous investments by the vacating tenant. We\u2019re only investing about $35 a square foot in base building upgrades and the net rent is moving up by 86%. We intend to convert 200 West Street in Waltham to a similar facility. You\u2019ll see a drop in occupancy as we vacate 50% of this building to enable the lab conversion. In this case, we\u2019re investing about a $130 per square foot on the apical square footage and we\u2019ll have a similar pickup in rent expectation. Lab rents are about $50 triple net in the Waltham, Lexington market. We expected double-digit incremental return on the incremental investment, and as we permanent design all of our new suburban products, it is being positioned as lab ready. 180 City Point, our next development site in Waltham is a 300,000 square foot building that fits this bill.","We did have a few leasing disappointments during the quarter involving our development assets. We had a lease out for execution canceled for the remainder of our 100 Causeway Tower when the customer was sold in an M&A transaction and we had a life science company ready to sign 50,000 square feet at 20 City Point and its product had a disappointing trial and so that lease was canceled as well. We expect, we will replace these tenants with higher rents and lower concessions, rents in Boston and Cambridge and Waltham, Lexington have great increases in 2018 along with the decline of concessions and we expect the same in 2019.","In New York City, we made a lot of news last quarter with our leasing transactions at 399 park. The New York City leasing dynamics have not changed in the last 90 days. All the known deliveries in the far west side are happening. We haven\u2019t seen rents suddenly increased and we haven\u2019t seen concessions change. Our portfolio focus today is at the General Motors building and our 97,000 square foot block of available space at 399 Park Avenue.","At the moment, we have one high-rise floor available at GM 40,000 square feet, but by the end of the first quarter of 2020, we\u2019ll have an \u2013 we have additional known move out of about 170,000 square feet. This space contributes about $13 million for 2019. Combining this, 210,000 square feet with the 97,000 square feet that\u2019s available at 399 Park Avenue. This portfolio of space should ultimately contribute revenue of about $27 million as we sign leases and commence revenue in 2020 and 2021, more than 50% of the space will be leased under $105 a square foot and the rest should demand rent in excess of $130 a square foot.","The financial markets in the latter part of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 were not kind to the hedge fund community, which along with private equity shops and boutique financial advisors; make up a significant portion of the high-end demand in this market, rents in excess of $127 a square foot. As I\u2019ve described previously, the leasing in this Manhattan submarket is not about the incremental price or concession package. It\u2019s simply a matter of a smaller demand pool and at the moment, that segment of demand is somewhat light.","Construction at Dock 72 is progressing. We expect rework will be open by September 1 and we expect to open the amenity space by early October. Tenant interest is picking up and we received our first full floor proposal from a technology company last week. The fairy should be operational in May and we will be able to begin to showcase what dock 72 has to offer. It\u2019s a pretty great tour and you should all go over and take a look. You should note that we have extended our stabilization projection to the third quarter of 21 and this, along with some base building costs, increases has resulted in the increase in the project budget that you see in our supplemental information.","The challenging supply conditions along with the more challenging demand pool in the Washington DC CBD market continued to pressure at the spot leasing market there. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s 150,000 square foot law firm with an expiration prior to 2023 active in the market. The GSA has very aggressive pricing requirements all about eliminating their ability to lease higher quality available space. There were significant new availability and the competition is fierce from more granual near-term demand. In the CBD, the flexible office providers continue to be a positive as that segment of the market continues to absorb medium space blocks of space and they are truly aggregating demand that we would never accommodate. While face rent on leases are stable, it\u2019s all about concessions and more importantly, rent commencement dates. The good news is that we are reasonably well at least in the district with modest near-term exposure and we have sold down our position significantly over the last few years.","Almost 10% of the company NOI resonated from northern Virginia, where the demand picture is much more robust. We have known future availability in 2020 approaching 500,000 square feet with the biggest block stemming from our delivery to Leidos in March of 2020 and the departure of tenant, whose growth we will not be \u2013 we could not accommodate in 2017 and 2018. We are in active discussions with two existing tenants that are looking to expand their 50,000 square foot installations, three new tenants looking for a minimum of 75,000 square feet each in a number of 7,000 to 10,000 square foot users that are focused on this amenity rich environment. While the Reston Town Center ecosystem will win the day for many of these users, there will be some interruption in income as we retained at the space, the 2020 reduction in revenue from the known expirations, there\u2019s about $17 million.","Moving west, in LA, while Colorado Center has 100% leased that we were actively marketing the 140,000 square foot block that HBO will vacate on 12\/31\/20 as well as our 2021 lease expirations. At the Santa Monica Business Park, we are also working about getting ahead of our late 2020 expirations. The West LA market had an active 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was active as well as a number of major technology and media companies expanded their footprints in the area.","Rental rates continue to rise in a moderate rate and there are limited big block availabilities. In San Francisco, the sequel litigation involving Central SoMa and the new questions on how Prop M should be allocated, have heightened the focus on the lack of availability in the CBD for the foreseeable future. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be a quick resolution to these issues. The vacancy rate is at its lowest level since this last cycle begin after the great financial crisis. You would be hard pressed to find an existing 100,000 square foot block of continuous space in the market, direct or sublease.","The only new construction, the first admission development has an uncertain delivery days and it won\u2019t deliver before 2023. 633 Folsom, the only large addition major renovation has already been leased. There continued to be significant demand in the market with tenants like Pinterest and Salesforce committing to unentitled developments. In our portfolio, Salesforce Tower, 535 Mission, 680 and 690 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne are all 100% leased.","In Embarcadero center, we ended the quarter at 93.2% occupied, up 200 basis points from the last quarter and completed 235,000 square feet of full or multi-floor leasing. The percentage increase in rents from those floors was over 50% with an average new starting rate of $85 a square foot growth. Similar to Boston, tenants are requesting early renewal proposals.","We currently have another 175,000 square feet under negotiation that could be completed during the second quarter of 2019. If a tenant wants a full floor at Embarcadero center, it has one option prior to July of 2020. In the Silicon Valley, we continue to release our renew space at Mountain View Research at rents in excess of $60 triple net. This quarter, we completed a 47,000 square foot lease with a 60% roll up. And over the last two weeks, we did two renewals, totaling 91,000 square feet and have it \u2013 had an average increase of 80%. At platform 16 as Owen described, we are enabling the site preparing it for construction and we\u2019re making presentations to tenants, who are looking for 400,000 square feet or more and there are a number of them.","I\u2019m going to conclude my remarks this morning with some comments about the same property leasing steps for the quarter. You\u2019ll note a big jump in transaction costs. The statistics include one million square feet of 10-year or longer deals in New York City and San Francisco. This includes about 90,000 square feet of prebuilt suites or turnkey floors that we did. And we\u2019ve been describing those over in the last few years, where the improvements are in excess of $150 a square foot. Obviously, there\u2019s a tradeoff with accelerated occupancy, which is never reflected in the transaction cost numbers. Saving six months of downtime on a $100 rent, offsets the transaction costs of a deal by $50. And remember, we include the entire TI Package and commission into our statistics when we commence revenue recognition while the actual outlay of cash will occur over many quarters.","So, in conclusion, competition for talent remains top of mind for our customers and they continue to seek premium Class A space that reflects their brand and values. 2019 is progressing as we expected and we continue to be well positioned to grow our FFO in the coming years.","I\u2019ll stop here, Mike?","Mike LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. As Owen described, we had a strong quarter and raised our full-year FFO guidance again, and are now projecting 11% year-over-year FFO growth at the midpoint. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I do want to start with a couple of housekeeping items.","First, you will notice that we\u2019ve adopted the new lease accounting standard that was required this quarter, which adds right of use, operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities to our balance sheet. And on our income statement, rental income, operating expense recoveries and service fee income are now required to be reported together as lease income. For clarity, we will continue to provide the breakout of these items in our supplemental report. The requirement to include service fee income and lease revenue is creating geographic movement on our income statement as we had previously included service fee income in our development and management services income.","This change also impacts the components of our 2019 FFO guidance assumptions and we\u2019ve relocated approximately $8 million from development and management services income into our share of same property NOI. This shift increases our assumption for growth and our share of same property NOI by 50 basis points in 2019 from our guidance last quarter. I apologize for the accounting minutia, but I wanted to make sure everybody understands these changes.","Now, let\u2019s get into the details for the quarter. Q1 marked another strong quarter with 15% year-over-year FFO increase driven primarily by a 10% increase in our revenues from gains in portfolio occupancy, higher replacement rents on new and renewal leasing, and incremental revenue recognition from our development deliveries. This quarter, the roll up and rents from our second generation leasing was 9.4% on a net basis.","Our in-service portfolio occupancy improved by 150 basis points to 92.9%, primarily from gains at 399 Park Avenue in New York City and Salesforce Tower and Embarcadero Center in San Francisco. We anticipate that occupancy will range between 92.5% and 93.5% for the year. A part of this is due to faster than projected lease up and part is due to the anticipated sale of One Tower Center and removing 325 Main Street in Cambridge from service for the Google redevelopment. The removal of these two properties would increase our occupancy by 60 basis points.","In the debt markets, we just closed a $255 million construction loan to provide funding for the Marriott headquarters development. The loan is priced very attractively at LIBOR plus 125 basis points and reflects the quality of the project and the long-term lease with Marriott Corporation. This property is in a joint venture. So, our share of the loan is 50%.","Our active development pipeline represents $2.7 billion of new investment and remaining cost to fund our $1.3 billion net of the in-place construction financing. We expect to raise another $200 million of construction financing for our share of The Hub on Causeway office project later this year and the remaining costs will be funded with operating cash flow retained proceeds from asset sales and our line of credit. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion available on our line of credit and cash of $360 million.","As Owen described, we decided this quarter to sell One Tower Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and have an executed purchase and sale contract. Our decision caused us to shorten our hold period for the building resulting in an impairment on the property to its fair market value. We booked the $24 million impairment this quarter similar to gains or losses on sales. Property impairments are part of our net income, but are excluded from FFO pursuant NAREIT\u2019s definition. The sale is actually accretive to us, because at 39% occupancy, the property provides minimal NOI and we will earn an interest income or reduce our future borrowing with the cash from the sale.","Looking at first quarter results versus our guidance, our FFO of a $1.72 per share is $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. Approximately $0.03 per share of this was related to the timing of expenses, where we came in below our budget this quarter, but we expect to incur these expenses later in 2019. So, this portion will not increase our full-year FFO. The other $0.02 per share was due to portfolio performance. So, you should really look at this as $0.02 of outperformance for the quarter. The $0.02 were split between higher than projected service fee income and higher rental revenues from leasing space faster. This leasing was in our budgets for later in the year, so it does not result in a comparable step-up in our quarterly run rate for the full year.","Growth in our share of same property NOI for the quarter was strong and up over the last year by 7.7% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis. We project our same property NOI to show consistent growth for the remainder of the year. However, the growth rate over 2018 will slow in the back half of the year due to the comparable period in 2018 being higher. For the full year 2019, our current assumptions include growth in our share of same property NOI of 5.5% to 6.75% over 2018.","Net of moving $8 million of service fee income into the calculation, this represents an increase of 38 basis points at the midpoint from the last quarter. On a cash basis, we assume same property cash NOI growth of 5% to 6.5% over 2018. We\u2019ve also modified our assumption for development and management services income to $32 million to $36 million and that reflects the reduction of $8 million for moving service fees into lease revenue.","Given the more dovish outlook for interest rates in the past quarter, we\u2019ve adjusted our assumption for rates that has had a positive impact on our future financing costs in 2019. This, in combination with changes in our funding timing and additional asset sales, has resulted in our lowering our assumption for net interest expense for 2019, but $5 million to $405 million to $420 million for the full year. The result of these changes are that we\u2019re increasing our guidance for 2019 FFO to a new range of $6.95 to $7.02 per share representing an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint with the increase from $0.02 per share of improved portfolio NOI and $0.03 per share of lower interest expense.","As you start to think about 2020, there are a few things to keep in mind. We continue to expect the portfolio NOI to grow from both our development and our same property portfolio. We expect to deliver approximately $1.4 billion of our development pipeline between mid-2019 and the end of 2020. As is typical every year, we do expect some negative impact from temporary downtime related to our lease rollover exposure. Doug described our more meaningful 2020 lease rollouts, which are the GM Building and in Reston Town Center. In addition, we will have $10 million of our share of non-cash fair value lease revenue rolling off next year with much of this at the GM Building, where we see \u2013 where we will see incremental vacancy.","And finally, we expect to continue to utilize debt as the primary funding vehicle for our new developments. Although we capitalized interest on new developments, the delivery of $1.4 billion of our current pipeline, will result in a reduction of our capitalized interest and consequently higher total interest expense in 2020.","So, in summary, we had a good quarter with stronger than expected portfolio performance. We increased our FFO guidance for the year. We now project 2019 FFO growth of 11% at the midpoint over 2018, which is among the highest in our sector and the demand environment remains strong based on favorable economic trends in the vast majority of our markets. And we continue to execute on the growth strategy we\u2019ve outlined for the company.","That completes our remarks. Operator, I\u2019d appreciate if you could open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I know Doug talked a little bit about the tenant improvement spend this quarter being heightened and why that was the case. Mike, I wanted to see if you could give us maybe a feel for what a full-year number would look like for a TIs and leasing commissions, and then in terms of how we should think about Fed growth this year, if that would be similar to the 10% FFO growth in your guidance.","Mike LaBelle","Sure. Nick. No problem. So, Q1 is obviously as you mentioned, it was a high year for lease transaction costs. As Doug mentioned, we had some long-term leases and we also just had a tremendous amount of absorption, all right. So, we had 150 basis points of absorption to bring the portfolio up to 93% almost, which is \u2013 with that, that\u2019s kind of all drops into the quarter.","So, we do not expect every quarter this year to be identical to that. I mean our occupancy projection for the year, as I mentioned is that it\u2019s basically going to be stable if you kind of pull out the asset sales and taking the Google building out of service. So, we expect occupancy to actually drop a little bit in the second quarter and then come back up in the third and the fourth quarters although the rental rates should be higher in our rollover.","So, if you look at our full-year projection for what our AFFO will be in our lease transaction costs, we expect the lease transaction cost of total somewhere in the $210 million to $225 million range. So, a big chunk of this has already been experienced. And if you look at our roll over for the rest of the year, I mean, it\u2019s just not that big. So, the amount of leasing that we have to kind of get into place to keep the occupancy is not that significant. Most of the leasing that we\u2019re doing for the quarter is really going into the future years, right? So, that stuff is going into 2020 and 2021. Other pieces of our AFFO to think about include our straight line rents, which are $100 million to $120 million.","Our CapEx is going to be lower. So, our recurring CapEx we think is going to be somewhere in the $75 million to $90 million range. That\u2019s about $10 million or $15 million below last year. Stock comp is around $40 million and then other non-cash items is $20 million to $25 million. So, we kind of pull all that stuff together. You get to an AFFO that is somewhere in the $4.80 to $5 a share versus $4.43 in 2018. So that\u2019s pretty significant growth, which is kind of a combination of cash same-store growth and lower CapEx.","Nick Yulico","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful, Mike. Just second question is, if I think about the commentary that Doug gave on New York, it was less positive in other markets except Washington DC. So, I guess, I mean, if we think about a lot of the leasing demand right now that you are targeting, let\u2019s say in your development portfolio, which feels like it\u2019s a lot of tech, I mean you\u2019re talking about a increasingly life science, should we think about you guys may be looking to sell even more of your New York City portfolio besides 540 Madison, perhaps assets like 399 park, which is mostly stabilized or developments that you did this cycle.","Doug Linde","No, I wouldn\u2019t assume we\u2019re going to shrink our New York portfolio further. I mean, again, we\u2019re always open if we get approached by someone with we think an extraordinary results for shareholders, we\u2019re open-minded about it, but I don\u2019t think you should assume we\u2019re going to sell down our New York portfolio further.","Nick Yulico","Okay. I guess if you\u2019re just trying to reconcile the commentary on New York, which just seems like, you think the market\u2019s not doing as well as some of your other markets. And so then if that\u2019s the case, why still have the \u2013 as big of a presence in New York.","Owen Thomas","We think, we\u2019ve been saying this for years. We think New York is healthy. There\u2019s the aggregate, leasing demand has been at high level. Last year, it was a multiyear record for growth leasing. So, we think the market demand is healthy in New York and it\u2019s a healthy market. The issue has been supply. The Hudson Yards we have described as a secular event in the New York City real estate market and until the Hudson Yards gets fully absorbed, there will be more than typical supply in New York. And that is muting our ability to push rents up. But we certainly believe in New York in the long-term and intend to maintain a very significant presence there.","Doug Linde","Yes. Contextually, Nick, if you think about the demand picture in New York City, and actually, if you were to go look at the VC investments across the country now, there\u2019s actually more money being invested into New York City than there is in the Boston marketplace. And that follows the Silicon Valley in San Francisco. So, the tech, media, fintech world is very alive and vibrant in New York City. but as Owen said, there\u2019s a supply problem, which is sort of what my point was at the outset and those marketplaces, where there\u2019s not a supply problem, we\u2019re feeling really, really strong about our opportunity set in terms of the pushing rents, in those markets where there\u2019s a supply problem, namely New York City, modest supply problem in Washington DC, CBD, a significant supply problem.","We\u2019re not in a position, where we can do that. And net-net, we\u2019ve actually reduced our exposure in New York City, not necessarily by selling assets per se, but by selling interest in assets, which we did over the last, call it four or five years ago. And then we\u2019ve grown so much more in Boston and in San Francisco. Naturally, the contribution from New York City has diminished in a significant way.","So, I think we\u2019ve positioned the portfolio in a really thoughtful way, on a going-forward basis. And New York City will always be part of our portfolio and we hope that, there\u2019ll be a point in time in the relative near future, where the supply picture will have cut off and the technology, the media, the fintech businesses will have grown to a sufficient population of embedded demand that we\u2019re going to see the kind of strength that we\u2019re seeing in Boston and in San Francisco in those markets \u2013 in that market as well. But it\u2019s not going to happen in 2019, 2020 or 2021.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thank you, Doug and Owen.","Owen Thomas","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good morning everyone. Doug, you spoke a lot about early renewals and how successful we\u2019ve been with that. Can you just help us with how you think about those early renewals, especially in the case like Google, where you pointed out that even given the early renewal, you think that they will end up being below sort of market at the time the renewal starts if I understood that correctly.","Doug Linde","Yes, they\u2019re below\u2026","Manny Korchman","What\u2019s that?","Doug Linde","They\u2019re below market now. So, there\u2019ll be even more below market when the renewal starts. And so the logically Manny is something that I think is grounded is us for the 40 years of Boston Properties has been around, which is that, we\u2019re not market timers. We believe in leasing space to customers, who wanted to \u2013 who want to lease space when they want to lease the space. And we take our chances that doing long-term leases will serve us well and that we\u2019ll have opportunities to get the incremental growth upon rollovers and at the spot market by bringing new product online at those times. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change that profile. The most interesting thing about what I was just trying to describe was that our cash rent increases in 2021 and 2022 are being driven by our transactions today. And so there\u2019s going to be significant cash flow growth from the company\u2019s perspective on a going-forward basis and it\u2019s all going to be below market assuming the markets remain as healthy as they are today.","Owen Thomas","Yes. And also I would just add, I think Doug\u2019s point was we don\u2019t do early renewals below market. But the markets are moving up rapidly. So when these transactions were agreed to the market was at those levels. But the market is elevated since then. And the example that Doug gave were Google and the Salesforce now.","Manny Korchman","Got it. Thanks. Mike, an easy one for you. The expenses that are getting delayed later into the year, can you be more specific as to when those will hit just for modeling purposes?","Mike LaBelle","The repair and maintenance stuff I would guess will hit in the second and third quarter if I had to guess. And that is the majority of it. There was a little bit of G&A, because our healthcare costs came in a lot lower than we would expect and I anticipate that that will occur through the year. So, I would guess that it will be in second and third, and not fourth. But at least repair and maintenance item is it depends when the capital goes out, right? So, those are the stronger \u2013 those are the quarters, where we do most of that work, because of the weather related to \u2013 in the locations that we are in.","Manny Korchman","And one last one for me, the 540 Madison sale. Will that have any impact on how you think about acquisitions? I guess forcing your hands acquire something to offset that.","Mike LaBelle","It won\u2019t have an impact on acquisitions. I mean, if we will \u2013 as we always do, if we have a gain, we\u2019ll attempt to do like on exchange, but we won\u2019t be more tempted to buy something, because of that. If it works out in the flow of the business that we want to do based on the deals that we see that makes sense for shareholders will do the exchange, but we\u2019re not going to go out and \u201clook\u201d for an exchange deal.","Manny Korchman","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Hey, good morning guys. Maybe taking the sales question from another angle. I know Mike; you said most of the development near terms going to be funded with debt. but as you look at kind of the pricing that they got on Park Tower and the below market rents you have at Salesforce, I mean, is it tempting at all to maybe look to joint venture that now that you bought in the 5% interest?","Mike LaBelle","No, it\u2019s not. We think the salesforce tower is one of the premiere \u2013 certainly one of the premiere properties in our portfolio, it\u2019s a premiere port property in San Francisco, which is one of the strongest office markets in the country, if not the world. And it\u2019s not something that we want to joint venture. So, what we have been saying in terms of our sources of capital and we didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t review that this quarter, but let me just kind of go back through that.","Obviously, we generate cash flow from the company after we pay dividends. So that is a first stop for source of capital. The second would be as you\u2019re suggesting assets sales and we have been selling $200 million to $400 million or so of non-core assets each year. And that has been a source of funding for us. Last year, it was a little bit larger, because of the TSA deal that we engaged in. The third stop is debt and we \u2013 as we\u2019ve been talking about we are very focused on maintaining the leverage at current levels. So, the developments that we\u2019ve been delivering have given us increased debt capacity, which has created capital for the developments and for new investment. But there are limits to that. But we do certainly use financing to do it.","The next place we would have been going is joint venture partners. So, we brought in a joint venture partner on the Santa Monica Business Park investment that we made last year. I described in my remarks that we\u2019re talking to a capital partner of platform 16. And at the bottom of the list is, issuing common equity. So, the other thing that we\u2019ve mentioned is, many of our assets, certainly, the more significant ones have a tax basis that\u2019s well below their market value. So, they\u2019re not efficient from a capital raising perspective, because of the special dividend requirement.","Doug Linde","And salesforce tower in particular, yes.","Owen Thomas","Yes.","Doug Linde","It would have a massive gain associated with a JV of that asset that we would just have to distribute out and we wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to retain that. So\u2026","Craig Mailman","That\u2019s helpful. And just on Platform 16, I know you guys said you\u2019re talking with a partner, but from a timing perspective, would you want to get an anchor lease before you go ahead with the joint venture or does that factor into your thinking at all?","Owen Thomas","It doesn\u2019t factor into our thing today. We \u2013 when we agreed to purchase that asset we \u2013 I think, we recognize that bringing in a joint venture partner was part of the equation and the joint venture partners quite aware of the leasing activity and the conversations we\u2019re having and it\u2019s not, there\u2019s no \u201cthreshold\u201d about doing a lease to do that deal and while we \u2013 I guess in theory we could wait, get a lease and then do a joint venture at a different pricing model. We just \u2013 we felt that that was not the appropriate way to structure the capital of this particular asset.","Craig Mailman","Okay. That makes sense. Just one more quick one for Mike, you mentioned the burn off of cap interest next year, is it just, I know you guys have a lot of potential developments on your plays, just the spending at the outset just can\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s burning off. So, there\u2019s no way to kind of backfill that decline.","Mike LaBelle","Yes. I mean we\u2019re continuing to obviously add to our development pipeline and I wouldn\u2019t talk to about 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and 325 Main Street. So, we are continuing to add to that, but there\u2019s just a lot that is being completed if you look at our development pipeline and you look in the supplemental and the dates of when that stuff is coming in. So in 2020, we do not expect it to keep up. So, we do expect there to be materially lower capitalized interest next year than it was this year.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. In San Francisco, can you provide an update on the likelihood of Fort Harrison, getting its Prop M allocation this year? And also if you\u2019re interested or you\u2019re looking at the Ocean White developments, given it\u2019s a pretty valuable site.","Owen Thomas","So, I\u2019ll give you a succinct answer on Fort Harrison. The sequel lawsuits are ongoing. We don\u2019t anticipate the sequel lawsuits to be resolved in calendar year 2019 and we don\u2019t know how long they will take. There\u2019s a real question about how Prop M is going to be allocated. A lot of discourse and questions about that. So in our mind, it\u2019s unlikely that any of the projects will go forward that are currently part of Central SoMa in 2019 with regards to, there\u2019s a developer, who\u2019s building first admission. The project has got some \u2013 I think some timing issues, lots of people are trying to understand how they might be helpful in that situation.","John Kim","And are you one of those parties?","Owen Thomas","We don\u2019t comment on things that were \u2013 that we might or might not be doing.","John Kim","Okay. And then, Doug, you mentioned midtown Manhattan demand \u2013 kind of the demand being liked. Do you think there\u2019s going to be additional sublease space coming into the market? And you also were positive on demand from tech and media companies, but that\u2019s really more focused on Midtown South. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re hearing any discussions with any of these companies moving to Midtown?","Doug Linde","Yes. So, I just want to \u2013 I guess I want to reiterate what I said. I said that I felt that the demand at the very high end was lighter this quarter and last quarter than it has been. In the high end, I define as over $130 a square foot, which is those are the people, who would be going into the very expensive space. I think the market itself is actually very healthy. So, if you have $85 to $100 space, I think there are lots of people that you\u2019re talking to and there are lots of opportunities from the demand side to fill space. John, did you want to talk about the tech demand going in midtown?","John Powers","No, I think that, you\u2019d have it. The demand is very good here. The issue that\u2019s holding the prices flat is the supply coming onto the market. The good news is there\u2019s a lot of people looking at the supply.","John Kim","One last question on dock 72. Can you just discuss the increase in construction costs and the stabilization date being moved out?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So, we\u2019ve found some things that were either in an unforeseen conditions when we were doing the site work and\/or coordination issues between the contractors and the A&E professionals that have just led to some cost increases. But more importantly, given how long it\u2019s taken us to get to stabilization of the construction, which is now clearly going to happen in September. We pushed out our lease up and so we\u2019re carrying the full project cost for an extended period of time. I think it\u2019s almost a year than when we previously had. I will tell you that relative 90 days ago, the tenant activity has picked up at dock 72. And if you go over there, it feels like a pretty unique interesting opportunity for tenants to lease space with fabulous outdoor spaces with an amenity center that\u2019s going to be bar in the second to none when there was an announcement yesterday about, the new Wegmans that\u2019s going in and the other property that\u2019s under construction. Dock 72 is really shaping up. And unfortunately for us, it was more of a show me as opposed to \u2013 show me the plans but \u2013 and then we\u2019ll make a lease, but actually show me what it looks like, and I want to feel it, see it, touch it before I can really get a sense of it. And we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing right now. John, any other comments on that?","John Powers","The ferries starting May 24th, that\u2019s a big plus. The shuttles are all running on time and on an app and people like it a lot. So, we\u2019re getting a lot more action. But as I\u2019ve said in this call, a number of times, this is an asset, where people, as Doug said, they\u2019re going to have to, when we work moves in September and the amenities opening in October, people can rover over and really experience it and they can take the ferry to get there.","Owen Thomas","I think that I just want to clarify that a big piece of the increase is equity carry. So, it\u2019s a non-cash concept, it\u2019s something we always put on our budgets, which is the carry cost that we charge ourselves for our own equity and that obviously, impacts the job as you extend out the lease up.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thanks and good morning. So, I wanted to start with LA and Santa Monica, can you talk more about the spaces you\u2019re getting back and what the interest pipeline looks like given we have seen a pickup in demand in some of the other kind of media focus submarkets Hollywood, Burbank some of the others, just curious what you\u2019re leasing prospects look like?","Doug Linde","Yes. Let me make a quick comment then I\u2019ll have Ray, Ray pick it up. So, the only space that we know that we\u2019re getting back is the space that is currently occupied by HBO at Colorado Center and they\u2019ve made a decision to relocate to Culver Crossing, and that\u2019s going to happen 12\/31\/2020. So, everything else that we\u2019re working on in both the Santa Monica Business Park and Colorado Center is that space and then doing early renewals with our existing tenants in tow, which include technology and media companies, and we\u2019re encouraged by their interest in staying in the property and really, they may have some other opportunities to go outside of Santa Monica. But in Santa Monica, we\u2019re sort of the only game in town. Ray?","Ray Ritchey","Yes. Thanks, Doug. So, specifically, at Colorado Center, we have a \u2013 we had discussions with Hulu regarding their future growth. HBO was kind of in the path of that growth. So, while we were sad to see HBO be one, it was strategically more important to have that block to accommodate the larger tenant. What\u2019s really interesting is while there are intense discussions with our existing tenant. Other tenants in the project are already calling us up about that space and others so that the demand in Santa Monica is just as strong as it was when we acquired the building 3.5 years ago and we see nothing in the horizon that does not have Santa Monica being a main demand driver. We are seeing some exiting to some of the other markets if it only defined larger blocks at lower prices, but we still are exceedingly excited about the Colorado Center in Santa Monica Business Park.","Jamie Feldman","Hi. Thank you. And then what\u2019s your appetite to expand there? I know there\u2019s some buildings that have \u2013 that are being marketed?","Ray Ritchey","Well, we are \u2013 go ahead Doherty.","Robert Doherty","Yes. I was just going to say, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Ray. Our appetite remains strong. We want to grow LA into significant region for Boston Properties, just like all our other regions. However, we\u2019re going to do it in a disciplined fashion. And the way we\u2019ve been describing it to ourselves and to all of you is we want to do a deal a year that\u2019s a way to think about it. But it has been challenging this year, there have been a number of assets that have traded at prices that we didn\u2019t want to pay and we\u2019re also looking at a number of development sites as well. Ray?","Ray Ritchey","Hey, listen, we came here at three years ago and we\u2019re now up to 2.5 million square feet. Current occupancy levels are in the high 90s. We\u2019ve come in second on three or four different other opportunities in LA. But we held on to our discipline and didn\u2019t overreach for those and we are actively considering three or four more opportunities right now. So, we are all in an LA for sure. And I\u2019d like to introduce John Lang, our LA Regional Manager, who is also on the call and John, anything else you want to add?","John Lang","No, I would just add to it. To Owen\u2019s comment, there\u2019s been a lot of opportunities here in this past quarter, some of which are traded for pretty healthy pricing, but we\u2019re aggressive and we\u2019re seeking opportunities both the marketed and the non-marketed development and existing asset acquisitions, but we want to remain disciplined with our path to growth.","Doug Linde","And I would just like to add that while we\u2019re very excited about the acquisitions of the real estate we have in that market. We\u2019re really excited about having John joined our team. He\u2019s only been with us over a year and he\u2019s already made a tremendous difference in our presence in the LA market and we\u2019re extremely grateful to have him.","Jamie Feldman","Great. How would you say, now that you\u2019ve been there a while, how would you say, be it speak and differentiate itself in the market? What do you bring fresh to the market?","Doug Linde","You\u2019re asking me or John?","Jamie Feldman","Whoever would like to answer.","Doug Linde","Okay. I would answer and John could comment that I think our outreach to the existing tenants in our portfolio, our outreach to community leaders, our ability to develop close relationships with brokers has distinguished us from the traditional development and landlord community in LA. And I think we\u2019re a little bit of a breath of fresh air to the LA market. John, would you care to comment on that?","John Lang","Yes. I would reiterate all of those things. And Jamie, for you and a couple other folks that have recently been to Colorado Center. We\u2019re taking a very hands-on approach, not just with our relationships with our customers and our tenants, but with our physical improvements. So, we just rolled out the new public plaza here at Colorado Center. We\u2019ve got a new best-in-class food hall experience that\u2019s going to be opening here shortly. So, I think we\u2019re putting in the strategic capital here that\u2019s a little more thoughtful, and a little more strategic with what the tenants in today\u2019s world are demanding. So, Colorado Centers are great example of that and with Ray\u2019s help and with our kind of Cross Country collaboration and making sure that we are leveraging everyone\u2019s collective resources across our regions.","Colorado center quickly went to 100% leased, in about two years since the acquisition and that was before all of the capital was deployed here and you can actually feel and see the improvements. So, I think that\u2019s a great success story and we\u2019re on the right path to do that at the Santa Monica Business Park as well. And just take a little bit more of a hands-on approach compared to some of the other owner and operators here.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, great. That\u2019s a very helpful. Switching gears to Mike, can you \u2013 are you able to quantify some of the drags on earnings you mentioned rolling into 2020, like assuming your share count stays the same, maybe like pennies per share or some other way to think about it?","Mike LaBelle","Well, I think Doug described some of the numbers. So, I think, Doug said, GM was $13 million and Reston was $17 million. So, those are kind of the big moves and we still believe we\u2019re going to be able to demonstrate growth in the same-store portfolio. Every year, we\u2019ve got rollouts, right? And then we try to explain them to them, what\u2019s renewing and what\u2019s rolling out? So, a lot of the stuff that is on the expiration table. We\u2019re in the process of renewing and we\u2019re working on those kinds of things. There are some where we know the tenants are going to leave. So these are the ones that are more sizable where we know they\u2019re going to leave to give you some sense for \u2013 to help you I guess, along the way. I can\u2019t tell you what our guidance is right now. It\u2019s honestly just too early. We still think it\u2019ll be positive. We just think there\u2019s a couple of things in there that will hamper a stronger growth profile.","Jamie Feldman","Okay.","Doug Linde","Okay. I just want to \u2013 I\u2019d like to give you sort of the following sort of framework, which is if you think about our year-to-year projections. What we\u2019ve described is, we are \u2013 it\u2019s not 100%, really close to 100% occupied both Boston and in San Francisco. And there\u2019s very limited rollover in those marketplaces and we\u2019re seeing very significant as I described, mark-to-mark least increases and therefore, increases in either our FFO, if there is a modest amount of build out time in our cash rents. We have our biggest exposures in 2020, which \u2013 and the reason I brought it up is, because we\u2019ve asked \u2013 been asked the question every single time we\u2019ve had a one-on-one meeting with anybody and we\u2019ve done a number of NDRs over the last quarter are the General Motors building in New York City and the Reston Town Center Market in Northern Virginia. That\u2019s the vast majority of our \u201cexposure\u201d and I tried to articulate what that exposure was.","We believe that the power of San Francisco and the power of Boston are going to continue to overwhelm the other issues, but that there is some degree of pull down from that particular exposure, because that property is currently leased today. And then we have a few other negatives in terms of the properties that we\u2019re taking out of service, including as soon as we described the 325 Main Street, which is pulling $4 million out in 2020 and 2021. So, we tried to sort of give you a good roadmap for how you might think about your modeling of our portfolio on the revenue side, did you think about 2020 and 2021.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And those are revenue numbers, not NOI numbers?","Doug Linde","Yes, revenue number.","Jamie Feldman","GM investment?","Doug Linde","Yes.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore.","Jason Green","Good morning. Just a quick question on the Boston market. The Boston Seaport is kind of the only major Boston submarket, you\u2019re not in currently. Is that a submarket we could see you enter or does it not necessarily fit the profile what you guys look for in assets?","Mike LaBelle","We continue to look at it just like every other market is part of our core markets, it\u2019s definitely part of the Boston core market. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right opportunity. I would comment to echo what Doug\u2019s been talking about with tenant inspired play on renewals. The seaports interesting, if you take one specific asset out that is caught on the edge of worse things happening, it\u2019s like a 2.3% vacancy, which is incredibly low. And then in that greater call at Boston market, we\u2019re looking at everything, submarkets in the 6% range. So, it\u2019s really interesting that each of these markets is a firing on all cylinders right now. And a lot of it has to do with echoing what Doug and OT talked about was incredible discipline right now at least for the time being in terms of development coming on with significant pre-leasing and that still bodes well as we look at the forecast for the next couple of years, as we look at the developable sites, all of them have significant pre-leased play on them.","Jason Green","Got it. And then maybe just switching over to Reston, as the government continues to talk about housing reform and potentially some changes to Fannie Mae, is there any risk to the lease at Reston Town Center and given the company moving into what might be viewed as relatively expensive space might not be perceived the right way?","Ray Ritchey","You\u2019re talking about risk relative to the credit of the tenant, right?","Doug Linde","It was a legal risk \u2013 it\u2019s a legal risk.","Ray Ritchey","So, we have a binding lease with the agency or the NGO or NGA. And our understanding of all the discussions that are going on in Washington DC have to do with the future of how mortgages are securitized. I believe that the bonds that have been issued by both Freddie and Fannie go well beyond the least that we have at Reston, which is, I think 12 years starting in 2022.","So, we are not concerned on a cash basis in terms of receiving our rent from the tenant. What happens to that organization and how that organization is ultimately changed relative to the way the private mortgage market works. I think that\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess and in 2035, it could be an issue.","Jason Green","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one final question, and that question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mike, just quickly going back to some of the items that you mentioned for next year. You mentioned that $13 million coming out of the GM Building, if $10 million in size, is that in addition to the $13 million? So in effect it\u2019s a $23 impact of 2020 from the GM Building coming out?","Mike LaBelle","Yes. That\u2019s in addition to the $13 million, that\u2019s a non-cash front.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Okay. And then the 540 Madison is in guidance or that\u2019s not in guidance or it closes so late in the year that it\u2019s really immaterial to the share.","Mike LaBelle","The 540 Madison Avenue was not in guidance, because we don\u2019t have any kind of agreement on it. It\u2019s picked on the market at this point. So, the only sale is the Tower Center sale that we announced that is in the guidance.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally, just thinking about funding for your pipeline, you were clear that equity issuances is last in your list, but it seems like between free cash flow that $200 million to $400 million of dispose that you guys think about. And then Jay being on new \u2013 on sort of new projects, it seems like you guys have found a pretty good balance for funding developments going forward. So, the big dispositions that would sort of the loop growth in the past, it seems like you guys have now gotten your funding model to a pretty good way, where you don\u2019t sort of have that anymore. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Mike LaBelle","I think that\u2019s true, Alex, our selling program that we have been going through the last five years. I mean raising capital is a nice outcome, but the real reason is we\u2019re selling assets that are non-core to the company going forward. So, we still \u2013 we\u2019ll have some of those in future years. But I agree with what you\u2019re saying. I think that we have between our own resources and the resources of a growing list of capital partners, we will \u2013 we are not capital constrained in terms of making new investments.","Owen Thomas","And the other thing that we focused on Alex is our leverage. So right now, our leverage is at six and a half times, since conservative are \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be north of seven. If you look at the pipeline we have today and new pro forma were below six. So, there\u2019s a lot of room there for us to work, which is why we\u2019re comfortable using a good amount of debt for some of this. And then we bring in partners on some of this, just linked in that capability of that existing balance sheet to continue to work.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Owen Thomas","Okay, sure. Operator, are we all set, that\u2019s the end of the question?","Operator","Yes. I will now turn the call back over to you guys for closing remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Thank you very much for all of your interest in Boston Properties. That includes the questions and our remarks. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call.

Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning and welcome to Boston Properties first quarter earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In this supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","If you did not receive a copy these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bostonproperties.com. An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Tuesday's press release and from time-to-time in the Company's filings with the SEC.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President our regional management team will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Arista. And good morning, everyone. We had another very productive quarter and continue to make steady progress with our growth plan. The highlights for the last quarter include, we generated FFO per share of $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior forecast and raised the midpoint of our full year 2018 guidance by $0.02. We leased 2.1 million square feet, which is significantly above our long-term quarterly averages for this period.","We signed an 850,000 square foot lease agreement with Fannie Mae for a 1.1 million square foot development at Reston Gateway in Reston Town Center and in the last week we committed to purchase the Santa Monica business park in West L.A. and we achieved our energy, water and emissions intensity reduction goals three years early and establish new more aggressive goals for 2025.","So moving to the environment. Importantly for our business economic conditions continue to be healthy and relatively stable. The overall outlook for US GDP this year remains positive with growth projected to reach approximately 2.8%. Job creation remains steady with 616,000 jobs created in the first quarter and employment is stable at 4.1%.","While an economic downturn will eventually arrive, it is very difficult to forecast its timing and certainly doesn't feel imminent. Though their hawkish tones in the fixed income markets with the Fed increasing short term interest rates and the U.S. fiscal deficit widening, the yield curve has been flattening with the 10 year U.S. Treasury rate rising around 50 basis points this year.","Though we expect further Fed rate hikes in 2018, global rates and inflation continue to be low and we anticipate relatively modest increases in long-term U.S. interest rates in the near term.","The office markets and sub markets where we operate continue to remain in general equilibrium. The new deliveries are outpacing net absorption. Overall net absorption for our five markets this quarter was 4.7 f million square feet, while deliveries were 8.3 million.","The vacancy rate in our markets remains relatively low at 8.8% [ph] which increased the modest 40 basis points this quarter, while asking rents grew by 0.4%. Leasing activity remains quite healthy with broad based activity across multiple industries.","In the private real estate market significant office transaction volume ended the first quarter at just over $20 billion, which is down 27% from the first quarter of '17. However we see a healthy supply of offerings and anticipate the decreasing volumes to stabilize later in the year.","Commercial real estate continues to see interest from both domestic and international investors and cap rates remain healthy in our core markets. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter.","In Boston, 28 State Street is under agreement to sell for $739 a square foot and a 4.8% initial cap rate to a domestic pension adviser. This is a 570,000 square foot building and it's full - more or less fully leased.","In New York, Chelsea Market sold for $2000 a square foot to Google's parent company Alphabet. The building is 1.2 million square feet and fully leased with Google occupying around 400,000 square feet.","Also in midtown New York, Manhattan tower which is located directly across the street from our 599 Lexington Avenue property sold for just over a $1000 a square foot and up 4.3% initial cap rate. This 300,000 square foot building is 99% leased and was sold to a domestic insurance holding company. And there are a number of transactions in the pipeline expected to close in the second quarter.","Moving to our capital activity, with the sale of 500 E Street, we are on track - we are on track to sell 200 to 300 million in non-core assets this quarter. On acquisitions, we continue to pursue value added opportunities in our core markets with a focus on L.A.","In line with this strategy, our big news this week as we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Santa Monica business Park, a 47 acre 1.2 million square foot office in retail campus in the ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica California. This site is comprised of 15 office and six retail buildings and is 94% leased.","Unlike the myriad of 200,000 square foot or less buildings that we've been offered in West L.A. over the last few years, this is our kind of project, given its scale, its suitability to larger corporate tenants, the redevelopment opportunities that could present themselves over time and the changing positive dynamics of the location over the next decade, given the potential decommissioning of the Santa Monica Airport. It is possible that we will bring a capital partner into the investment.","With this acquisition we will double the size of our Los Angeles portfolio at 2.4 million square feet and will own a critical mass in Santa Monica with 24% of the competitive office space in the market. This transaction is obviously an important next step in our strategy to grow Boston Properties presence in the Los Angeles market.","Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders. We remain very active with several new pre-lease projects either committed or under pursuit. We signed a lease agreement with Fannie Mae this quarter for approximately 850,000 feet to anchor 1.1 million square foot two tower office complex at Reston Gateway.","Reston Gateway is a 22 acre site located immediately south of Reston Town Centers urban core and west of our Discovery Square and Reston Corporate Center Property. The site is also directly adjacent to the future Reston Town Center Metro station anticipated to open in 2020, which will connect Reston via the Silver Line to both Washington D.C. and Dulles Airport.","With this lease, we're kicking off the first part of our multi-phase development of Reston Gateway which could ultimately contain 3.5 million square feet of space. In addition to the two office buildings anchored by Fannie Mae, future plans for the western portion of the Reston Gateway site include a mid-sized hotel over 600,000 square feet of residential and approximately 90,000 square feet of ground floor retail all complementing the amenity base and community environment of the highly successful Reston Town Center. Fannie Mae will be an occupancy in the first quarter of 2022.","Additionally, we have signed an LOI and are working on a final agreement to purchase a minority stake in a site at 3 Hudson Boulevard in partnership with the Moinian Group, the current owner. This site supports a 2 million square foot office building and is located on Hudson Boulevard adjacent to a park and the nearly completed seven train entrance.","Boston Properties would assume operational control of the co-development. Construction on the foundation for the redesigned tower is underway and we anticipate commencing vertical construction upon execution of an anchor tenant lease.","And lastly, as Doug will cover in a moment, we also have active lease discussions under what Cambridge and Boston that could lead to additional near term development start.","So with all that, our current development pipeline stands at 13 office and residential developments and redevelopments comprising 6.5 million feet and $3.5 billion of investment. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.4 billion remaining to fund.","The commercial component of this portfolio is 83% pre-leased, an aggregate projected cash yield are approximately 7%. This pipeline by the way excludes the previously discussed 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and Fannie Mae developments which we expect to commence later in 2018.","We are winning significant new development business based on the quality of our sites, our team and execution, not by lowering our return requirements. Further, we expect to fund all this new development without raising equity or increasing our company leverage - level given the debt capacity made available to us through our near term development deliveries. Most notably the Salesforce Tower.","So to summarize on capital strategy, our best use of capital today is launching new pre-lease development and making select value added acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisitions and the inferred cap rate in repurchasing our shares, notwithstanding their material discount to NAV.","Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing, which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to self-select non-core assets, which raises marginal capital. The sale of larger core assets is a less efficient funding source given significant embedded tax gains and result in special dividend requirements.","Lastly, we continue to emphasize and execute on our sustainability strategy by pursuing conservation measures that have positive economic and environmental outcomes. We recently updated our energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction goals, as we exceeded our 2020 targets three years early. Our new goals establish a bolder reduction targets for energy and water use, as well as emissions by 2025.","To conclude, we remain confident with our plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93% and longer term growth is now becoming more clear and likely given all the new developments we've added and expect to add to our pipeline.","So over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. When I have a conversation with any of our tenants or our investors or anybody else who's interested in the real estate market, the first question they always ask is, so how is your business. How are you doing? And my response right now is that Boston Properties is as busy as we have ever been.","We have strong leasing activity at our 46 million square foot operating portfolio. As Owen said, we're an active construction on $3.5 billion of new developments, 83% pre-leased and we've entered into new leases on additional development which will lead to an additional $1.1 billion of new office developments.","Our primary customer, large real estate users, public or private or start-up are established are exhibiting confidence by making the decisions to upgrade and consolidate their space and in some cases they are expanding.","We just opened our second residential development in Reston in January. We've leased 86 out of 508 units. We are going to open our second Boston area residential building in Cambridge in June and we've already leased 31 out of 244 market rate units.","And if the conversation I'm having is with an investor, I hammer gently with a finished nail not a big stick one, how we will experience meaningful FFO growth from occupancy gains and our development deliveries during 2019 and 2020.","Now obviously there are some nuances in individual markets which we'll talk, but in short, our short and medium term opportunity set feels really good and things feel great.","Now there have been some market conditions changes since our January call and the most significant have been in midtown New York City. JPMorgan's decision to remain and grow on Park Avenue and 47 Street has changed the conversation amongst the New York City real estate community.","Instead of talking about the migration west or the demise of Park Avenue, the commentary has shifted to movement not based on location, but rather on new construction and capital investment. In fact, I've seen one recent broker's report that suggests that more than two thirds of all of the relocations in Manhattan in 2016 and '17 were to new product or buildings that have received significant capital infusions.","Additionally, the reduction of available space, primarily at 390 Madison required by the JPMorgan enabling move has provided some real tightening to the Park Avenue market. The results have been a change in mood and a firming of lease economics. And as it happens, the leasing activity in Manhattan in the late 2017 and 2018 is being led by the fire sector which enjoys the advantages that Midtown offers.","We have completed almost 190,000 square foot of leases during the quarter, including another full floor law firm expansion in our midtown portfolio, in the tower section of 399 Park, we have leased the 25,000 square foot floor and we have three leases outstanding totaling 135,000 square feet and over 400,000 square feet of proposals on the remaining space.","At the base of the building, we have nearly a million square feet of proposal for 260,000 square feet of availability. We have a lease out for the entirety of our 159 East 53rd Street redevelopment and 30,000 square feet of leases in progress on the remaining 34th and 33rd floors at the General Motors building which takes up about two thirds of that space.","Our New York City portfolio is well positioned to gain significant occupancy and revenue during the latter half of '19. Construction at Dock 72 is progressing and we expect to deliver space so we work this quarter with an expected completion of their work and the amenity space in early '19.","While we are showing the space the Brooklyn large tenant activity has been light and tenants have more of a just in time perspective. So we don't anticipate much leasing until the amenities spaces are close to completion.","Market fundamentals continue to improve in San Francisco, as the availability of new product becomes scarcer and scarcer and the technology of tenants continue to expand. Park Tower is in active discussions for the majority if not all of that 750,000 square foot building. The next new product will be first in mission in 2022 or beyond and a 270,000 square foot rehab expansion which has not yet started, but it's expected to commence this year at 633 Folsom.","Large blocks of contiguous available space are going to come in the form of space coming from tenants that are moving to new construction, the Dropbox sublet at 345 333 Brannan, Salesforce at Rinc\u00f3n Center, 50 Beale, once Blue Cross, Blue Shield relocates to Oakland.","As we move into 2018, our CBD activity is going to be focused upon 80,000 square foot of space that we have at EC1 that resulted from a tenant relocation to Salesforce Tower where we have leases in negotiation for about 70,000 square feet and four non-contiguous floors at EC4 and then some early renewals.","We've increased the leasing at Salesforce Tower to 98% this quarter and we have a leasing negotiation on the final available floor, all non-tech users are filling up the rest of Salesforce Tower.","It's important to note that full floor, financial or business service demand is not as robust as the Tecla growth in the city. And while there has been significant increase in rent for large blocks of availabilities, geared towards the tech tenant, rent growth in the older towers has trailed the new inventory.","The Silicon Valley has also had a pickup in activity. The existing classic inventory is being absorbed. The latest mega deal being a million square foot leased at Moffett Towers and Sunnyvale for buildings that will be delivered in '19. We did two deals totaling 64,000 square feet this quarter at our single story product in Mountain View where the average rent increased 25% and starting rents are close to $56, triple net, single storey product.","My remarks for the D.C. market continue to follow three themes. First, matching site and tenants together to launch new development, which is the heart of our DC franchise. Last quarter it was 210 Penn and Leidos at 1715 in Reston, the previous quarter it was Marriott and Bethesda [ph] and the TSA and as Owen discussed this quarter it's a Fannie Mae transaction and Reston Town Center 3, otherwise known as Reston Gateway.","The second theme is the strength of the Reston Town Center market, as a magnet for private sector contractors and technology tenants. We continue to see strong end demand. We have recently signed two expansion and extension deals with technology tenants for 112,000 square feet. One tenant grew 30% and the other grew 40%. And we are negotiating a third expansion and extension this time growing 115,000 square feet tenant to a 160,000 square feet. We are also in early renewal discussions with tenants for more than 300,000 square feet of space.","And finally in D.C. on the margin, the omnibus budget is a positive development for the CBD market because it includes billions of dollars of increased spending for non-dispense sectors of the economy and the government. It's unclear how much will flow into new job creation and translate into increased GSA or contractor demand or when it will lead to additional leasing. But it's a net positive.","Now there will be and has been and are going to be an abundance of partially leased recently renovated CBD assets, and the market will continue to be highly competitive. In Boston, the market continues to improve. As good as our activity is in New York City or San Francisco NBC, in Boston we completed 33 transactions totaling over 400,000 square feet this quarter and overall the percentage lease in our Boston Regional Office assets is the strongest in the company at 95%.","When we started the quarter we had six floors of availability on our entire CBD portfolio. Five of those floors are now leased. Our largest negotiation in the region now involves a piece of space that expires in 2022. We have signed retail users for 30,000 square feet of the Hub spaced over the garden which gets us to over 90% of the retail space committed and we're now at 88% of that total project leased.","Demand for space in the city of Boston continues to grow as technology tenants are expanding at pace that we've never seen, and it's as strong as we have ever seen it. With our lease with Rapid7 at the Hub on Causeway and the remaining space at Pier 4 being committed most of - not all of the new existing inventory under construction begun.","In addition, Amazon and Wayfair are close to very significant expansions in the Seaport and the Back Bay and we continue to work with an anchor tenant for the tower at the Hub on Causeway.","In Cambridge where we have a limited availability, we continue to have discussions with a tenant for the next office development at Kendall Center. If this project moves forward we will replace 115,000 square foot building with a 400,000 square foot tower with construction commencing in mid-2019 and across the street on Main Street MIT is reportedly in conversation for all of their office inventory.","Even as many tenants are attracted to the city centers of Boston and Cambridge, there continues to be significant demand in our Waltham Lexington suburban portfolio. We are in lease negotiations for the entire availability at Reservoir North 73,000 square feet with a tenant that's coming out of a 30,000 square foot building and we are talking to an existing tenant at CityPoint that would grow from 22,000 square feet to 47,000 square feet expanding at 20 CityPoint. Starting with new construction are over $50 a square foot in a suburb, while Class A existing product ranges from the low 40s to the mid-40s.","I'm going to conclude my remarks this morning with some comments about our same property leasing statistics for the quarter. You will note a jump in transaction costs. This is true across all our markets and illustrates the concession the market has been giving for the last few years for leases of 10 plus years, as well as the cost of pre-built suites, which we have been describing for the last couple of years.","Obviously there's a trade-off with accelerating occupancy on pre-built which is not reflected in these numbers. If you save six months of downtime on a $90 rented space it reduces the transaction cost of the deal by $45, but that doesn't show up in these statistics. Overall, on a mark-to-market basis, we were up about 13%. However there were some real variety and variability there.","In Boston the roll up came primarily from our Cambridge portfolio, a transaction I described last quarter where we took back space from Microsoft and re-let it. And the roll down in New York City comes from a full floor seven year renewal and the low right portion of the General Motors building that was done in January of 2015 and hit the statistics this quarter where the rent went from $150 a square foot to $116 a square foot, but there was only a $20 of square foot tenant improvement allowance. So all these numbers are confusing and there's always a story behind them.","With that, I'm going to stop and let the call go to Mike.","Michael LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Hope you all are as excited as we are about our revamped supplemental financial package. If you haven't looked, hopefully you'll check it out, we've reorganized and reformatted it to make it much easier to read.","There are a couple of accounting related items I want to point out that changes in our financial disclosure this quarter. First one is due to the change in the FASBs rules for revenue recognition that we adopted this quarter, we've included on our income statement both the payroll expense and the reimbursement income for payroll costs for management service contracts.","These items which each totaled $2.9 million for the quarter offset each other and net to zero and they will net to zero each quarter. Previously we had simply netted the expense against the reimbursement.","The other item is on our financial highlights page, where we are now disclosing our capitalized internal leasing costs and external legal costs related to leasing. This totaled $1.7 million for the quarter. And the reason I pointed out is that the new lease accounting rules that we will adopt in 2019 will require us to start expensing these costs.","I suspect that there will be lots of quarterly variability in this item. So at a minimum I would anticipate $0.04 to $0.06 per share of additional expense to hit our FFO in 2019. Okay. Sorry for the digression into accounting minutiae.","As you can see from our press release, we've been very busy this quarter. Owen describes some of our investment activity in asset sales. We've also been active in the debt markets. Last week we closed a $180 million four year construction loan with a syndicate of banks to fund construction of the residential component of our Hub on Causeway development and later this week we expect to close on a $120 million mortgage to refinance our existing loan on 540 Madison Avenue in New York City that expires later this year. We expect to reduce our credit spread on that by 40 basis points and extend for five years.","And yesterday we drew down a 100% of our $500 million unsecured term loan that we closed last year. Proceeds will be used to repay our outstanding line of credit balances to fund the equity portion of the Santa Monica business Park acquisition and fund development costs.","Turning to our earnings results, we reported funds from operation of a $1.49 per share for the first quarter. That was $2 million or about a penny per share above the midpoint of our guidance. Our share of the NOI from the portfolio exceeded our budget by approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share. The outperformance came from earlier than projected leasing, primarily in Cambridge where we signed a 90,000 square foot new lease to backfill the majority of the 110,000 square feet of space vacated by Microsoft in December and at a much higher rent. That's consistent with what Doug commented on about our lease statistics.","And in New York City, we took back a floor at 601 Lexington Avenue from a tenant with a near term expiration, received a payment and leased the space immediately to another tenant.","The improvement in the portfolio in OI for the quarter was partially offset by approximately $2 million of higher than projected G&A expense. The increase was due to higher health care costs and higher than projected non-cash stock compensation.","As it is every year, our first quarter G&A is higher than subsequent quarter due to the stock competition investing provisions and the timing of payroll taxes. As we look at the rest of 2018, we continue to be encouraged by the level of leasing activity that we're seeing on our vacancy, as well as early renewal opportunities for leases expiring in 2019 through 2022, many of which will have a positive mark-to-market in rent.","The activity that Doug described in Boston, the leases in negotiation at 399 Park Avenue and activity on our vacant space at Embarcadero Center all will improve our portfolio occupancy. Some of these deals will take occupancy at the tail end of this year, but the majority of the impact will not be realized until 2019.","Based upon what we are experiencing, we're increasing our assumption for the growth in our 2018 NOI from the same property pool by 25 basis points at the midpoint to 1% to 2.5%. We have not modified our same property cash NOI assumptions as these deals typically have free rent periods and inception or the NOI growth is from early renewals where the bump up in cash rent will not occur until the natural lease expiration.","We project our non-cash straight line rents will total $60 million to $80 million for 2018, which is up $5 million at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. We've also increased our projection for development and management services income to $31 million to $36 million for the year, an increase of $2 million at the midpoint.","The increase is primarily related to higher service income projections, as well as leasing commissions in our joint ventures and third party managed portfolios. We're adjusting our assumption for G&A expense to $118 million to $121 million for the year. That's up $2 million at the midpoint and mostly due to the impact of the first quarter results.","Overall, we are increasing our guidance for 2018 funds from operations by bringing up the low end of our range by $0.04 per share to a new guidance range of $6.27 to $6.36 per share. This equates to a midpoint increase of $0.02 per share and that's due to our assumptions for portfolio NOI, increasing $0.03 per share, fee income increasing $0.01 per share offset by $0.02 per share of higher G&A expense.","We have not included the impact of the acquisition of Santa Monica business Park in these assumptions, as we are still finalizing the ultimate capital structure for the deal. However assuming a July 1 closing, we anticipate it will be a creative to our 2018 FFO projections by approximately a penny per share.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, I'd appreciate it if you could open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. So I guess, you know first off on Santa Monica Business Park, you know there was some trade publications that have written about the deal. It sounds like there were a lot of parties interested in the site. Can you talk a little bit about how you underwrote the asset? It sounds like there could be some below market leases there that are rolling over the next couple of years, you know, how should we think about the yield on day one versus a more stabilized yields for the project?","Owen Thomas","Good morning, Nick. So a couple of things we will say about the pricing. So first of all as Mike mentioned, the deal is accretive to us day one. Let me talk about the yield and let me talk about the per square foot. So on the yield, the initial NOI yield on the asset is somewhere in the mid to high threes, and that is rising to over 6% by year five.","I should also mention that roughly 60% of that lift is from leases that have been signed that are - that have not commenced rent payment. So from an income standpoint the profile of this investment is similar to the Colorado Center investment that we made two years ago. But actually there's less leasing risk here, because in Colorado Center we had actual vacancy, whereas here there's a lot of the lift is from again leases that have been signed that are not paying rent yet.","Then second on the per square foot. Obviously you can do the math on the square footage and the price that we've disclosed. However, to be apples-and-apples with other transactions that are quoted on the simple basis, roughly 70% of the assets in this park are encumbered by a leasehold interest.","We have - in the lease we have a right to purchase at fair market value the ground under those buildings in 10 years. But you wouldn't - to come up with a per square foot number you would need to add what you believe the fair market value of the land is.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Owen. I guess just then in terms of turning to - back to 399 Park and you talked about, I think you said a million square foot of proposals on the lower floors, where you have that 250,000 square foot block, where it sounded like you were getting close with you know, one financial tenant, but you didn't have an NOI yet for that block.","Can you just talk about how that discussion is going? Is that tenant still an option for all the space and you know, how much I guess from a timing standpoint you think it might take to get actual - you know some leasing done for that block?","Owen Thomas","I will answer the question and then let John Powers you know, chime in. So we have tenants who are looking for 250,000 square feet, we actually have a proposal out with a tenant who would actually after trying - get us to take some other space back from another tenant, so they would be larger than 250,000 square feet and then we have a number of tenants who are looking for a floor or a floor plus.","So you know the floors that we have available are around 70,000 square feet, so we think tenants are looking for 100,000 square feet, so they would be a floor and a half. I am not smart enough to handicap the physical timing of a lease signing. We are confident that we will have a significant portion of the low rise - of this building leased before the year is over, and that there will be income on this space hopefully by the end of 2019. John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","John Powers","We certainly would hate to break the block because it's a great block and we have people looking at it, but at some point we have people interested in single floors or two floors and we're going to have to do one of the deals and that's probably going to happen very quickly.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. And good morning. I guess just sticking with Santa Monica Business Park. So now you've got Colorado Center, Santa Monica to get Business Park. I mean how do you think about your desire to grow even more in L.A. at this point or do you feel like now you can digest for a while and see how things play out and how do you think you fit in strategically in that market versus the competition now as a landlord?","Doug Linde","So let me let me start with just sort of a real estate perspective Jamie, okay. So you know, when we bought the Colorado Center investment in July of 2016, what was so attractive to us about that investment was that it was our kind of property, meaning Boston Properties kind of property in that these were larger buildings that were leased to or could be leased to larger corporate users who we hope would be the kind of companies that would - that we would want to see grow.","And the Santa Monica Business Park fits that same glove. So the park is you know, just over a million one of office space and 15 tenants occupy 920,000 square feet of that space. So it's a very similar kind of a profile to Colorado Center and it really fits with the way we as an organization want to build our business.","So just sort of foundationally that's what we like so much about these two assets and I think it's pretty significant that in two years we have you know, as Owens said, we're now you know 20 plus percent, 24% owner of the competitive office supply in Santa Monica, which is a pretty significant way to enter that marketplace.","I think it's a little premature at this point to talk about additional growth. Let us divest this particular purchase and put the two together and work these assets.","Owen Thomas","Yeah. And. Jamie just to add to what Doug said, look we remain committed to have Los Angeles be one of our five major regions. However we're not going to encumber ourselves with a fixed timetable to do so, we are going to grow with assets that we make - we think make sense for the company and also with assets where we think we're going to make money on the acquisitions.","So we're going to be disciplined. We're going to be careful. You know, it took us two years following Colorado Center to find Santa Monica a Business Park. We've been patient. We've been disciplined. We couldn't be more excited to be making this particular investment, we think it fits perfectly for the reasons that Doug described. And going forward we're certainly going to look at new investments, but we're going to do it with the same discipline and care that we've been doing since we started in L.A.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just, maybe talk about potential timing if you were to bring in a partner and I think you mentioned an airport redevelopment and also public transit access. Just the timeframe of when all of those come together?","Doug Linde","So let me talk about the real estate and let Owen talk about the capital side. So the Santa Monica Business Park is a 47 acre parcel and [indiscernible] the Santa Monica Airport. The Santa Monica Airport is slated at this point to be decommissioned sometime around 2028. That means that that enormous parcel is going to be re adapted to some other use.","We expect it will be public uses not commercial uses, but as part of that process we are hoping and again we have not had one conversation with anybody in Santa Monica, the public, the community, the city council because it's way too premature to do that.","But we hope that at some point there will be a conversation about how the redevelopment of the Santa Monica Airport and the 47 acre site that we now will own and feed by that point because will help purchase the ground and how we think about changing and thinking about how it could be reconstructed and reconfigured. You know, going forward you know over the next decade or so.","So we're really excited about the long-term potential to do something here, not the short term potential. You know, when you guys do your tour in 2018 and you do the tour in 2021, you're not going to see a lot of changes. Because you know we recognize that all the buildings are leased, that there are tenants in the buildings, they are growing tenants.","The city of Santa Monica has a long way away from getting that airport back and there - it will have been very few if any conversations with the community with the public officials with the tenants with the neighbors et cetera. So this is all going to be a long-term prospect, but it's a 47 acre parcel in the heart of Santa Monica and it's got a great highway access to the Fed [ph].","Owen Thomas","And Jamie on capital, you know, clearly there are equity capital providers that are interested in this property and we are considering bringing in a partner and we could do that by the time that we close or could be afterward. But it's something that we're considering.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bowman","Hey it's Michael Bowman here with Manny. Mike and Doug you both sort of talked about a lot of leasing all coming towards the end of '19. A lot of the efforts that you've been working on development and lease up redevelopment.","Mike you also mentioned this lease accounting that's going to knock 2019 FFO by $0.04 to $0.06. I guess at what point do you start looking at consensus, right now assuming at about 695, about 10% growth.","You should be annualizing, call it you know, close to 660 by the end of the year. I mean, is there a gap between how you're thinking about that trajectory going to 2019 relative to where the street mindset is currently?","Doug Linde","So Michael, this is Doug. We have not spent a lot of time thinking about what the street numbers are for 2019. We're obviously in the third quarter of the year, we - you know, we provide our guidance. We have been providing our development outflow and our expectations of when those dollars will come into the income and the income statement and beyond the balance sheet in service.","And that's where the variability of our numbers are, and the question will be how far into '19 that stuff actually you know, impacts that the year. So as an example you know, we have up the Akamai building which we announced a year and a half ago, that's going to be delivered in the fourth quarter. Is it going to get delivered on October 1st or is it going to get delivered on you know, December 15. It's a big deal in terms of what the actual results will be for 2019.","So until we get a little bit closer to understanding the actual in-service date for the developments that are coming online, it's hard for us to - with great accuracy provide a 2019 number, which is why we are - we haven't obviously provided one yet and we probably won't until the third quarter.","Michael LaBelle","And I think you know, the leasing at 399 makes a big difference as well. The timing of - you know, as we sign these leases we will get better visibility as to the exact timing of when that rent is going to start. And that's obviously a lot of states and a lot of growth that is going to come. So at this point, we're not clear whether it'll be you know, at the beginning of '19, the end of '19, how much square footage is when and where, but that will become - as I said more visible to us as time goes on.","Michael Bowman","I'm just thinking about a step function, right. If you're running, it's called a buck fifty two a buck 55 between the first and second quarter based on your guidance for the back half of the year, as call it a buck 65 quarterly. As you think about next year I guess when is the next step up material or should the street be thinking that that buck 65 holds for the first couple of quarters.","And then you sort of get a bigger hockey stick towards the end of the year. Because I do think - what I hate to happen is for another year of guidance comes out and it's like - it's below the street again?","Michael LaBelle","With the biggest increase towards the back half of this year, I mean, you pointed out a good thing. I mean our FFO for the back half of the year is going to be higher than the first half of the year. And the biggest increase of that is coming from the development pipeline that is coming into service.","So we get Salesforce Tower obviously, every quarter they are taking on additional floors and we've got other tenants that we have signed leases in that building that are going to be taking on additional spaces.","So we've provided some of that information in our disclosures to you, as that kind of builds up. And then we also have the two residential buildings that are leasing up you know, in the back half of '18 and then through '19. So you know, that helps as well.","You know, the same store portfolio has some growth. In the back half of the year you'll see - you know, in the second quarter you're probably going to see another negative same store comparison to prior year because of 399.","But as we get into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see that improve on a comparative basis. And as Doug said, we're not really prepared to give 2019 guidance today. But as we go through the year we'll continue to provide insight on our calls as we see that.","Michael Bowman","Right. And next on the Santa Monica, on the yield that you've quoted mid to high threes is that an initial cash going in or is that a gap. And then can you give at least some details around the ground lease in terms of you know, what is the ground lease expense and as we start to think about sort of the expected yield on that purchase of the land?","Michael LaBelle","So just a couple of things. You're not going to like all the answers I give you, but that's okay. So the yield that Owen quoted were past yield. So they had not had GAAP impacts at all. And so he said you know, in the mid to high threes going to the sixes over five years. Those yield included the cost of the ground rent embedded in it.","And so when we figure out the capital structure and all the accounting issues associated with how we need to treat this stuff, we will provide better disclosure on the various components that are in our package. But we're there yet. I mean, this thing has been going quickly and literally you know, signed our contract with Diego [ph]","Michael Bowman","Right. I'm just thinking that land per square foot costs are going to be pretty elevated in that basis and so the market value of the land, you know, from a yield perspective, the cash yield perspective I got to imagine is well below that 3% range?","Michael LaBelle","No, it's actually not. You know, that you're thinking about it in the wrong way. The way the ground leased currently is structured, it's pretty expensive ground lease, and when that ground lease goes away we think the yield will be enhanced actually.","Michael Bowman","Even though you have to pay market value for the land?","Michael LaBelle","Yes.","Michael Bowman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of a little bit more detail sort of the NOI bridge going into '19 and '20, if you look at sort of the buildings that are maybe key components of the bridge, obviously 399 Park and you mentioned there's some variability in timing. Can you talk about sort of visibility in lease up potentially at 611 Gateway and maybe Embarcadero?","Doug Linde","Yes. So our visibility at Embarcadero Center is very strong. We have you know, a lot of proposals that we're working on, a lot of leases that are in negotiation and so we're very comfortable with the expectations that we've set on in terms of what Embarcadero Center is going to contribute.","611 Gateway. We've actually - I would say we've been very measured in our view on what's going to happen there. And so we've - you know, our perspective has been that we've been leasing somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 square feet a year and assuming that that pace is kept up well, you know, we'll be where and we need to be by the end of 2020 on that one.","The fundamental driver at this point of all of our \u201coperational\u201d occupancy increase is at 399 Park Avenue, everything else effectively has really gotten committed and on the margin that's where you know, where the big uncertainty is in terms of actual leases being signed relative everything - everything else in the portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then maybe just sticking to New York. You know, we've obviously - you've quoted a very robust private market with cap rates holding up. But many names focused and - on New York still traded pretty big discounts to NAV.","Maybe gives you a sense of you know, where are we - have you seen a move in cap rates for any - for certain types of assets within the New York market? And just related to that you also referenced a comment about capital allocation and buybacks, maybe just give us some thoughts around that as well? Thank you.","Doug Linde","Well, on the private equity market for real estate, we try to spend time on this call every quarter trying to demonstrate that Class A buildings in our core markets are trading - you know the per foot vary based on the rents, but the cap rates are generally in the fours. They are usually in the low fours for buildings I assume that have some lease up or some - that are leased below market and are there in the high fours.","But that is generally been consistent and we didn't see a change this quarter and there are actually a number of other deals that I didn't mention that we hear are either under agreement or becoming committed that are going to also mirror that cap rate. So my expectation is next quarter I'm going to be quoting to you again three or four deals that are going to be you know, cap rates in the four. So I think the market remained strong.","Your point and question on capital allocation, you know, we are doing - as I said in my remarks, we think our best use of capital today is the new pre-lease development that we're launching and value added acquisitions. You know, our development pipeline is at $3.5 billion, its 82% pre-leased. So it's been materially derisk and also as I mentioned our development pipeline is currently priced at around a 7% yield.","I talked about the Santa Monica investment generating over a six yield in five years. You know, our stock does traded discount NAV and depending on how you think about valuing the development pipeline and by the way we give you some data on how we think you should do that, but we see our stock trading in the low fives, you know, from a cap rate perspective. So that's why I made the remark that we think a better use of our investing capital is the development and the value added acquisition.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler","Hi. Its Jordan Sadler here. I wanted to touch base on SNBP [ph] one more time, going in cash flow yield is quite low. But it seems based on these ramps and the potential to the purchases of the land in 10 years that the unlevered IRR could be pretty high relative to what you'd expect for something in this type of a market, supply constrained market.","I'm curious what you think the IRR would look like and then maybe any commentary on what the competition for this asset look like and why you guys were the right buyer, as opposed to you know, some of the cheaper sources of capital out there?","Owen Thomas","Yeah. Look, I think the IRR was attractive to us relative to the other investments that we've looked at in West L.A. and frankly across the country. So we were very comfortable with the IRR on this investment.","And look, we think is a very attractive property. We think it was a great fit for Boston Properties for all the reasons that Doug and I have described. There's no doubt it was competitive and you know, we won an auction and you know there's a lot of speculation about who the other bidders were that you'd probably read as we have. And so I assume that that is the case.","Doug Linde","And just - I'll just give you sort of a general comment on IRR Jordan, which is that, we have been very disciplined and frustrated by the degradation of returns that has occurred in the overall acquisition market in terms of where people have been prepared to pay for things over the last couple of years and we just haven't been able to participate.","And our view is that you know, most people have been purchasing assets that are IRR that are in the low sixes. And clearly we have not been participating in that part of the sales market. We hope that this is going to be significantly better than that.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And then regarding 3 Hudson, I haven't heard a lot of follow up commentary on it, is a start or an anchor tenant and then a start there imminent. Can you talk about your investment and your expected return there?","Doug Linde","So we are - just to be clear on 3 Hudson Boulevard. This is one where we have not signed a commitment, we have an NOI and we're negotiating a commitment. So we are not prepared to provide as much detail as what we've been talking about in Santa Monica.","We're clearly in the market for tenants and we would not commence the vertical development until we secured an anchor commitment. Jon, do you want to provide any more color on that?","Jon Lange","Just so they like - that we really like the site you know, its north of the Hudson Yards a little bit, right on the 7 train and it's really on three avenues with 34 Street 11th and Hudson Boulevard. So you had a lot of light now. So we really like - we really like the site.","Doug Linde","And our yield requirements are you know in the range of what we are seeking in all of our other rigs - in all of our other regions.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And then last question, just on construction cost, you guys obviously have quite a bit of development underway and are committing to incremental development, could we talk about what you're seeing in construction cost escalation, post-tariff escalation, in other cost labor obviously and how you guys are mitigating those rising costs?","Jon Lange","So Jordan, the pre-tariff world, we were seeing escalation of between 3% and 5% on all of our projects across all of our regions. But it differed by the particular trade. So in one reason it might have been concrete and another reason it might have been curtain wall and a third reason it might have been mechanical electrical.","What we do when we are building our budgets for our developments, when we are quoting rents, which we have to live with, is that we build an escalation into all of those jobs and generally depending upon the market we're building an escalation between 4% and 6%. So we sort of have - we take a little bit more conservative scope and then we also build in you know change order contingencies and things like that that give us a little bit more in the way of \u201cleg room\u201d for things that could happen.","We don't think that on the margin the increases in the - mostly steel, not aluminum tariff that could occur will impact those escalations any more than what's currently in the market today.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. I guess a question for Michael LaBelle on the balance sheet and you sort of talked about the funding and the debt funding and sort of leverage levels not really moving. Could you just sort of walk us through kind of where you are to kind of net debt to EBITDA is today, kind of walk us through the balance of the debt funding, some of the new projects that maybe haven't started yet, but are committed and sort of where do you see that balance sheet pro forma and maybe I guess three years from now, how do you sort of see the leverage numbers changing?","Michael LaBelle","So right now we're at 6.8 net to debt to EBITDA and about $3.5 billion development pipeline, $2 billion is funded, so that's in the debt portion and its generating effectively zero today. So we've got another $1.4 billion of fund and then Doug described another $1 billion plus or minus of other new developments that we're working on. And you know, we'll see how we capitalized Santa Monica Business Part.","But you know, as you kind of look at that, I think that in the next quarter or two we may tick up a little bit, but then we're going to come down and as all the cash flow comes in from the development it's going to deliver us. And I feel very confident that we will be in kind of that 6.5 to maybe six and three quarters, plus or minus kind of on a pro forma basis after we get through this.","Now obviously a lot can change over the next three years because there's going to be other opportunities, we haven't things like that. But our goal is to make sure that we have enough you know, balance sheet to kind of keep our net debt to EBITDA from going above 7 times actively and that's how we're kind of managing things.","And you know, we think about as we look at new investments, do we want to bring in a partner not to that investment because it will enable us to further our dollar effectively without coming back to the equity markets.","Our view right now everything that we have on our books, that we think we could start, including the acquisition we just announced, we can do without raising equity and we can maintain our net debt to EBITDA below that seven times, which we're very comfortable with.","Doug Linde","You know, Steve just to add onto that. So we want to have the flexibility on our balance sheet to do things like the Santa Monica Business Park acquisition, which is a $600 plus million acquisition without having any concerns. And so what we're actually doing right now and we actually are about that one will be in the market relatively soon, because we are thinking about how we can better fund our developments and use third party capital to do that.","And so when we bake these cakes and we can demonstrate you know, the strength of the cash flows from these assets, bringing in a capital partner to participate in those assets. You know, early on the project is probably something that we would consider doing and are going to consider doing on selective basis is largely to maintain the financial flexibility that we want to have so that we can do other things, without going\u2026","Steve Sakwa","And I guess to maybe - to go back to Owens point earlier about, maybe tax efficiency. I mean, it sounds like maybe selling partial or whole buildings that are older vintage, maybe not as tax efficient, is it may be better or more efficient to sell some of the newer developments where you created gains and take some of those off the table with a higher cost basis?","Doug Linde","I think it's most efficient to bring a partner into a development that we haven't started yet or that we're just at the initial stages of starting because then we don't have to worry about a basis issue in terms of where we are trading and we can you know basically capture the value creation that we've done in terms of either getting promotes or getting you know \u201cstoked equity\u201d [ph] for land value that we've created and things like that that provide us with financial flexibility without having to talk of.","Steve Sakwa","Got it. Okay. And then I guess just on the Boston side. I know you spent a little time talking about the roll down in New York, I guess it was pretty clear was it the GM building. Just - there was a huge uplift I guess in the Boston\u2026","Doug Linde","Yes, it was up\u2026","Steve Sakwa","And I realize they're kind of older, but can you just maybe describe that again?","Doug Linde","Yeah. That was so last quarter, we mentioned that we took back space from Microsoft prior to their lease expiration. We did determination with them and their lease terminated on December 31 and we released about 100,000 square feet of 120,000 square feet of space in Cambridge to another tenant and the roll up was enormous, it was you know more than 64% because that actually was brought down by some of the other deals muffin. I think - I don't remember what I said last quarter, I think it was close to a 120% increase on that basis.","Steve Sakwa","Got it. Okay, thanks. That's it from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning there. Just two questions from us. The first is just thinking about L.A. and the amount of time Owen you mentioned two years since the initial foray there. Right now you own the asset or you will own it outright. Your thoughts on bringing in a JV partner versus all the time and effort to find just one, you know, just the second deal, why you split that up if it's been just such a difficult market to put capital in.","You guys certainly have the balance sheet and it also sounds from what you've described like there's a lot of upside in this asset. So why would you guys bring in a partner versus you know, keeping all the economics for yourself and also just leaving the fact that you work so hard just to get that second deal?","Owen Thomas","Yeah. Look, Alex its great question. I think I would - it goes back to what Michael LaBelle was talking about a minute ago, which is spreading our precious equity dollars further. You know, we did not want to increase the leverage of the company. Mike described it as seven times net debt to EBITDA, so we want to be careful with our equity and we are selling some non-core assets and you know, we're certainly thinking about bringing a partner in on this particular deal and that would be a driver.","Michael LaBelle","I think that you know, obviously if you bring in a JV partner thus the percentage of our NOI that comes from L.A. would not be as great as it would otherwise be, but it doesn't impact our market position. Our market position and how we operate in the market is if we own the whole thing that it enables us to really be a stronger market participant.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is going to what JPMorgan is doing, you guys have the MTA site - if recollection there were some issues here around property tax or how the - you know, the asset would be handled once it's transferred from sort of public use to private developer use.","But does - what you know, Jamie is doing next door. Does that impact the timeline in your thinking for redeveloping the MTA site or the complications inherent in that make it a different timeline than you'd otherwise have if it were a straight up deal?","Michael LaBelle","Yeah. No I- Alex, there's no question what JPMorgan is doing we think improves the prospects for our MTA site. We're still in the middle of an entitlement process which will take you know, a year plus to accomplish. And that's really driving our timing.","But there's no question that the JPMorgan activity is helping that particular sub-market in New York.","Owen Thomas","Jon, is there anything else you'd like to add to that?","Jon Lange","No, I think that it. It's probably more than a year plus going through Europe and the whole process we're in. But dislike it better.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Alan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. On Santa Monica Business Park, just given the going in yield versus the cost of that 4%, can you just walk us through how that's accretive this year, is it funded with the line and are there any one time JV fees that you're factoring in?","Doug Linde","We kind of assumed that it would be funded at a kind of a weighted average cost of debt versus a you know partial mortgage debt, partial line, because we don't - we haven't determined exactly how we're going to do it. But you know, the rents in the market are - in the building are below market.","So on a GAAP basis we do fair value lease accounting, so that increases the GAAP yield on this thing by bit. And in addition the ground lease we have to do capital lease accounting for that. So instead of expensing ground lease rent, we have interest expense and that modifies a little bit as well with the kind of FFO expense of that is versus what the actual ground lease expense is. So it's really those two things, in addition to the you know typical kind of FAS [ph] 13 you know, from rent bumps that are in there that are impacting the - making the gap yield be higher than the cash yield.","John Kim","Okay. So accretive to FFO, but not necessarily?","Doug Linde","Not initially cash, but as Owen described, a good portion of the space that is currently not income producing is contractually leased and we just haven't had those leases start yet. So the cash yield should increase fairly quickly as those tenants take occupancy of their space and they start paying rent.","John Kim","Okay. And then just purely from a cash flow perspective, I know there's been different opinions on this. But it seems like it would be difficult for an acquisition with going in the yield of 3% to 3.5% going to 6% after five years to match what you're doing on your development pipeline, devolving into 7 and 7.5 with minimal risk given the lease up. What is your response to that just purely from a cash flow perspective?","Doug Linde","Well, first of all this property is 94% leased. Now our developments, we do have substantial pre-leasing, but its 82%. We also have to build a building. So there's you know, construction, prophecies that have to occur and there's a timing delay, whereas we bought the Santa Monica Business Park, we have the income as soon as we closed, so that's the delta.","John Kim","And just one final question on Dock 72, how much of your leasing is being impacted by WeWork, effectively competing with you for enterprise tenants?","Doug Linde","I don't believe that we're \u201ccompeting\u201d with WeWork for tenants. In fact, interestingly there are some tenants who I think we see as being better suited to WeWork initially and to the extent that they're \u2013the experiment if they want to call it that of having an outpost in Brooklyn works they will - they actually be tended to. You know, we would take advantage of growing in the Park. So I think where we look at it is a very cooperative relationship. Jon, I don't if you have anything to add on that.","Jon Lange","No, I think that's it. I think its cooperative. We're very excited that WeWork is undertaking its build out now and we think that occupancy probably before the end of the year the amenities will all be done. And certainly the building will show a lot better than, that it does now. It looks terrific now, but with people in it and the amenities, I think it's going to be special.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Regan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Regan","Hey. Good morning, guys. Quick follow up on 3 Hudson, just order of magnitude how large would the pre-lease need to be there to kick off construction?","Doug Linde","Jed, we don't want to pin ourselves down to a specific percentage. It would have to be significant.","Jed Regan","Got it. And just couple of follow ups on Santa Monica Business Park. Can you give how much - what's the average remaining lease term in that project and there any big expected move outs coming up and then can you talk a little bit about snapshots [ph] occupancy in the campus?","Doug Linde","I can't give you off the top of my head the average lease expiration date for the whole campus. Snap is in about 300,000 square feet and they have must take option. I think that goes to you know close to 400,000 square feet. There are - there are a couple of other larger tenants with near term expirations, meaning like 2020, 2021.","And at this point, we don't assume that anyone is certainly going to walk out of the project. We think that the project is been a great home for everyone who's there. You know, we'll have to determine whether or not the rent levels that we're going to try and charge are going to be appropriate and conducive to people stay. But we're going to be aggressive about trying to maintain occupancy and maintain tenants and we are hopefully finding ways for our tenants to grow on the park.","Jed Regan","Okay, great. And then, I think I heard that there's not really any significant incremental capital spend plan for that project in the near term and that you can't get at the feet position buyout before 2028 are both those accurate statements?","Doug Linde","I think we are - our focus on capital in the short term is to make sure the buildings work really, really well, meaning that all of the systems and the structures of the buildings are competitive, appropriate and up to first class conditions.","So my point being, we're not going to move forward with a 'revitalization, recapitalization' of the building from an aesthetic perspective in the short term. We don't know what we will do over the long-term. And there you know, the expectation is that we will purchase the fee when the fee days are - you know is contractually allowed to be purchased which is about 10 years. I am sure we will have a conversation with the owner of the land before that and find out what their motivations are and their desires are and if we can work something out before that that would be great.","Jed Regan","And you're not - you're not underwriting any up-zoning potential specifically for that project?","Doug Linde","We are - our perspective was that we underwrote this assuming that what you see is what you get and that we over a long, long time may be fortunate enough to find some ability to change the way the buildings are configured, the current usages, but that's going to be a discussion that we have had.","We've spent literally zero time thinking about and will be much more involved with the city of Santa Monica, the constituencies you know, locally the tenants, the community, et cetera, and we would - we have no interest in getting out in front of that.","Jed Regan","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just another one on Santa Monica, can you give us any color on the magnitude of the mark-to-market on the in-place rents at that asset?","Doug Linde","I don't think we're quite ready to do that. Again, we have some initial numbers. I guess, I'd ask you to triangulate. So we told you what the initial cash return were. We told you what the returns are going to be look like in five years. Mike said it was going to be positively accretive.","Michael LaBelle","And 60% of the uplift more or less is coming from rents that have been signed that are not paying yet, so.","Blaine Heck","Okay. Fair enough. We can do that\u2026","Michael LaBelle","That is the five years at least.","Blaine Heck","Okay. And then maybe one for Mike on the same store NOI growth, for the past several quarters, I think the straight line adjustment has been a pretty significant negative between GAAP and cash same store NOI and increased even more this quarter. Can you just comment on whether we should expect that to unwind at some point as we see free rent burn off or is there something else going on there?","Michael LaBelle","I don't think there's anything unusual going on, you are saying the same store is - the spread between cash and GAAP is increasing?","Blaine Heck","Yeah, it seems that it has been a bigger negative to the cash number as we looked at it this quarter. So it seems like there's - there might be some pre run in there that, I am not sure\u2026","Michael LaBelle","I mean, I would say of our non-cash rents we have about $20 million that is kind of fair value rent and basically the rest of it is free rent that will burn off over the next year or two.","Blaine Heck","Are there I guess, are there any large leases in there that might have been driving that free rent number up that you know in that, that's going to burn off and we're going to see a bit of a boost to the cash same store number?","Michael LaBelle","Well, I think yeah, I mean, there's the leasing that we did at 100 Fed [ph] is not cash paying yet, that was over 200,000 square feet of space. The stuff that we're doing at 200 Clarendon, many of those leases are in free rent periods. You know, that's leasing that we've done in the last 12 months. That is just kind of getting into our numbers now and in this year and so its free rent associated with that.","And then in Cambridge some of the leases that we had, like the one that Doug described and I described is in a free rent period in 2018 and we did some blending extends in San Francisco and also in Cambridge that we have to wait until the natural lease expiration in '19 and '20 for those things to you know, turn into cash. So those are some examples.","Blaine Heck","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And this concludes the question and answer portion. I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Owen Thomas","That concludes all our remarks. Thank you for all your time and attention.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day."],"3683":["Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 24, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arista Joyner - Investor Relations Manager","Mortimer B.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties' Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bostonproperties.com.","An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Tuesday's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. The company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements.","Having said that, I'd like to welcome Mort Zuckerman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. I feel compelled to inform you that this is -- my name is Mort Zuckerman and, as we say, I approve this message. We are calling you and speaking to you from Massachusetts and New York, neither of which is a swing state.","I do want to talk to you a little bit about the economy, first of all, because we have been, as many of you may know, kind of very cautious about the economy for quite a number of years. And that caution still remains for a fundamental reason, which is that, for the first time in American history, we are looking at a transformation in the nature of employment in our economy. It has tilted in the direction of a part-time, low-wage nationwide workforce. A full 50% of the jobs created since the recession began have been part-time and their pay is inadequate to enter the middle class. In fact, if you sift through all the numbers, virtually all the net jobs created during the Obama administration have been part-time jobs, leaving millions of people trapped in jobs they would have left in better times. But in this uncertain economic climate, companies feel it's risky to take on people on a full-time basis so they are creating vastly more low-wage part-time jobs. Yes, some people are finding work, but if you look at the numbers in terms of personal disposable income, it is growing at the rate of about half of what it has typically been a couple of years back. What it means is that people are settling for any paycheck they can get.","Working part-time is obviously preferable to not working at all, but millions know that a \"20 hour a week\" job really makes it tough to pay the bills. In fact, according to Neil Irwin in The Washington Post, the average compensation for the year has only been about $0.59 a week in terms of increases.","Now we are continuing to sort of look at this, but it -- really, we see that virtually everyone below the 90th percentile is still falling in terms of real incomes and the net job increases are really, really distressing and almost nominal. And we are -- what we are having is a -- in a sense, a real, real change in the nature of employment in this country. And nobody knows what the consequences of this. I'll just tell you this: In -- there's an uncomfortable gut feeling in the American public that the American dream is receding. 1\/3 of Americans now identify themselves as lower class or lower middle class, according to the Pew Research Center, up from 1\/4 just 4 years ago. So this is one of the more troubling statistics, based on the income inequality that underscored the middle class squeeze.","And this really is -- does affect everybody in the economy and it is not something that we have really been able to find a solution to. There are a lot of people writing about it, there are a lot of people commenting about it. We're in the midst of a political campaign in which the economy is a major issue, but the reason why it's a major issue is that we are over 4 years into what is a recession that has really not been -- the back of which has really not been broken yet despite the most stimulative fiscal and monetary policy in our history. So we have to look at this and hope that it's going to sort of gradually pull itself back to a different kind of economic energy. But for the moment, we are still remaining very cautious.","Now having said that, I must say that we have, as a company, been able to -- a, because in part we anticipated this; and b, because we've always been fairly conservative in terms of our financing, we have been able to, we think, really manage our way through this and continue to do relatively well. This goes back to our fundamental strategy which we have followed from the earliest days of this company of really focusing in on what we call, in a simple way, A buildings in A locations. It's not just a casual commentary. It is because we have found, and it has been absolutely reinforced by the experience we've had over the last several years, that in difficult times where rents do go down, a lot of tenants will move into the best buildings because the rent is somewhat lower, and therefore, their occupancy stays at much higher levels compared to a lot of other real estate. And that has been, in fact, our experience.","Now one of the major items that I would like to address with you is the fiscal cliff here, and what might happen if that fiscal cliff does in fact turn out to be a cliff, that would be a very, very serious blow to the level of -- not only of the economy but of business confidence. So I think, if that doesn't get resolved, we are looking at a much more difficult time. But in the markets that we are in there are, virtually almost all in various ways, knowledge-based markets: San Francisco, Princeton, New York, Washington and Boston and Cambridge. And these are the markets, frankly, that have done relatively well. It doesn't mean that everybody in these markets has escaped the consequences. And I would say to you that a lot of the financial firms, in particular in New York, who are dealing with new regulations are facing cost cutting and reduction in employment. Nevertheless, by and large, these markets are doing quite well particularly, as I say, for us, in these -- the best of the buildings.","What -- one of the things that we have just done is to make a strategic investment in a development property in San Francisco. This is what we call the Transbay Tower, and it's going to be a 61-story, 1.4 million-square-foot building and over 1,000 feet tall. That will put it 200 feet above every other high-rise building or any other high-rise building in San Francisco. It's an extraordinary design by Pelli Clarke, Cesar Pelli, a building that we think will be an iconic building. And it is a project that has been approved by the city Planning Commission of San Francisco. And we have entered into a 50-50 joint venture with the Hines organization to purchase the land for approximately $139 per rentable square foot, and we anticipate buying this land in early -- the early part of 2013. The earliest building construction we'd commence is at the beginning of 2014, with an initial delivery sometime in the latter part of 2016. It is, frankly, the last full block site available in the financial district. It's right next to the terminal that's under construction. That will really be a fabulous adjunct to the building in terms of access and in terms of a city place that will attract a lot of people and will attract a lot of tenants. So this, again, is the kind of building that we believe fits into the core strategy of Boston Properties. And we're delighted to be in a partnership here with the Hines organization which also focuses on building outstanding buildings in unique markets. So we are really quite optimistic about this and we are looking forward to this development.","It will be a development, I might add, that will cost in excess of $1 billion. But it is in a market that is remarkably strong. As many of you may know, we have a great deal of real estate assets in the San Francisco area and in San Francisco. One of them is a building on Folsom Street, 680 Folsom Street, a building which is in the process of being completely rehabilitated and which is already well over 80% pre-leased. We also have the Embarcadero Center there, which is 3.4 million square feet of office space, right along the harbor and that is doing extremely well. And in fact, that is one of the strongest markets in the American -- office markets in the American economy for a very simple reason: in that it is the epicenter of the -- a world of new technologies and the online revolution that is affecting everything.","The online revolution, I might say to you, is going to have, on some levels, an effect on office usage because I think it's going to contribute to the ability of companies to shrink their office requirements. And this is something we're watching very carefully and are going to be very cautious in terms of what we do. The markets that we're in, however, to some extent, are -- I won't say immune to it but at least are doing relatively well in this economy: New York, as you know, which is still a financial center and a major financial center and will continue to be that, and so we're very comfortable with what we're doing in New York. But Washington has been an outstanding market for us. We have as close to full occupancy as you can have in all of the buildings there. The new buildings that we did were -- are extraordinarily successful. And in fact, if I may say so -- let me talk to you about both -- Transbay, which is the San Francisco project.","As I mentioned, it's an outstanding site. We have a partnership with an outstanding firm. It's an extraordinary building in a super location. But I do want to suggest to you that the execution of this deal demonstrated the depth and breadth of the Boston Properties team. We mobilized key personnel from 4 different regions, turned around a deal negotiation, due diligence, financial underwriting and preliminary document review and legal documentation and execution in less than 8 business days. So we are very proud of that and I think it was a constructive way to engage with our partners and colleagues in the Hines organization.","I'd like to mention at least one other thing, which is at -- the Urban Land institute, which every year considers hundreds of properties indeed throughout the world for the ULI international award of excellence. It is a high honor for any firm in the real estate business to have one of their projects selected. But this year, in a most highly unusual action, the Urban Land Institute selected 2 of BP's recent projects, Atlantic Wharf and The Avenue, for receipt of this award. We are really thrilled and indeed humbled by this recognition.","Another thing that I want to suggest to you is that the GSC -- GSA acts when it is appropriate to protect their occupancy status in a building. And they renewed its lease at 1301 New York Avenue for over 200,000 feet for 15 years. And we will provide you with more of the specifics of this, but it's consistent with our philosophy of aggressively seeking renewals of key leases before the lead expiration date is an issue, and this was clearly the case in this one.","But I will also point out that there is energy and life in the leasing markets, certainly in D.C. for our D.C. regional leasing meeting highlighted increased levels of activity in virtually all sectors of the market that we are in but especially in our Annapolis Junction project with the Gould family. This activity, coupled with the \"If you build it, they will come\" philosophy of NSA, resulted in a decision of the Goulds and BP to starting yet another building, a 140,000-square-foot building there for delivery in late 2013.","These are just a few of the highlights that I want to convey to you. And if that's okay, I'll just pass it on now to my colleagues.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the third quarter. I hope that -- I hope Mort's comments on the macro side didn't put people down too much because I think that the reality is that the business economy, which is what we all are dealing with, while it's not doing as well as anybody would like and it's probably doing less well right now than it was 2 or 3 quarters ago, it's still in pretty good shape and I think it'll -- well, as we talk this morning, you'll get a sense of how it's reverberating through our portfolio both from the positive as well as sort of some of the things that are slowing down a little bit.","You probably wouldn't be surprised to hear that our perspective on the overall leasing markets are that -- they're pretty flat. There's not a lot of urgency with regards to lease decisions right now. Leases expire every year, but the tenants that have those leases in front of them are really exercising an abundance of caution as they think about expanding and\/or making long-term decisions. I think the thing, though, that has struck us is that nobody has canceled any plans. We have not seen anything like what we were seeing in 2008, in 2009, with sort of an existential perspective with regards to the businesses that we consider our customers. It's really more of a pause, a wait and a -- wait-and-see.","I've spoken to you before about sort of one of the things that we track, which is venture capital investing. And way back when, in 2000, the D.C. commitments were running at about $22 billion per quarter. For the last year or so, they've been running between $6 billion and $8 billion per quarter, and this again was a quarter where they were closer to $6 billion than to the $8 billion and slightly down from where they were in the second quarter. But surprise, surprise, where are people investing money in new business formations? The Silicon Valley and San Francisco, the Boston-Cambridge market and New York City. So 3 of the most important markets for us are where the new businesses are going to be formed.","It's clear, as Mort said, that the growth in our markets, in -- certainly in the short and medium term is going to be driven by demand from technology and life sciences companies. And there is going to be this offset from employment reductions and productivity enhancements with regards to the space that's being used by the traditional financial services and professional service firms. And really what that's doing is it's really creating a sort of secondary organic supply in our markets. And it's important to sort of think about what the impact of that are over time particularly because it's going to be granular and sort of spread out through many buildings and the markets are going to have to deal with that.","We are, in fact, as Mort suggested, spending an awful lot of time thinking about how people are using space, the types of tenants that are going to be the winners and the growers on a going-forward basis, and thinking about how we spend our capital to both position our existing assets as well as change our portfolio so that we can be successful in a changing market. Now I do not want to suggest that we are in any way turning our backs on the traditional office user because, quite frankly, they still are the dominant user of office space, but we have to start thinking long and hard about how things are changing as we move forward.","And with this in mind, this is really I think the reason that our acquisition on -- at Folsom Street sort of makes a lot of sense hopefully to you and certainly to us. 680 Folsom is a 14-story glass structure. It's an old AT&T\/PacBell building with 15-foot floor-to-floor heights, but it's being totally gutted and brought back with 10-foot-6 brand-new windows. It's a 35,000-square-foot floor and it's exactly the kind of building that a mature technology company would be looking for if they could find that type of product in San Francisco. It is located in the heart of where the tech demand is and it's a very unique product because it's a grown-up building for a mature tenant.","It's leased to -- 85% of the building has been leased to Macys.com and Riverbed and it's going to be delivered in the first quarter of 2014, with a yield-on cost of around 6%. We are asking in the low 60s for the remaining space in the building, which effectively means that there is a pretty significant positive mark-to-market today on the leases that are in place. And as part of it, we're also acquiring a small site called 690 Folsom, which has a 22,000-square-foot structure. That's going to be redeveloped either into some retail space and\/or office space. We haven't quite figured that out.","This is the quarter where we talk about our 2013 estimates and our projections for the year, and Mike is going to be laying that out in a few minutes. So I thought, as I talk about the markets in our portfolio today, I would try and do it with a perspective on giving you a sense of the current activities that we are undergoing and how that's going to influence or is influencing our near-term projections.","Leasing across the portfolio for the quarter was just over 1 million square feet, which was quite frankly a drop from the second quarter. The second-generation numbers that you see in the portfolio statistics are pretty good from the perspective of sort of where the mark-to-markets are overall. But there are some pretty interesting things that I just wanted to explain within the individual markets.","So the first is that the San Francisco numbers, once again, have this -- a little impact of $90 rents. So there's about 11,000 square feet in that number where the rents are rolling off over $90-plus. And so if you eliminate that, then it -- the San Francisco numbers are actually positive 2.5% growth and 3.25% on a net basis.","In D.C., the numbers are a little bit skewed. There's about 16,000 square feet of space that we had to let at below market as part of a requirement to relocate about 16,000 square feet of tenants when we did the Bechtel transaction at the Overlook buildings of -- late last year. And if you -- and those rents rolled out to about $32 a square foot, which is probably about $8 or $9 below market. But that's where those tenants were currently paying and our obligation was to find space so they may continue them at the same overall rent. So if you pull that out of the equation, the D.C. numbers are actually positive 7.5% growth and 8.1% on a net basis.","And then in Boston, all the gains are really from Cambridge where we are now leasing space in the high 50s on a gross basis. If you sort of look at the whole portfolio on an entirety basis in terms of our mark-to-mark, it's pretty flat in '13, so that will talk to sort of Mike's same-store numbers as we move forward. And the whole portfolio is up, between 2% and 3%, as of today.","San Francisco and the Silicon Valley clearly are the strongest overall markets in the portfolio. The Silicon Valley, last quarter, had a little bit of a dip, but this quarter, the big-ticket transactions have come -- started coming back again. LinkedIn and Lab 126 both committed to 530,000 and 350,000 square feet of space. Samsung signed a lease for a new 365,000-square-foot development, which is pending approvals. Dell and Arista both took 150,000-square feet on some specular buildings that are being built by Irvine right now. And EMT took another 100,000 square feet of space.","Now the activity is really standard around Mountain View and Sunnyvale, Sta. Clara. So if you think about our portfolio and when it sort of gets to sort of what's going on with us, this year, we leased 2 of the 4 floors that we had available at 611 Gateway, which is in the North Peninsula, which is not strong a market. And while we are seeing some activity on that space, things are slow up there and we probably are not anticipating much in the way of revenue until the very end of 2013.","On the Zanker Road project in North San Jose, really, activity there has not really hit the same pace of acceleration that it has in the rest of the Silicon Valley. And we are studying those buildings and deciding whether or not it makes sense to basically re-skin those buildings, take them out of the services and\/or try and lease them at a -- as a discounted product. But one way or the another, there's probably not going to be much revenue from those buildings in 2013.","Our JV assets in Mountain View are actually doing very well. We've seen significant growth in rents there, as we've talked before. But those buildings are now being marketed for sale as the fund that those buildings are in with our 2 outside investors is coming to an end and it was the appropriate course of action to take. So we anticipate some sort of a decision as to whether those buildings are going to get sold before the end of the year.","In CBD. At Embarcadero Center, we're sitting about 96% occupied or leased. Again, we've done about 15 transactions a quarter and it's only totaled about 89,000 square feet this quarter. It was about 80,000 last quarter largely because we just don't have much in the way of space to lease. Our near-term opportunities are pretty limited. There are 2 full floors in EC 1 which are actually under lease negotiation, and those numbers will hit our 2013 commencements. And then we have 3 floors at the -- in the upper portion of EC 4. And there, it's interesting, demand is actually pretty limited. We are marketing that space in the high 70s and low 80s, and frankly that's the one segment of the San Francisco market, the high, high-end segment that is pretty slow right now. So all in all, we are anticipating a pretty modest increase in occupancy towards the end of 2013 from Embarcadero Center, but again, we're starting on a basis of about 96%.","Turning to Boston. Cambridge is obviously the strongest market we have seen. As I talked before, there are actually 6 buildings that are being built right now in Cambridge, totaling almost 1.8 million square feet in there, effectively 100% leased. And our problem, quite frankly, in Cambridge is that we are now 100% occupied. We've got 9,000 square feet of space that we have a transaction on in One Cambridge Center. And after that, the next expiration we're going to see is not until 2014 or 2015. So there's not, unfortunately, much we can do to improve our position in Cambridge, given how well we're doing, but that doesn't mean we haven't stopped thinking about it. We are starting to talk to tenants about 2015 and 2016 lease expirations. And remember that, during the later half of 2013, we're going to be bringing on the building that's connecting the 2 buildings that Google took a lease on, that's about 43,000 square feet, and as well as the 195,000-square-feet development that we are doing for Biogen at 17 Cambridge Center.","In the CBD of Boston, we did 3 more deals at Atlantic Wharf this quarter, about 51,000 square feet, and again have limited our ability to do much more because now that building is 100% occupied, literally 100%. We also signed our first lease at 100 Federal Street for the top -- one of the floors towards the top of that building where we are asking rents in low 60s. So we have 2 other floors in that building that are available. There's reasonable activity on both of them given that the size of those floors are about 30,000 square feet. If assuming we do a deal in the first quarter or the second quarter of 2013, rent commencement probably won't be towards the end -- until the end of '13 or early '14.","In the Back Bay, I think the big news of the quarter was that we signed a 330,000-square-foot lease at 101 Huntington Avenue. The good news is that we've covered all of our lease expirations for 2013 and 2014 there. The bad news is that the lease doesn't commence until 2015 because we have to build a space out for Blue Cross Blue Shield.","We continue to negotiate extensions for tenants that are expiring in the Pru Tower. We have 2 of those going on right now, so there won't be much in the way of occupancy gains there because those tenants will stay. And at -- over at Hancock Tower, we have about 40,000 square feet of uncovered rollover, but we're doing 2 more 2015 leased extensions. The first one was done this week for a full floor and there's a second one involving 4 more floors in the tower that should be done before the end of the year. The real major opportunity for us in the CBD of Boston now is at the low rise of the Hancock where the State Street lease is expiring in -- at the end of 2014. And we've actually begun to market that space both through traditional use as well as a bunch of technology tenants. And we think we found some ways to really change the image and the layout of those floors, given the configuration of the floor plan that would be very effective for an open user of a technology ilk, and we're pretty excited about what the prospects might be for either type of tenancy in that building.","The Boston suburban market is probably the market with our most exposure\/opportunity in the region. This is again an area where there is significant tenant demand in the form of tech and life sciences tenants but where, again, the decision making process just keeps being elongated and prolonged. We have about 700,000 square feet of availability in our Waltham\/Lexington portfolio and that includes the 100,000-square-foot lease that we have at A21 -- A123 on a company that was part of the energy department's opportunity to create a manufacturing for the Ferrari business for cars that hasn't gone so well. And we anticipate that we may be seeing some of that space back.","But again, in this market, everybody is just being very cautious, from a tenant perspective. We are in negotiations and have been in negotiations for a pretty long period of time with a 150,000-square-foot tenant in one of our buildings that's going to expand by 100,000 square feet. That expansion will occur in '13, '14 and '15, but the lease isn't done yet. We're in discussions with a life science company that wants to take an 80,000-square-foot building and take 50,000 square feet of that building and put an office and lab installation in it. That lease isn't done yet. We have 400,000 square feet of other proposals from tenants for between -- of sizes of between 40,000 and 80,000 square feet that we've -- that have sort of been out there since the early part of the summer, and those tenants just haven't made decisions. And we also have an RFP for a build-to-suit for a 220,000-square-foot technology company that has been looking for a new facility for the better part of 2 years, and we continue to work through that RFP portfolio.","So given the realities of the timing of these decisions, it's just -- it's a struggle to think that any of the leasing that we're going to do in Waltham is going to do much, other than for the very back end of 2013. And so it's just not going to have much in the way of an impact on our 2013 results, but we certainly expect it'll have lots of impact on our 2014 and 2015 results.","Looking at New York City. There, again, I think the leasing markets are sort of stuck in neutral. Availability overall in Midtown is about 12%, and there's just no visibility on large users. And I define large users as 300,000, 400,000 square feet or more. They really have much in the way of any growth objectives. There are certainly tenants that are looking around: Microsoft and Coach and L'Oreal are the ones that have been in the paper recently, with 2015 and 2016 lease expirations, but effectively it's really musical chairs for those companies. I think the one company that is growing and where there is an impact is Google, as they are certainly clearing out all the other tenants in 111 8th Avenue as those leases roll over. And that's clearly impacting the market in Midtown South, which as everyone knows is probably the strongest market right now in New York City.","We continue to make progress with our second law firm lease, which is 266,000 square feet at 250 West 55th, as well as the retail space. And we really expect that before the year is over, we will be 50% officially leased. As we move into '13, we're really going to be focusing our efforts on the remainder of the building, which are Floors 25 through 38, and those are really going to be geared towards single-floor and multi-floor tenants, tenants that are under 100,000 square feet. And we are now just starting to approach their leasing decision window. So the building's going to be opening some time in first or second quarter of '14, which is sort of right in the heart of where the leasing strategy should take us. So we're sort of gearing up to that.","At 399 Park, we had 150,000-square foot block, and we have now leased 134,000 square feet of that. And those were rents were in the mid-to-upper 90s, which is why you'll see a slight rolldown in the rents to add at in the New York portfolio, where the rents on the existing lease were just over $100 per square foot.","But our real exposure and our real opportunity is in the small space market, at 540 Madison and the new building at 510.","We continue to slug it out and do leases. We did another 7 leases of under 5,000 square feet in the pre-built suites that are in the portfolio. But this is a segment of the market that, again, it's all about business confidence and it's slow and steady. And I just wanted to give you a perspective on the high end of the market.","So back in 2007, there were 106 transactions totaling 2.2 million square feet of deals that were over $100 a square foot. In 2011, there were 45 deals totaling 750,000 square feet under that same $100-square foot starting ramp. Through October 1 of this year, there have been 28, totaling 442,000 square feet. Now the other thing to realize is that lots of those tenants are renewing or expanding in their existing premises. Of the deals that were involved a relocation, every single one of them was under 11,500 square feet, which is the reason that as we've thought about 510 Madison, we determined that the best chance for us to be successful at achieving rents well in excess of $100 a square foot is to do this pre-built suite program. The velocity has been frustrating. But we continue to move forward, we continue to seek tenants each and every week, each and every day. And we are convinced that the building will lease up at the rents that we pro form it. And that there is demand for those small tenants, it's just we're having to get an outside percentage of what is available in the market today.","Mort mentioned the lease that we did at 1301 New York Avenue. And it's sort of interesting because, even with the all the federal budgetary issues in D.C., it actually appears that our perseverance with the GSA is actually making progress. The lease that Mort described is a 15-year 200,000-square foot extension with the Department of Justice. And that's the deal we've been working on for the better part of a year. And additionally, out of Patriots Park, we believe we're going to receive a document from the GSA committing them to a 180,000 square-foot building in Reston for another 20 -- for a 20-year term beginning in the second quarter of 2013.","This is a lease that is a relocation of another defense group that is sharing services with the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is the other tenant in the other 2 buildings in Reston. So that should improve our occupancy in Reston by 5% and bring it to 98% by the end of the second quarter of 2013. Reston continues to be the outlier in terms of overall activity and premium rents in the northern Virginia and the Montgomery County suburbs. We continue to rent space in the mid-to-high $40s. In fact, we've actually done some deals that are in excess of $50 a square foot. And our availability there is really limited to some smaller blocks of space. Not much in the way of lease expirations in 2013 in Reston, so what do we do? We start to begin to work on our 2014 and our 2015 lease expirations. And we have one large one, it's about 250,000 square feet. It's a defense contract, so that is in Two Freedom Square. So We're working on that as we speak.","Reston, while Northern Virginia may have a concentration of defense-related government contractors, the Town Center really has a lot of technology and engineering, professional services and educational users. And those tenants are actually expanding as we speak. So we have 2 tenants right now that are looking at taking additional space from existing tenants that would like to get out of space in Reston to accommodate their growth.","We did complete the acquisition of the other Fountain Square buildings on October 4. So remember, we purchased a 50% interest in those 2 office buildings, totaling about 522,000 square feet as well as 242,000 square feet of retail space.","We are in control, on a day-to-day basis, of all operations, as well as leasing. And we anticipate purchasing the remaining interest in 2016.","So in the district itself, we are 96% leased. And what we have left over in the portfolio are some smaller suites or a floor here and there in 2210 Market Square North and 500 North Capitol, which actually just opened up about 2 weeks ago. There continues to obviously be an abundance of options for all kinds of users in the district and things are pretty slow. So what we've decided to do is sort of follow our course of success in New York City, and start to do some pre-built suites. And we are now building pre-builts, and a modest amount of them in both 2200 Pen, Market Square North and 500 North Capital. And we really hope that's going to increase the velocity of our leasing and our revenue generation in those buildings.","Not much is going to probably happen to improve overall velocity in D.C. largely because there just aren't any lease expirations in a big scale until 2015 and 2016. However, we happen to have one of those opportunities in one of those tenants. We are negotiating a lease of about 368,000 square feet, which is actually a little bit more than I said it was last quarter, because the tenant has gotten a little bit bigger. For our 478,000-square foot development at 601 Mad Avenue. And if we have a pre-lease commitment, we will start this building towards the end of '13 or early '14. And we anticipate also commencing on another 120,000-square foot building up in Annapolis Junction.","That's our 50-50 JV with the Gould family. It's a very small asset, $32 million in total. So our share is about $16 million. And that will be delivered in the fourth quarter of '13. And again, that's really focused on the demand from the NSA from Cyber Command and their private contractors in Fort Meade. And there's a pretty consistent flow of activity out there.","Just to sort of to come back and sum up. So in 2012, we acquired 100 Federal Street and Fountain Square and 680 Folsom. That's for a total of about $1.4 billion of committed capital. Mort described our investment in San Francisco in the Transbay Tower, and that's probably a 2017 revenue event. That's when rent will actually commence on that building. In 2013, we're bringing online 17 Cambridge Center and the Google expansion and the third building at Patriots Park.","In 2014, we have $137 million 359-unit apartment building in Reston Town Center, as well as the first revenue from the tenant leasing that we are doing at 250 West 55th Street. And if we, knock on wood, sign a lease on 601 Mad that building will be delivered in 2015 or early 2016. So I think it's fair to say that we, as a company, continue to find ways to attractively deploy capital even in the conditions and the challenges that Mort described from a macro perspective.","So we are thinking real hard about how we do that. At the same time, we are also reviewing the portfolio. And probably we will see some selective dispositions in 2013 as we rejigger and consider what the right profile of our assets and our capital should be on a going-forward basis. And we will continue to provide updates on that as we go forward. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody.","As you just heard from Mort and Doug, and Doug just went over pretty well, we continue to find accretive ways to invest our capital. In addition to making the 3 acquisitions that Doug just mentioned that really do fit well within our strategy, we also in the capital markets paid out some debt this quarter, about $250 million of debt, which had a high coupon of 6.4%.","And as we look forward to next year, we have $590 million of debt expiring that has average GAAP interest rate of about 6% and a cash interest rate of about 4.25%. We expect to refinance these loans upon maturity. And based upon current market rates, we will continue to lower our average borrowing cost.","On our development pipeline, which has a total investment of $1.8 billion, is now 59% pre-leased and it has about $550 million of equity left to spend. With cash balances of $1.2 billion, we have ample liquidity to fund that pipeline, as well as seek additional opportunities.","The credit markets have been very accommodating over the past quarter, with spreads continuing to come down especially in the public debt market. Our 10-year outstanding bonds are trading at a spread inside of 150 basis points. And we believe we could issue new 10-year unsecured debt today in the 3.25% to 3.5% area. The longer end of the credit curve is also active. And we can price a 30-year bond inside of 5%.","If you look at the mortgage market, it's really been a little stickier, with most of the life insurance companies having a really strong banner year and they're showing restraint in bringing down their pricing. However, the CMBS market had strengthened and is actually becoming more price-competitive. Most institutional mortgage opportunities are in the high 3s to low 4% range per coupon for a moderately-leveraged 10-year loans that are either in the life insurance market or the CMBS market.","Turning to our earnings results for the quarter. We announced funds from operations for the third quarter of $1.16 per share, that was $0.02 per share or about $4 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the variance was in our portfolio operations. Our revenues were up by about $2 million, which was spread across the portfolio, including the joint ventures. And our operating expense savings were about $2 million.","Now the vast majority of the expense savings related to the timing of spending, repair and maintenance dollars. So we expect to give most of the savings back in the fourth quarter. We also had savings in our G&A line item of just over $1 million, but that was offset by unbudgeted acquisition expenses of $1.1 million that related to the 680 Folsom Street and Fountain Square acquisitions.","This quarter, we did book the first installment of our historic tax credits related to the Atlantic Wharf residential development. This was in our budget. It totaled $2.9 million and it shows up in the Interest and Other Income line, which is why that line is a little bit higher this quarter than it was in prior quarters. We are going to book this amount annually in the third quarter of each year for the next 5 years. So it will not recur next quarter.","For the rest of 2012, we really don't project any significant changes to our budgets that we outlined last quarter. As I mentioned, we expect to give back most of the expense savings we enjoyed this quarter and project only $0.01 of the third quarter outperformance to or near to the full year. For the same-store portfolio, we're projecting the full-year 2012 to be flat to down 0.5% on a GAAP basis, and down 0.5% to 1% on a cash basis from 2011, and this is slightly better than our last projections from the revenue outperformance I just discussed.","We've managed to maintain roughly flat performance in the same-store, despite experiencing some very meaningful rollover at 111 Huntington Avenue, Patriots Park, 399 Park Avenue, Embarcadero Center and Gateway Center. And this is really a testament to the quality of these assets and their locations, as well as our leasing teams, to be able to minimize the downtime associated with these large lease expirations, especially in such a tough economic environment.","For the full year 2012, we're narrowing our FFO guidance range to $4.87 to $4.89 per share, and project fourth quarter funds from operations of between $1.22 and $1.24 per share. Our fourth quarter run rate is projected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Fountain Square that closed on October 4, and lower interest expense and debt extinguishment cost from our recent debt repayments, which will be offset by the tax credit income I just mentioned that won't recur in the fourth quarter.","I now want to spend a few minutes talking about our expectations and projections for 2013. We've been very, very productive this year. We added meaningful acquisitions to the portfolio and we purchased -- the completion of a portion of our development pipeline, both of which should result in stronger earnings in 2013. Next year, we will see the full year impact of 100 Federal Street and Fountain Square, which are projected to add $18 million to $20 million net of minority interest to our NOI. In the development pipeline, we just recently delivered 500 North Capitol Street in D.C. that Doug mentioned. We only own the 30% share of this building, and it's 82% leased. And in 2013, we will deliver 3 additional fully-leased projects: Patriots Park 2, that is leased to the DIA; 17 Cambridge Center, that is leased to Biogen; and the Cambridge Center Connector building that is leased to Google.","In aggregate, these 4 projects are projected to add approximately $9 million of incremental NOI to 2013.","We also expect to continue to benefit from lower interest expense with the combination of lower average debt cost, as we layer in lower rate financing and higher capitalized interest, with the addition of 680 Folsom Street to the development pipeline and the incremental funding at 250 West 55th Street. We project a reduction of year-to-year net interest expense of $10 million to $20 million. This projection, obviously, could be impacted by the timing or the size and the rate of any new financing we complete. But our model assumes that we refinance the $590 million of debt we have coming due with long-term financing in midyear 2013 at market rates.","So these positive items that I just mentioned, that aggregate $40 million to $50 million, are offset by a projected decline in the contribution of our joint venture portfolio from the termination of CBS at the GM Building. As you recall, last quarter, we terminated the CBS lease early and accelerated all of their remaining lease payments as termination income into the second quarter of 2012. We are not projecting any income from this phase in 2013, which results in a decline of revenue of $15 million in 2013.","We've seen interest in this space from global retailers and we fully expect to replace the CBS income. However, the timing is uncertain, as the states represents not only a unique opportunity but also a major decision for prospective tenants.","So the net effect of these items resulted in an increase of 2013 FFO of between $25 million and $35 million or $0.18 a share at the midpoint. There are other changes that will impact next year and I'm going to go through the detail behind our projections. But these are the most significant movers that are outside of our normal portfolio operations.","Our current occupancy rate in the portfolio is 91.6%. And with our CBD buildings at 96%, most of our opportunity is in our suburban buildings in Waltham, San Jose, Reston and Princeton. While these suburban markets have activity, the market vacancy rates are still elevated, so competition is tough and as Doug, noted, tenant decision-making is cautious.","If you look at our rollover exposure for the rest of 2012 and 2013, it's really relatively light and manageable, at only 5.5% of the portfolio. We're projecting modest improvement in our occupancy next year and we expect to average between 92% and 93% for the year. The same-store portfolio is projected to improve from occupancy gains and recent leasing in Cambridge at Atlantic Wharf, at 399 Park Avenue and Embarcadero Center.","Our 2 residential projects, both of which stabilized earlier this year are now maintaining strong occupancy in the mid-90% range and are also projected to show improvement year-over-year. We're projecting the same-store NOI to be up 1.5% to 2.5% on a GAAP basis. Now on cash basis, the portfolio would be up significantly, with the burn-off of free rent from some of the larger leasing activity that we had done previously, including 111 Huntington Avenue, at Cambridge Center, 399 Park Avenue, the Bechtel deal at Reston Overlook and Embarcadero Center IV.","We expect cash same-store NOI to be up 6% to 7% in 2013. And with the improvement in our cash NOI, we project stronger FAD next year as well. For the full year 2013, we expect our FAD to be $3.85 to $4 per share, which is approximately $0.55 per share or $90 million higher than 2012. Our non-cash straight-line rent and our fair value rent is projected to be $40 million to $50 million in 2013. And now this is down $50 million from 2012 and that reflects the conversion of free rent to cash rent and part of the improvement in our projected cash NOI.","Our Cambridge Hotel operated in line with our budget this quarter. It continues to show strong Revpar growth year-over-year, with a 16% improvement year-to-date over 2011. We project more moderate growth next year, and expect the hotel to contribute between $10 million and $11 million for 2013.","As I mentioned in the joint venture portfolio, the contribution will be hurt by the vacancy left by CBS at the GM Building. In addition, 540 Madison Avenue has 75,000 square feet of tenants expiring in 2012 and 2013. The transition time between leases at 540 Madison Avenue is expected to result in about $6 million of lower NOI in 2013. We project the FFO contribution from our joint ventures to be $110 million to $120 million, which includes non-cash fair value rental income of approximately $50 million. The joint venture contribution to our FFO is projected to be down $20 million to $30 million from 2012, primarily due to a temporary occupancy decline.","Our income from development in Management Services income will be impacted in 2013 by the completion of 3 major fee development projects. That includes 500 North Capitol Street, which delivered earlier this month; the NPR project, which we expect to complete in April next year; and the tenant improvement work for the DIA at Patriots Park that wraps up in early 2013. The decline in fee income year-to-year for these 3 projects is $4 million, which we don't expect to replicate in 2013. Our projection for income from development and management services is $24 million to $30 million next year.","We're projecting our G&A expenses to be relatively flat next year, with a 3% growth in compensation, offset by onetime severance items we incurred in early 2012. Overall, we're projecting G&A expense of $83 million to $86 million in 2013. And we project our interest expense, as I mentioned, to be lower in 2013, as we reduce our average debt costs with our refinancings and we have higher capitalized interest associated with development.","We expect to spend in excess of $400 million by the end of 2013 on our pipeline. Much of it relates to 680 Folsom Street and 250 West 55th Street, which will offset the impact of ceasing capitalization on the 2012 and 2013 deliveries.","Overall, we project net interest expense for 2013 of $385 million to $395 million, with capitalized interest projected to be $55 million to $65 million.","The other thing I want to mention is that next quarter, you will start to see an increase in our minority interest deduction due to the consolidation of our Fountain Square joint venture. So historically , our run rate for minority interest expense has been about $4 million annually. And we expect that to increase to $10 million to $12 million per year, to account for our JV partners' share of FFO Fountain Square.","So if you aggregate all of these assumptions together, it results in our projected 2013 FFO guidance range of $5 to $5.15 per share. Again, our guidance reflects an increase from 2012 of roughly $0.20 per share or approximately $35 million at the midpoint of each range. The improvement is from the positive impact of our acquisitions, development deliveries, interest expense savings and the same-store improvement I mentioned that, together, total $60 million to $70, million. Offset by the Anticipated $20 million to $30 million decline in our joint ventures and a modest decline in our fee income. We have not incorporated any additional acquisition, disposition or development activity in our projections.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum here with Gabe Hilmoe at UBS.","Guys, I'm a little curious about your, I'll call it, medium-term thoughts on the New York City market as it relates to whether you think there's going to be a pickup in net absorption, given the trend we've seen of the impact of Dodd-Frank as well as tenants becoming smarter about their space efficiency needs. And then on the flipside, with a couple new buildings coming into the picture over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years, is Manhattan over-hyped relative to the asset pricing that's occurring?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well let me take a shot at that. It's Mort. There is, undoubtedly, a review on the part of almost every major firm, particularly financial firms who are taking advantage of technology amongst other things to see how much space they really need. And most of them are heading in the direction of contracting their space. Nevertheless, I have to say that there are a lot of major companies in this market that are looking for huge blocks of space and looking to build their own buildings. Many of them are going to go into places like Hudson Yards on the west side of town. But frankly, I still think this is one of the great markets. It's still the center of finance. It is still the center of a lot of other kinds of activities. But particularly, it is a center for Midtown South. But it -- for the new online economy, the new Internet economy, all of that -- New York is going to be the -- it's probably second only to Silicon Valley for the kinds of startup companies that, in a sense, are feeding off of all of these new technologies. And the addition of the Cornell sort of technology center, which is in the throes of being constructed in conjunction with a major Israeli university, high tech university is going to also provide this market with a lot of the human talent that they need over time. So I think there is a lot of energy still in the city. It is still a city that has a terrific attraction for a lot of talented people and that is still the key ingredient, it seems to me, in the success of a lot of companies where their real, shall we say, future is based on brainpower, and New York is a great city to attract that kind of brainpower. And not just older folks, but a lot of young people. It is outstanding how well New York has done. It's the safest big city in America, it's just doing remarkably well across the whole range of activities I can't predict the valuation of New York real estate, but a part of the valuation of all real estate particularly in the good markets is a reflection as much as anything else about the drop in interest rates. And that has really changed the multiple that people are attributing to real estate income. And I think that's going to continue for quite a while. So I don't see that there's going to be much in the way of a decline of those values. in fact, we are constantly approached by people who want to participate in various buildings in one form or another at very, very attractive rates.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one quick question on Transbay. Did you say what the expected yield is on that asset? And is that based on current market rents or what your forecasted rents are in San Francisco?","Douglas T. Linde","We didn't and we're not going to. I mean, it's a project that's going to be built, starting sometime in early '14 at the earliest. It's delivering in 2017. We are -- if there's an improved approved design, it's an amazing design that will hopefully be improved upon dramatically by, well, the combined organizations of Heinz and Boston Properties. And the good news is that it's just too early to be throwing out numbers as to where we think rents are going to be at that point in time and what our project costs are going to be. So we think the cost is going to be somewhere around $700 a square foot, probably. Do we know what the profile of the tenants on the buildings are going to be? No. Do we know how much pre-leasing were going to have? If any, no. So we're just not ready to throw out numbers.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But your intent is to go fully spec on that asset?","Douglas T. Linde","No, I didn't say that. The nice thing is that we don't have to even think about making that decision for the better part of the year.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Look, we are very enthused about that building. Just so that there is no ambiguity about it. It is in an outstanding location, as I've said before. The only full block site in the downtown, part of San Francisco are experienced in our other real estate there. And San Francisco is about as strong as any market that we are in. And we are very comfortable and confident about the strength of that market. And this is going to be the iconic building in the city. And so we think there's a very good chance that we will do very well with it. We cannot really predict the exact rent, but I can only tell you though on the basis of our preliminary numbers, we're very excited about the prospect of being involved in this building, we're involved with an outstanding partner who shares our view. So I think we are very much looking forward to it. San Francisco has been just a fabulous market for office space for the last number of years, and we've seen it and experience it with Embarcadero Center, and we just couldn't be happier with the way that's going. So we're really very comfortable about taking on this particular project.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Doug, at the end of your commentary, you talked a little bit about dispositions and I think you said as you think about rejiggering the portfolio as well as capital. And I was wondering if you can sort of elaborate a little bit, did you intend to say that against the cap structure of the company, do you think about differently about how you look at your equity base or your debt base or your cash base or is it simply just recycling of capital in that commentary?","Douglas T. Linde","It was more of a comment on the recycling of our portfolio. So there are buildings and there are locations that probably are less opportunistic for us from a growth perspective on a going-forward basis that don't necessarily meet the same characteristics of attractiveness to tenants in 2014 or 2015 that they did in earlier generations of development and maybe the right time to move out of some of those assets.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just thinking about the cash into next year. Because obviously you would have it -- as you invest that capital and have a dramatic effect on underlying earnings, and probably the biggest differential between where the Street is today and where your initial guidance is, is the use of that $1.2 billion of cash. And so Mike, I don't know if you could just go over -- obviously, you're generating free cash flow next year. So the cash balance naturally goes up as you retain that cash. And then you have a certain amount of development funding and commitments, next year, which obviously impacts interest expense. I do think you said you're just going to refi the existing debt so that's just in interest savings, but no change in use of that cash. Can you just sort of walk through, under the current plan, where does that cash balance stand at the end of the year? Because then that sort of helps guide what that earnings impact is, as that cash is used.","Michael E. LaBelle","We'll, we've got about $1.2 billion now and we've got $400 million of development spend over the next 15 months, and then another $150 million of development spend, basically in 2014, to complete 250 West 55th Street and 680 Folsom Street. Our cash flow is going up. We do anticipate that we're going to have positive cash flow. So, as you said, that will help. We expect, based upon refinancing the roughly $600 million, we will have cash balances in the $800 million range at the end of next year. And depending on what our opportunity set looks like, what our investment opportunities may be will drive what we do in the capital markets, in terms of raising additional capital through additional debt. As Doug said, disposing of some assets, that might create some capital or we still have the ability to utilize our ATM which has capital available on it in the context of doing additional investment to keep our leverage balanced.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Last question, just on Transbay. Is the joint venture complete 50-50, everyone's at equal portions? That's number one, related to Transbay. Number two is the timing, at least the way Hines was describing it a couple of months ago, seemed to more accelerate it, that they actually want to start this thing mid-summer of '13, with an earlier delivery. So I'm just not sure what sort of change in that thinking or whether you sort of set it out an outside date. And then just in terms of the yield, I guess you use current, let's say a blended mid-60s gross rent on, let's call it a $1 billion building. You're talking a low 5 yield, with some loss factor. And I'm just wondering if that's how we should think, at least about it on a current basis, using current rents.","Michael E. LaBelle","I'm going to -- let me try and answer a couple of portions of that question. So, on the timing, our view on where the drawings currently are and what it will take to complete the building drawings to the point where we would have a set of drawings that we could bid and then get going on a construction, is really about a year. Could it be accelerated by a couple of months? Potentially. But that's sort of the perspective, and the land purchase will occur sometime during the first quarter, probably of 2013. So that's sort of where our timing expectations come from. I mean, believe me, if there's tenant demand and there's a way to accelerate it, we will do everything in our power to put ourselves in a position to meet that tenant demand. With regards to building, the product that we are going to be creating is going to be a pretty unique product, in terms of how it fits within the context of the existing market. And the height of the building, the height of the floors, the mechanical systems, the window systems, the way HVAC is being distributed. It's going to be a pretty unique product. And we clearly believe that the product is not going to be leased at the market in contrast with buildings that were built between 1970 and 1995 or 2000, in San Francisco. So, we clearly believe that it will achieve the rent that is higher than where the actual market is today, on sort of a relative basis.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is the complete 50-50 straight-up JV all equal on everything?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Conversations of retailers for the CBS space to GM. What's your sense of where retail rents are going to wind up being relative to what CBS was paying? And how material does TI spend? Are we looking at, there, to make that suitable for retailers?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","We certainly are looking at it, to make it suitable for retailers and we're in discussion with any number of them. I'm not saying that we're close to a transaction. But, yes, that is going to be the principal focus of it. That's the kind of the companies that we are talking to.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","But the sort of rents there versus what CBS was paying, would be sort of ballparkish? I mean, are we looking flattish? Are we looking slightly up, slightly down?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I'll just say, go ahead.","Michael E. LaBelle","A big portion of the space is street-level space, which is going to be incredibly attractive opportunistic space. There's also some lower level and third level space. So when you kind of look at it altogether, it's going to be equal to, to down a little bit, from what CBS was paying based upon our current expectations.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, given the commentary on the weakness, the $100-plus price point in New York City, you think that's just a temporary phenomena given the market conditions or are you starting to see more of those tenants when you look at your '14, '15, '16 rolls in your portfolios that might look to move down into high-quality $80, $90 space and save some on the rent. Are we still talking about 10,000-square foot tenants where it's not really material to their overall numbers?","Michael E. LaBelle","I would say it's the latter. And it's not that it's weak, it's just slow. And it's clearly a different type of environment than it was back in 2007, which was sort of my point in providing the contrast numbers. It doesn't mean that it's not going ever get there again, it's just that the market that we're in right now is a different type of a market, and it's a market where you have to be prepared to do smaller transactions to lease a space. The good news is that the floor plan at 510 Madison Avenue, which is the building that, obviously, where we're trying to get $100-plus rents, is 11,500 square feet or less. So it is sort of been created and it's been positioned to maximize the opportunity set for those types of tenants.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caton from Morgan Stanley.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","More information on San Francisco, you talked about the higher-end market is a little bit weaker. And I wonder, what kind of needs to happen in the market, in your view, for a pickup to occur? Because presumably, some of that market will need to lease the Transbay Tower.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well look at by this, I have to tell you, that is a very, very strong market. San Francisco remains a very, very strong office market. And we've seen it in all the things that we've done there and we've got a big exposure there, given us the chance to test that market. So we're very comfortable with that market. I can't tell you where it's going to be in a year because that market, while it is primarily dependent upon the world of new technologies, who knows where that's going to go. But from all indications, it's just going in a very positive way. So frankly, I'm very bullish about that market compared to almost any other market. And we've had that experience in terms of, both the quantity of space and the rents that we've been getting, quantity of space leased and the rents we've been getting, both at 680 Folsom Street. But also, in particular, at our major office complex that we already have, which is 3.4 million feet of space. It's Embarcadero Center, which is done very, very well and at growing rents and growing occupancy rates. We have real comforts with that market, to lease as good as any other market we know.","Robert E. Pester","This is Bob Pester. I just might just add that the floors Doug mentioned, that we have an EC 4 that are vacant right now, which are high-end floors. It's not that they are without activity, we actually have several proposals pending on those floors. Whether we make those deals remains to be seen, but we do have activity on those floors.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you spend a minute just talking about uses of cash and opportunities for external growth? You've bought into a development, 2 development sites here in San Francisco. I wonder, are you looking at similar opportunities in other markets? Or what is the tenor of the acquisition pipeline as it stands now?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, look, generally speaking, because of our experience with, and our comfort with, and frankly, our ability to deliver, in a sense the highest yields we get out of development projects in which we are playing a major role and that's what we're seeing in San Francisco. But it is also true that there are opportunities that will come by and we are in a position to take advantage of them. And we saw, with buildings like the John Hancock building or indeed Prudential Center or indeed the General Motors Building, all of which were acquisitions. So we're, in a sense -- we balance out our development pipeline with our acquisitions, they are different. We have, in our judgment, and will continue to have, access to the capital markets if we need more capital for major acquisitions. Providing of course we continue to do well and invest well, and we think we will. So these are the 2 ways in which we have grown our asset portfolio. We're going to be very cautious about building new buildings, unless we're very comfortable with where the market is. And the reason for that is obvious, we do not know and nobody does know, in our judgment, just where this economy is going. As many of you know, I'd be quite bearish about this economy. And happily so, given what we're able to do about it for the last 6 or 7 years. And I don't see that this economy is a very strong economy at this point. Now, just to give you an example, we don't know what the fiscal cliff consequences will be, if we ever hit the fiscal cliff. But, obviously, that would have a major effect of the economy. We don't know what it will be if we have a new administration. If you do have a new administration that does inspire the confidence of the business community in ways that the current administration doesn't, I think that will have a positive effect on the economy, particularly on the business economy. So, I think we just -- as we had done ever since the company was started, we basically just try and adapt to the conditions that we are in or where we see they are going. There are couple of big question marks out there at the moment, such as the election and the fiscal cliff that I think will make us a little bit more cautious over the short run. Unless we can find an investment where we think the rents are reasonable in relation to the market and where we have a long-term credit lease on it, so that we will be able to do well given the gap between the yield at which we can buy the property and the financing that we have to -- financing cost that we have to incur if we, basically, expand our financing in the capital markets. And we have that option, and frankly, we don't think we are doing it just for the sake of investing to earn a 2% or 3% differential above our financing cuff. But we're also looking at the real estate because we really do have a conscious awareness of the quality of real estate and its long-term viability. So it's just an entrepreneurial time and an entrepreneurial business in general, and we have been able, I think, to be nimble enough to do well in good markets and in bad markets. And we'll just have to pay attention to what's going on and see if we can come up with opportunities. We've been able to do it in both good markets and bad markets, and we have to say that, although we can't give anybody any assurances, that we think will be able to continue to do that.","Douglas T. Linde","Yes, Chris. I think Mort made some really great points. Because, in Calgary 2012, we're going to have committed $1.4 billion of acquisitions. I try to describe sort of a profile of development in other things that are coming through in 2014 and 2015, and 2016 and 2017. And you would not be surprised to hear us say that there are lots of buildings that are for sale. There are lots of buildings that we have spent time analyzing and debating internally, and there are lots of buildings that haven't chose to make a serious bid on. And they're in San Francisco, they're in Boston, they're in Washington, D.C., they're in New York City. And so, the opportunities are out there, in terms of just simply buying buildings if you just want to buy buildings. But I think Mort makes a great point which is, we're not interested in growing the company for the sake of growing the company. And we've been -- I guess we have the luxury of being picky about the types of assets that we want to buy and the particular characteristics of those assets in their various submarkets. And whether we feel good or bad about what the opportunities that might be, from those buildings to improve their cash flow or whatever our whole period is, which is typically incident. So I think that we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to be cautious, and we're going to be very aggressive at looking at things. I don't know how aggressive we'll be at doing things. But I'd say, I feel no different today than I did at the beginning of 2012, in terms of what the opportunity that might be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Mort, if you take your comments on the business community, if you look at what's going on the consumer side, it seems like the consumer sentiment is improving. So shouldn't, at some point, we see that spill over in the business feeling better about the environment to sell goods or can the 2 sort coexist on different paths?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, let's just look at the overall economy now. I mean, GDP growth in the second quarter has been lowered to an annualized rate, I think of about 1.3% from 1.7%. Now that is in the context of the most stimulus fiscal and monetary policy in our history, by far. So something is not going right in the economy and nobody quite knows why it is going so bad. Some of it, of course, is the lack of confidence in the business community in the policies of this administration, to be blunt about it. And I just don't know where it's going to go. Frankly, we have a $1.3 trillion deficit this year. I keep on saying we've run up deficits in 4 years that took us 217 years, from the founding of this country, to run a similar amount of money. I don't what the consequences of that kind of debt will be on what we need to do in this country to continue to be effective and competitive. We've got to support education, we've got the support infrastructure. I could give you a laundry list of things. What are we going to be able to do with the kind of debts we're incurring. I don't know the answer to that because it's unprecedented, and therefore, unpredictable. All I'm saying is, frankly, there are real issues that we need to look at and nobody knows how they're going to work out. I mean, I don't know any -- I certainly don't know and I follow this stuff is closed to most people because it's just unprecedented. And everybody's going to say, let's wait and see how it goes over the next year. There is some improvement, there is some build-up, there's a modest increase in expenditures. But the net worth of the average American family has gone down fairly dramatically, almost 40% from 2007 to today. Mostly were because of the drop in value of their homes. But the residential market is coming back, at least a little bit. The energy picture of this country is being transformed by what we're now in a position to develop, the new methods of tapping into natural gas, particularly, but oil as well. So there are some positive things that are going on in this country. How they balance out over time is, frankly, is just unknown. I think we have had a tendency, and I think rightly, of being a little bit cautious under these circumstances. And thank god that we were and at the time we were because, frankly, it has enabled us to, for example, make some great acquisitions. When we sold a lot of buildings. We have the money to make some acquisitions. I think there will be similar opportunities for us in the way of acquisitions. And we will continue to look for development deals that we think make sense in the markets that we are in. We are continuing to find development opportunities that make sense for us. And those are the markets that, by and large, not perfectly, are the best markets in the country and we focus on these markets for the reasons that we have gone over many, many times. They have worked out relatively well, we have, perhaps, weakness in one market. But, by and large, the kinds of brain power that we try -- and the companies that we try to attract are in the markets that we are in, and those are the markets that should be growing. I mean, I'm not saying there's a lot of brainpower in Washington. That's a whole other issue. But setting aside, the government is continuing to grow and they're still the primary input in the economic health of the region, along now with a lot of other high-tech and life-enhancing technologies that are just burgeoning in that part of the world. So you just have play it by ear. That's why I keep on emphasizing that this is an entrepreneurial business, not just a -- more than anything else, we have to be very careful in what we do, but we also have to be in a position where we look for the advantageous acquisition to buy their land or development sites or buildings, and to apply the capital that we are fortunate to be able to raise, and we expect to continue doing that. We've been doing it for quite a long time and I certainly hope we'll to be continuing doing it for quite a long time. And all I can tell you is that there is no predictability of this in the sense that you will have in a number of other businesses other than an extrapolation of the record that we have accomplished over all the years that we have been in business.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So just following up there . As you guys spoke earlier about the growth of tech and life science being driver tenants, especially here in New York. What has that done to do with the way you guys cost developments? Are saying developments have to be re-costed or designed differently to accommodate the willingness of those tenants to pay their rents or those tenants will still pay the same rents that financial services, professional services, will pay to build new buildings?","Douglas T. Linde","Let me just give you a couple of examples. People are paying more in that midtown and south market, today, for space than they are paying on 6th Avenue, for the portions of buildings that are vacant, particularly the lower portions of buildings. So I think that would suggest to you that it's not a question of price, necessarily, it's a question of product and location. And, similarity in San Francisco, you are probably seeing rents that are higher in some of the buildings, not just south of the market, but sort of outside of the traditional office areas on Market Street, because of the particular location and the environment that those buildings are providing and the attractiveness to the tenants that happen to be in those markets today. And similarly, and if you look at some of the tenants that have gone to Cambridge, there, the rents in Cambridge are higher than the rents in places like in the low-rise in the financial district of Boston. So it's not about price, Andrew, it's about product and it's about location.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Quick question. First, for Mike. Can you refresh our memory as to what your 2012 and 2013 FFO would be after deducting out FAS-141? Is that $0.40 a share for '12 and maybe $0.25 per share for '13?","Michael E. LaBelle","The FAS-141 for 2013 is just over $60 million for the company, including both the wholly-owned and the JVs and it was about $5 million higher in 2012.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, not much of an adjustment at all?","Michael E. LaBelle","No.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second, maybe, Doug. I think the most important number you guys threw out was an incredibly strong FAS number for 2013. Where are you on taxable income for '12 and '13, and how are you thinking about the dividend?","Douglas T. Linde","So our taxable income for 2013 is certainly projected to be higher than our income for 2012. You might infer from that, that we need to think about our dividend, which is a good inference. We've begun those conversations at the board and we anticipate concluding those conversations over the relatively short period of time and letting the Street know how our dividend policy will work towards our projection on our 2013 numbers.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay, and Ray Ritchey, if he's there. Big picture number, Ray. Forgetting your own portfolio, I know it's Impossible to do, but 350 million and 450 million square foot market, greater D.C., MFA. Do you see flat, negative or positive absorption in 2013?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, I still think, John, that the uncertainty, the overhang from the election will be in place probably for another 3 or 4 or 5 months, even after the election. And not to take a page from Mr. Zuckerman, but I think it's going to depend very much and who the winner of the election is. But I do think there's tremendous pent-up demand. I think like, virtually every market, there's winners and losers. And, again, I think we position ourselves to be, very much, in the winner side of that equation. But, again, I think is going to be very much dependent on the election.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that's a great segue for Mort. Mort, why don't you give a prediction in terms of who wins and the electoral count?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I have believed, for all of this year, that Romney will win the election. Primarily because of the terrible unemployment numbers that this country is dealing with, a lot of which doesn't even get publicity. But I'll just give you a couple of examples. It's not only the 23 million people out of work. The unemployment numbers do not really give you an indication of how serious the unemployment is. The unemployment number is 7.8%, it's what is called U3, and that measures people who've actively applied for a job. That is, they have to have sort of filled out an application form or gone for an interview. And that is the number, that is 7.8%.  But the number of 7.8% only went down because 582,000 people moved out of being unemployed into part-time employment. But if you measure, what they call involuntary part-time employment, which is U6, that's 14.7%, it hasn't gone down at all. But even that doesn't give you the full number. Disability insurance has gone up by 5.4 million people just in the period that President Obama has gone. It's almost doubled the number. Okay. Now, if you think that the 5.4 million people who were suddenly disabled as a result of their work, I think that's a very optimistic interpretation. I think a lot of people have gone into that as they've run out of unemployment compensation or what-have-you and they've been able to do it, but they don't count as unemployed. Nor do people who were put on leave, even if it's temporary leave, and a lot of people have been. So the unemployment numbers, to my mind, it's known by the people who are unemployed. It's known by their families, it's known by their friends, and by their children. And some -- at some point or another, there is going to be a feeling -- there's got to be a change. Like it or not, that's where I think is the driving force of this economy. And the one thing that have to happen, which I believe has happened, is that Governor Romney has established himself as a credible President. He was extremely presidential in the first debate, broke through to the consciousness of most Americans. And I believe, as this goes on over the next couple of weeks, the trend lines which are basically now favoring him, will moderately continue, and that he will eke out a  victory. And I felt this way even when these numbers weren't as favorable to Romney as I think they are.","Operator","Your next question --","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","But if you want to make a bet on it, I'm willing up to $10, I'm willing to make a bet on it.","Unknown Analyst","I'll take your side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, I guess you were talking about space usage and how people are using space differently today. I'm wondering if you or Ray or Bob could just talk about when you guys are laying out new leases, and people are doing space planning, what is kind of the new -- what's the new norm? And I assume 250 is kind of thrown out the window. But how do you guys see people using space? And how much further do you think that can go down?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll start then I'll let others jump in. It obviously depends upon the industry group and the kind of work that's done. But as an example, law firms have probably gone from somewhere between 750 and 800 square feet to somewhere below 600 square feet on a per partner basis, and probably close to the 500 square feet per person on an employee basis. There are technology companies that have gone to table format types of environments, where they're well under 200 square feet per person, probably closer to 130 to 140 square feet per person. The one thing that has changed, however, is that the ability to have areas where they can congregate, their staff has become more important. Because there are lots of what we refer to as \"we\" spaces and community spaces that are being constructed in these types of configurations. And so the layout and the building function is pretty important. And then the most crucial thing, when you think about the amount of people you're putting in these spaces is light and air. So to the extent that you have an overly deep floor with a relatively poor window line, you're battling against a very difficult wave. Because you're just not providing the environment that these companies want to use to retain and recruit employees.","Unknown Executive","Just to follow up on that. Relative to that deep floor point. This is really motivating a lot of the law firms in Washington, D.C. from a wholesale move out of an older building into the newer buildings that are specifically designed for this new space dynamic. And also, Steve, on the public sector side, here in Washington, we're seeing the GSA, regardless of who gets elected, really forcing the square footage ratios down to below 200 square feet per person. And I think that's motivating some of their early renewals. I think that was one of the factors with us, renewing DOJ at 1301 New York prior to the 2014 expiration. They wanted to lock in the space and stay where they are as opposed to be subject to these new space dynamics.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess that kind of leads in the question to. Doug, you sort of talked about maybe dispositions and some of the portfolio maybe being on the block. I mean how do these new dynamics -- kind of, how do you think about that in terms of the portfolio? What you want to own going forward? What may become more structurally obsolete? And when you look at the occupancy rates, there's obviously a big divergence between the CBD occupancy and the suburban. So is it fair to say that there are bigger challenges and opportunities for disposition in the suburban or is that not the case?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that's a very fair characterization. Although there are some CBD assets that we are looking at and saying, \"Is the cash flow of this asset such that we think we can maximize the value today or do we think that when the lease roll's over, there is going to be an opportunity for significant improvement and therefore we should sort of hang on to this asset?\" And there are -- I mean there are cases like that. I mean, no difference in the decision we made with our building with Ernst & Young in Times Square, back in 2004 -- or '06 when we sold that. There are some core assets like that, that we would look at in a disposition format as well. But I think the focus is on some of the suburban markets.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just a question that sort of relates to Transbay. That project and then there's a number of other developments that are also either about to start or can be built in that SOMO market. So there's probably upwards of maybe 2 million feet that can be built in that market over the next couple of years. I mean, do you anticipate there being additional migration of tenants into that downtown market? Or is this really more of a game of musical chairs?","Douglas T. Linde","I think more than any other city in the country, Steve, I think it's not musical chairs, it's growth. The -- in the last 2 years, the proportion of transactions that have occurred involving technology companies, and these are -- many of these are technology companies that didn't exist 5 years ago, is the majority of the leasing transactions in San Francisco. And our view right now is that there are lots of transactions that are going to occur based upon employment and the fact that there are lots of technology companies that would like to have employees who live in the city working for them, and the commuting patterns associated with moving out to the Silicon Valley are challenging. And there are more and more that would -- are prepared to -- who sort of say, \"Well, if we want the best and the brightest, we also need to consider having a location in the city to attract that type of a workforce.\" And so I think that there will be -- if there is a city with a chance for there to be significant job growth and demand generation from corporate companies, I think San Francisco is the market that has the best chance for that.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Just to give you an illustration of that, let me just take a second, okay? There is a company called Salesforce, which in the last number of months has taken 800,000 square feet of space. It's a brand-new company that didn't exist 3 or 4 years ago -- 4 or 5 years ago. Now this is only happening in San Francisco, and this is what makes that market so unique. And there's a spinoff out of all of these companies that affects all of the other typical companies that -- or firms that work in downtown market. And there is no market like that in the United States. And for that reason, it makes it a very attractive market. As I say, we have been the beneficiary of it in various ways, but we've seen it in Embarcadero Center and 680 Folsom. I mean these are just the kind of energy -- tenant energy that exists there. It just doesn't exist anywhere else. And that's what makes the San Francisco market so unique and, frankly, so attractive.","Robert E. Pester","Steve, this is Bob. Ken Rosen just did an in-depth analytical study of the Bay Area markets from a commercial real estate perspective and job growth perspective. If you take a look at that, that's probably the most compelling argument I've seen on why San Francisco will continue to grow, and I'd be happy to send you a copy.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question, I guess, for Michael LaBelle. And you gave us a lot of detail. Would you be able to just kind of bracket for us what you think cash NOI in kind of just gross dollars would be in 2013?","Michael E. LaBelle","One second.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I can wait for you to give the answer.","Michael E. LaBelle","We have to add up a lot of numbers here, you know. It's not easy.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Some I'm kind of curious regarding the cash balance. Still a very significant number. Mike, in your commentary, you sort of alluded to where the capital markets are these days, in terms of your ability to borrow, probably in significant size. You're able to obviously source investments, but you have a lot of availability in the revolver. You'll live through very -- a very difficult period with limited cash going into it, and here you are in the other side of it. I'm just kind of curious on the thoughts to sort of maintain $800 million average cash balances going forward.","Douglas T. Linde","Let me try and answer that question. I will probably won't do as good a job as Mike would do. But I guess the view is, in a market where we believe that there are going to be plentiful opportunities, in certain cases, being able to move quickly is not a insignificant strategic advantage. And some of these deals could be in excess of $1 billion. Yes, you can line up financing, yes you can go to the capital markets. What we have seen over the past 2 or 3 years is that, even in a very strong market, from a rate perspective, there are weeks and months where the concerns about the risks in these sovereign debt crisis in Europe or the banking crisis in Europe or the inability of the United States government to lift the debt ceiling, close those markets down for a period of time, but the opportunities don't necessarily go away. And so, having the availability of that capital is not necessarily a bad thing. But we recognize that it's a luxury that we are asking our shareholders to allow us to have via effectively holding $800 million of cash and not sort of using our line and being incredibly efficient. But it's because we really do believe there is an opportunity out there, and we do believe that there are risks associated with not having capital available should there be significant dislocations in the capital markets at any point in time when we might need money to do something, including paying off a debt.","Michael E. LaBelle","Just going back to the question that we had to go look at the numbers for. So the cash NOI, which would include the NOI from the same-store portfolio, the acquisition, the developments coming online and the joint ventures is about $1.3 billion.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. I'll make sure to call Steve up and let him know. So separately, in terms of the opportunity, just sort of back to that, in response to the last question, do you see greater opportunity ahead, just sort of CMBS maturities? I mean, like to a greater extent opportunity -- I mean, well -- could you see greater opportunity than you saw in 2012 -- or you've seen in 2012? The $1.4 billion or so?","Michael E. LaBelle","As I said before, I think -- I feel like as we enter 2013, it's a very similar type of environment that it was in 2012. It's interesting. All of the problems that Mort has been talking about are all of the same problems he was referring to a year ago. And we've just sort of moved through another calendar without much in the way of a resolution on any of it, unfortunately. So I think the opportunity set is sort of there other than maybe the lifecycle of some of the people who've made investments in previous times has gotten further along. And if they're IRR driven, maybe they are -- there's receptivity to selling. And there's a concern that the low interest rate environment may be less of a prolonged period than it was a year ago. But aside from that, I really do think that, that things just sort of feel like they're the same.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's fair. Mort, is it safe to assume if Romney wins you'd advised Doug and Jim to take that cash balances down?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Only if we can find the right kind of investments. Just because he gets elected, doesn't mean he's going to be able to turn around this economy. We're in really an unprecedented kind of economic condition. It's obviously the worst kind of economic condition since the Great Depression, that's why it's called the great recession. And we're just going to have to watch it, and we'll see what opportunities come by. I mean the good news about, frankly, the position that we are in as a company and the access to capital that we have, which we like to sort of accumulate it when the accumulation is going well. We just always seem to find opportunities and as, Doug said, we want to be able to be in a position to move quickly and to move authoritatively, and not to worry about having to put together financing at the time that an opportunity comes up. It really does give us a competitive advantage, and people who want to get -- to dispose of assets and know that, and we're prepared to make those commitment in very, very strong terms when we make our proposals. So for my point of view, this is an opportunity for us because we have a comparative advantage over a number of different investors. It doesn't mean we have a unique advantage but it certainly is a comparative advantage, and we're going to try and take advantage of it. And when you can get into a situation where you can find outstanding buildings with a relative good leasing profile. Obviously, on some level, there's lower risk in that than starting a new building because of the condition of the markets, in general. Until we see a better economy, we'll sort of look at it a little bit with some skepticism over anticipating any assumptions that anticipate a big regrowth in the demand for office space. So I think we -- from our point of view, it is one of the great advantages that we have had, that we have taken advantage of, which is to be able to commit, in a sense, commit capital and then reraise or raise more capital because of the quality of the buildings we've bought and how well we've done with them. And that is just something we're not going to walk away from. I can't tell you how it's going to work because as I've said over and over again it's an entrepreneurial business, and we've got to be able to do to what we have been able to do in the past, we have to be able to do that in the future, you just never know how that's going to work out. We just think that over a year, or around a year, we found out that we take advantage of various opportunities that come our way, even on a competitive basis. And we're going to keep ourselves in a position to do that. And we have a very long-term view about the real estate that we invest in because we really hope that whatever the conditions are today, when you look at the building 5 years out and 10 years out, you want to be able to feel comfortable that the rents that are currently in place have a reasonable chance of being significantly improved. Some of the leases that we buy into have automatic step-ups after 5 years and after 10 years. And given the GAAP, as I said, between our financing costs and the yields in which we can buy buildings, when you compound that with the kind of increases that are mandated, within existing leases it's a fairly good combination in conjunction with the development work we're doing. So that's -- we've been doing this for years. And the unique conditions that we're in now just require a sort of a different kind of concentration on different aspects of it. But I still think and do feel that there's going to be a number of opportunities to come up. It's not going to come up -- there's not going to be 2 every month or one every quarter or whatever it is. They come up when they come up, and we want to be able to move as soon as those opportunities are available.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I believe on the last call, Mort, in your commentary you had mentioned 2 potential acquisitions that you might tie up in the next short while. I assume one of those was at the Folsom Street. I was wondering if you could comment on the second.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","We haven't acquired it yet. So I'd just leave it hanging at the moment. But the Folsom Street was one, and we are very happy with that transaction. That's going to work out extremely well for us.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Second -- I mean has the second one fallen out or it's actually something you're still working on?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","No. No. No. We're still working on it.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to San Francisco, I mean -- I know we're seeing a lot of leases get signed there, but could you talk a little bit about just the number of employees actually in those spaces? I mean are tenants signing leases expecting to find employees to grow? Or are they kind of foreseeing the scenes that need new space? And the reason I asked, just talking to brokers out there, it sounds like there's some concern about people just being able to find talent to grow.","Robert E. Pester","I'll answer that, this is Bob. I think it depends on the tenant. I mean, certainly there are some tenants that are taking more space than they need. But I think that would be the exception rather than the rule. Macy's.com, which is occupying space in 680 Folsom and it has approximately 220,000 square feet, we met with them the other day and they actually are looking at taking additional spaces at this time. In fact, they just leased some space over on Fourth  Street to tide them over until they move into this building. So I think you're seeing a combination of 2 types of tenants, some that, for the most part, take the space they need with little growth, and then other tenants that are taking space with the anticipation of that they're going to grow.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the commentary on space for employees, do you guys get the sense that maybe the pendulum swing a little too far? And we've kind of hit the bottom and maybe things will start moving the other way? Or do you think this is here to stay?","Michael E. LaBelle","So we've been in a -- how shall we say it? Employee or er-friendly labor market for an extensive period of time. When you get into an employee market where there's an opportunity for employees to move, I think that the environment that those employees have been asked to live in is going to become an important determinant as to whether or not they are just sticking around or moving to the next opportunity. That along with compensation obviously. And so, I think there's certainly a risk that companies that are looking simply at their employees as a cost, and they're looking to try and squeeze them into the smallest amount of space possible so they can reduce their costs, are going to be at risk for being in difficult situation. But there's also are different ways, people are working. And as people think about how they're working differently and they're using space differently, it may be that it becomes much more comfortable and traditional 5 years to have employees that are working at, effectively, trading operations types of debt spaces with big community areas and lots of conference rooms and telephone rooms so that they can get their privacy when it's necessary. And that made me feel very comfortable. So I think it's going to really be dependent upon the particular industry group and how those individual companies really treat their employees from both a -- community space as well as an individual space.","Robert E. Selsam","It's Robert Selsam. I want to add one flow to that. It depends entirely on the industry that you're looking at. For example law firms have shrunk their usage space per partner dramatically. But you'll get to a point where they still want private-windowed offices. So the shrinkage there cannot go much further unless they dramatically change the way law firms work. And thus far, I have not seen that, and they're a good part of our portfolio.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. A final question for Ray. The fact that you got the GSA to sign a lease, it sounds like maybe we'll see more kind of defense-related, just what's the pipeline of demand there and why you think leases are getting signed now?","Unknown Executive","Well, as I said previously, I think some are kind of opportunistic type of execution of leases. I think the renewal of 1301 clearly falls in that case. I think our discussions with the last piece of space at Patriots Park is also opportunistic. I think the private sector is really the one we need to focus on, and whether the defense cuts that are planned  are actually implemented, that could be that has a profound impact. I think the other thing is GSA is still trying to sort its way out from the issues they have relative to the internal controls both on the execution of leases but also their G&A. And we're seeing many GSA contract officers just waiting on the sidelines to make sure the actions are about to take will not be scrutinized either by other GSA officials or congress. So there was a temporary paralysis hopefully after the first of the year will break loose both on the public and the private side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","A quick question for -- obviously 2013, cash -- seems NOI is very good. That's a story of free rent burn off. That -- wouldn't it be logical to conclude that the story of 2014 if we speculate ahead that far would also look pretty healthy from, sort of, a mix of still some free rent burn off, improving occupancy and probably by that time, hopefully better re-leasing spreads.","Michael E. LaBelle","Certainly possible, Michael. I mean we've got, as I've said, our occupancy we're talking about going from 91.6 today to an average of between 92 and 93 in 2013. So there is certainly still room to grow that occupancy. And you've got space in New York City in places like 510 Madison Avenue, 540 Madison Avenue, as you leased up the space, which as Doug pointed out he kind of went through some of the spaces that we kind of didn't say we're going to lease until the end of '13. Those are high-quality spaces, very marketable spaces they will lease. So as they lease, they will improve our cash flow in those periods.","Unknown Executive","Michael, I'd -- just to protect Mike and the rest of us , we're not nearly ready to talk about 2014.","Michael E. LaBelle","The only other thing that I would mention that we've mentioned in the past, Michael, is that the Hancock Tower. We still have the Bain Capital lease on free rent through 2013. And into the beginning of 2014, that's a 270,000-square foot lease.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","On San Francisco, not that they would be mutually exclusive, but how did you think about on with [indiscernible] as opposed to buying 101 California, which was recently on the market?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well let me just say that we, number one, expect the yields on the development that we are anticipating to frankly be better and higher than the 101 California. But frankly, we would have bought 101 California if we could have gotten it at price we prepared to pay. It's just a very good building.","Unknown Executive","Michael, I'd just might add, that 101 treated at a low sub for CAP rate. Actually, it was in the 3s. And it's a 35, 40-year-old building at this point, and we feel on Transbay that we can sell the building for a similar cost with higher yield.","Michael E. LaBelle","So -- and, Michael, just to give you a perspective. So when we looked at 101, we looked at 333 market which is Wells Fargo building. And If you -- in order to sort of get to the same -- or the kind of IRR that you need to sort of rationalize those investments, the rents that you're looking for in those buildings are actually higher on a projected basis than they're what we were looking at for the rents that we would be leasing at, at the Transbay tower in 2015 and 2017.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. And then just my last question. It sounds like you answered this earlier, but your official position on new supply in San Francisco CBD is that you're not worried about the impact on that market.","Douglas T. Linde","I think we're always worried about new supply. But if -- but our view is that if there is a market that's going to be able to handle new supply over the next 5 years, san Francisco is that market. Largely because there are very few large financial institutions in that city that are going through a downsizing. So I think while those law firms may move through their natural lease expirations, they may get a little bit smaller. And now we're hearing about law firms putting -- pushing their back office operations to places like Nashville, Tennessee. That could occur. But there aren't a lot of large firms that are 500,000 square feet or more that are in that type of a market in San Francisco. And that the month of growth from the technology companies that is taking place in the CBD, South of Market, Mission Bay, North of Market, however, you want to characterize it, is very significant. And it's becoming a very dominant user of space in the city on an incremental basis. And so having the opportunity to satisfy that demand set, relative to any other city in the country on a relative basis, seems like the right place to be thinking about a new development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of positive comments you made about the life sciences space in general. Just wondering what your appetite would be to increase exposure to that particular area? What that might involve and which particular life sciences market would you be attracted to?","Douglas T. Linde","So, Tayo, the only life science market that we have any experience in is the life science market around Cambridge, Massachusetts. And so, it's clearly the place. Look -- they're -- if the Silicon Valley has sort of become the dominant cluster for that -- new technology companies, the Cambridge and the suburban Boston market has become the dominant cluster for life sciences and biotech. I mean, you just hear about company after company that's sort of moving their R&D and moving their thought -- their big thinkers into the Cambridge, Marketplace. So that's the pleased where -- we were considering. And by the way, when Sports City was looking at the sale of their 50% interest in their MIT portfolio that was purchased by one of the other REITs last year, we look at that. So we have an interest in looking at those types of properties at the right -- at relatively the right pricing level and the right location, it's something we would be interested in.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You wouldn't consider South San Francisco?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that South San Francisco marketplace is largely dominated by one major tenant that really -- that would prefer to own as opposed to lease space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","On your 2013 guidance, is it fair to assume that you are assuming that there is no -- we don't go over the fiscal cliff and there is no impact?","Douglas T. Linde","I would -- I don't think that, that's a fair characterization. I would assume that, I think that we are assuming that whether we may or may not go over the fiscal cliff, we have been pretty, I think, reasonable at our lease up projections are on available space in the portfolio. If we go over the fiscal cliff, there's going to be a resolution after that point. It's not going to be a prolonged let's cut our noses off to spite our face. I mean, I think, unfortunately, there is the precedent who believes that this unit -- this country has to get to the precipice of a crisis before it can have the political desire on the part of the legislature to get something worked out. And so, it could happen and then at some point it will get reversed. I don't think it's a -- we're going to -- go to the fiscal cliff, and then for the next 3 years, we're going to be looking at that higher taxes and lower spending.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I won't quote Winston Churchill, but we know him and somebody you might be referring to, I think. But could I paraphrase your answer then, Doug, if I may. So what you're saying is if we do go over the fiscal cliff, is there would be no impact on your 2013 guidance?","Douglas T. Linde","No, I didn't say there would be no impact, but I think we were reasonably conservative about what we think the overall economic impacts are going to be whether there is or isn't a positive solution in the short-term.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the numbers could be low if we get early resolution in lame duck if we take a very optimistic scenario?","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think so. Because from a macro perspective, it's not going to -- things are just not going to get better quickly. I think that the psychology will get better. If the psychology gets better, people will want to start to make decisions. But as we know in the real estate world, it takes time from a decision to a lease. And so 2013 is just a year where there's not going to be a lot of strong opportunities for those things to happen.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","We draw a distinction between an optimist and a pessimist today in the following way: an optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds, and a pessimist fears he may be right.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well that matches Mr. Churchill's quote so I think [indiscernible] Can they -- just a couple of points of detail, and this is probably for Mike. G&A capitalization is going to increase at the same rate as your interest capitalization?","Michael R. Walsh","It's Michael Walsh, David. It should be flat to what it's been. A slight increase because of adding 680 Folsom, but nothing material.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then there was no ATM issuance in third quarter?","Michael E. LaBelle","No. There has been none.","Unknown Analyst","So the capacity on the programs is the same as you reported in the second quarter.","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes. We had about $300 million left on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","One quick question. Mike LaBelle, your 2013 guide, does it assume any lease up of Bay Colony from where Bay Colony stands at the end of Q3?","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes. I mean, as Doug mentioned, we have some good activity from some, probably, sizable tenants. Tenants are -- that are between 40,000 and 60,000 square feet that are looking at Bay Colony, that have been excited about our plan there. We completed one of the buildings and re-did all the common areas, we re-skinned another building and it looks great out there. The challenges Doug went through is getting these people from I'm excited about this to actually making a decision to lease space. And none of them have said we're staying where we are, we're changing our mind, so what we have done is we said we aren't going to do some leasing in Bay Colony, it's going to be later in the year in 2013 though. As opposed to sometime in the next 2 quarters.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just a quick related question for Doug. In terms of the -- in terms of your target marketing, if you will, for Bay Colony. I think it was about a year ago that you say that you were looking for tenants who were -- that you were going to focus your search on tenants that were looking for larger spaces as Mike has detailed? Has there been any shift in your opinion in terms of submarket desirability such that the market that you thought might be there is either looking elsewhere in the greater Boston area? Or is it just a slowness in the decision process that we've heard you mention a few times?","Douglas T. Linde","No. I think our focus is correct. Interestingly, the thing that we've seen is that there's been an in-migration of the venture capital community. Out of places like Bay Colony into places like Cambridge and into Boston, but the technology companies that are being formed through the VC funds unless they are life sciences, they're not -- they're -- then they are in Cambridge unit at the start. And as soon as they get to a scale, they realize that they can no longer afford to be in Cambridge. So they move out of Cambridge. And some are moving to the Seaport District, and some are moving out to the suburbs. But we've actually seen more growth from a tenant perspective and more successes in Waltham, Lexington market from a demand perspective than we've seen anywhere else other than Cambridge.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question on Hancock. Can you update us on where you stand on releasing and rolling up some of sub-tenants? I think when you bought the building, you said there was about 800,000 square feet that you thought would go to the $60s from $35 to $40 in 2014 and beyond. But how much of that have you already locked in through forward leasing and have you been able to get to a sort of rent increases?","Douglas T. Linde","So we have a relet approximately 200,000 square feet of space that had 2015 lease expirations. There's probably another 75,000 to 100,000 square feet that we are currently working on, which I described. The rest of it is in the base of the building and that's where State Street is currently located and that -- those leases don't expire until the end of 2014. And those tenants are not going to be staying at the base of the building in all likelihood, so our assumption is that those are going to be new tenants. As opposed to what we've done previously, which is we have existing tenants who have no interest in leaving who have come to us and said we want to do an early renewal because we want to lock in for 10 years after 2015. And in every single case, we've seen the rollups that we anticipated. They haven't -- a lot of them haven't come through our numbers yet because the existing sub-tenant leases are still in place, right? So -- but in every cases, we are seeing the rents that we anticipated but not more.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And there was a similar rollup opportunity for the State Street space?","Douglas T. Linde","There is a similar rollup opportunity for the State Street space. It's -- I think the rents will not be as high, I mean if we're getting mid-60s-plus from up the 22nd floor to the 50th floor, the rents that we've projected at the base of the building were more in the nature of $45 to $50 a square foot, and that's where we're making proposals today. But there's still a lot of significant rollup from where State Street is currently leasing space from us.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And one more question, I know this is from Westfield but on the GM Building, are your currently being paid for the signage? Or is that still a future opportunity for you?","Douglas T. Linde","We're -- there's -- nobody has any signage rights on the building right now.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Douglas T. Linde","I think we've overextended our welcome with you as investors. So have a good lunch. And we will see some of you in the REIT in San Diego and some of you we'll see I'm sure in the halls of the various conferences that occur in the beginning of the year in New York City. So thanks and have a nice day.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call.

In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.

Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. We are I think very pleased to be able to report to you on this last quarter because I think it still demonstrates what we have reiterated on the previous calls such as this and in many other interactions with the public shareholders. And that is the quality of our assets and the location of our assets and the markets that we are and the basic strategy that we have followed serves us very well in more difficult economies as well as in very good economies. And I think the performance of our assets is once again I think quite reflective of and indicative of the strategy and the assets and the management that we have pulled together. So I think we are still doing fairly well in, as I said, what is a weak economy, an economy that is growing at about 1.5% a year in the context of the biggest and most stimulative fiscal and monetary policy in our history. And nobody quite knows where this economy is going. There are just a lot of vulnerabilities to it. But we still feel and think and believe that the kinds of assets that we have and the markets that we are in, the locations where these assets are and the management skills that we bring to the markets that we are soliciting and servicing in each one of our offices, would be in San Francisco or Washington or New York or Boston as our principal markets, I think we will continue to do relatively well.","But we are not dealing in very strong general macroeconomic environments, and each of these markets does well for one reason or another. We think we can continue as I said to do relatively well. But it's not going to be an easy gliding path, so we're going to have to work hard and we're going to have to work intelligently. We're going to have to make sure that we continue to do what it takes to make the different deals that we are involved with and to close the leasing programs that we have.  And by and large, I think we have done it and I think we will continue to do it.","Now let me just say this. We also intend to maintain the strategy that we have followed from the founding of the company, and that is, that we will concentrate in -- as we say, and it's a bit of a clich\u00e9 but it's a lot more than that, we are going to concentrate on A buildings and A locations. And these are the buildings that we find have perpetually done relatively better in good times, but much more importantly, it does very well relatively in more difficult times, which is the way I would describe the current macroeconomic environment.","Now we do have a couple of things that I think I would like to touch upon, and one of them is in the last quarter, we had brought in Owen Thomas as the CEO. I was previously the CEO, as you may know, but I have not been the CEO for the better part of I'd say 98% of the time that I've been with the company. Ed Linde, the late Ed Linde, my wonderful partner, had been the CEO. And I think the feeling was that we were a 3-man team when Doug us, Doug and Ed and myself. And we were all, believe me, working pretty hard to bring the company to the level that it is currently. And we felt that it was absolutely essential that we bring in a third person, after Ed unfortunately passed away, to take over that job. I took it on, on a more interim level, but it's a full-time job. And we all have a full-time jobs, and we wanted to make sure with a much larger company that we had enough talent at the top to handle everything that not only that we are doing but that we expect to do as we go forward because we're going to continue to grow the company.","So I am delighted that we were able to persuade Owen to join us as the CEO. I think he has both the skills and the personality to work well will all of these key executives of the company and with the public and tenants that we have to deal with. And I think this is going to be a major value added to the company and enable us to continue growing without putting everybody into a stretched-out sort of, shall we say, working day to the point where we are not as effective as we could and should be. So we're back to the 3-man team that we were for so long before, and we think that this will be the best way to nourish our growth. And I think we are fairly confident that even in this relatively difficult economy, I think we're doing quite well. But as soon as this economy really begins to turn up, I think we will be in a position to even accelerate our growth in the various markets that we are in. So I think that has been a major addition to the company, which we needed. And I think this is something that we will all, over time, appreciate. And I think this is what is going to be the leadership team of the company. And I'm delighted to be able to share that with you. And I think we will all be able to appreciate the benefits of having the 3-man team back again to lead the company, as we not only go through relatively more difficult times but as well when we get into, shall we say, stronger economic times.","The one market that I want to focus on briefly that we are more bullish on relatively, frankly is San Francisco. The general environment in that market is dominated by and led by the online world. And when you have companies there that are 2 or 3 years ago were simply unknown companies taking over 1 million feet of space, which is the case in San Francisco last year with at least one company, it is clear that there is a genuine groundswell of demand from these new companies, who are doing extremely well. And so that is the one area where we are being a little bit more aggressive in terms of both the assembly of sites and the development of a new buildings.","I will tell you one story, if I may. Because we were down in San Francisco for the groundbreaking of a project we called Transbay, which is a major project in San Francisco, on a wonderful site, one of the last major sites in what, broadly speaking, is the financial district. And the Mayor was there, and we had basically put forth something on the order of $190 million for the land on this site to build 1,400,000 square feet. And the mayor said this fund -- this check will be used to continue to pay for improvements to the region and to the area. And he said, \"I want to thank Mort Zuckerberg for this money.\" Everybody in the audience recognized he got the names a little bit mixed up, so that when I got up there to speak after him, I said I just want you to know, Mr. Mayor, that Mark Zuckerberg will be paying for the rest of this development. So that's not entirely true. But we do have and are very happy with the kind of relationship we have developed with the leadership in San Francisco, where we are going to be building on the order of over 1.5 million feet over the next several years.","So this is something that I think will enhance our position in San Francisco, where we already have major developments, like Embarcadero Center and several other buildings, all of which are doing extremely well. So we look forward to the growth of that market and to the leading role that we will be able to play as a participant in that market. We did start a 500,000 square-foot building in Washington, DC. But there, we had a 396,000 square-foot tenant in hand with us when we started that building so that one is a relatively sort of, shall we say, satisfactory lease.","But we are not -- we are being very cautious in terms of how we develop assets in these other markets, where we will be doing -- we will be building new buildings, but we will be very careful as to what our pre-leasing is and what the market is in those particular locations. But we will still concentrate on building the highest level of quality in the real estate because we believe that this is the best platform for not only short-term growth but for long-term growth.","And with that, I will end my comments and be happy to answer any questions after several of my colleagues add to the comments that I've just made.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Mort. This is Owen Thomas. Good morning, everyone. As I think many of you or all of you know, I've started at Boston Properties slightly less than a month ago. I actually started on April 2. And let me just say here at the outset that I have long admired the people and franchise of Boston Properties, and I'm honored and excited to be joining the company in a leadership role. In this role, I look forward to working closely with Mort, Doug and Ray as partners in leading Boston Properties in the years ahead.","On the question of strategy, which Mort touched on, I believe Boston Properties has a well-articulated and very successful strategy of focusing on high quality buildings in attractive locations, and this approach will continue to guide our activities.","My primary initial goal has been to immerse myself in all aspects of the company and to just generally get up to speed. More specifically, I focused on meeting our team, seeing as many of the company's assets as possible, understanding the company's systems and procedures.","Over the past 4 weeks since I started, I've been able to visit all of our major offices except one, which I'm visiting next week. During these trips, I've seen or toured a large number of our assets and I've met a great number of Boston Properties employees. Overall, I've been very impressed with the experience, the tenure and the commitment of our employees as well as the quality of the company's real estate assets and systems.","Clearly, it will take me more than a month to get fully up to speed. So my initial immersion efforts I think, while off to a good start, are still very much work in progress. And let me just say in closing that I look forward to working and interfacing with all of you in the years ahead.","With that, I'm here in Boston with Doug, and I will turn it over to him.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Owen. I too want to add my welcome to Owen. We've been spending lots of time together, in person, at dinner, at lunch with a number of the executives in the various regions. And we're getting to know each other. And more importantly, in my perspective, we're getting to know how each other think. We're sharing lots of information and ideas and perspectives. I think it's fair to say that Owen is a pretty quick study, and we are endeavoring to get him into the flow of everything that is going on around here. And I look forward to working with him over the coming weeks and months and years.","So with that, let me get sort of into the nitty-gritty and the heart of our call and sort of what's going on out there. I thought I'd start this morning sort of where I left off last quarter, which was with the statement that we are in the market selling assets right now and that in 2013 we could be selling assets that approach $1 billion or more.","Since we last spoke, we have signed our first 2 deals. The first is at 125 West 55th Street, which is a building in New York City, and the second is a building in Downtown San Jose, 303 Almaden. And in total, those assets have a sales price of about $510 million. But I want to make it clear that we're not done with our efforts to sell assets.","125 West 55th Street is a 588,000 square foot building. It's 98% leased, and it has no rollover until 2021 and the 2 major tenants roll in '21 and '27. The major leases today are slightly or significantly above market. And the asset is encumbered with a $200 million 6.1% mortgage until 2020. And the loan can be repaid or prepaid for a cost of approximately $60 million. So if you ignore the above market financing, the cash NOI for the next 12 months is about $27.4 million, so that gives you an NOI cap of about 5.8%. The 2013 annual GAAP FFO contribution was projected to be about $12.2 million. It's a JV, remember, so that's why it's slightly less. And we anticipate that the transaction is going to close during the second quarter.","125 West 55th really is a core asset. It's got a cash flow profile with no short or medium-term growth opportunities. We've now taken care of all the available space, extended all of the major leases. And we really felt as a partnership, that given current capital market conditions, it was really an appropriate time to exit the asset. And when we think about other assets that we're going to be looking to sell, I think the profile of 125 West 55th Street is a good indication of the things that we are thinking about.","303 Almaden is really a very different type of a situation. This is a 158,000 square-foot building that is located in Downtown San Jose. The major tenant in the building is an accounting firm with about 110,000 square feet. And they have a February 2006 lease expiration. You may remember that we purchased the development site adjacent to this building in 2000 before we purchased 303 Almaden in 2006. And frankly, the Downtown San Jose market has just not experienced the level of activity that we had hoped for when we started making these investments in this market or this submarket. We just haven't been able to get anything going on, on our new development, and we're really now rethinking our plans for that site.","So as E&Y -- the accounting firm, which is the E&Y, came to us to talk about their future tenancy, we started thinking about our releasing assumptions. And quite frankly, we felt that given our view of the submarket, it probably made sense to consider a sale. So we are selling 303 Almaden for $253 a square foot and a projected 2004 cash NOI of $3.1 million. This building is unencumbered.","Now, I want to make it clear that we're not exiting the Silicon Valley. Far from it, we've actually just increased our exposure to Mountain View with a purchase of our partners' interest in the Mountain View Research and the Mountain View Tech Parks at a valuation of $233.5 million. Quite frankly, we view Palo Alto\/Mountain View submarket as the strongest submarket in the valley with the most opportunities for transaction volume and ultimately rental rate growth. The Mountain View assets are currently 88% leased. They have a projected 2013 NOI yield of about 7.4%. And the rents in all of the buildings are about 10% below market. And they have relatively short-term lease expiration profiles. So generally that's a 3 to 5-year market, so there's pretty good rollover.","We are in the initial stages today of marketing additional assets in Washington, DC and Boston, and we're also considering other assets across our regions. Again, the assets that we're thinking about leasing -- selling have long-duration leases with strong credits and very little short or medium-term opportunities to grow cash flow. They're ideal candidates for long-term secured financing and will be very attractive in the current investment climate.","I also want to provide a little bit of an update on where we are with the sale of the 40% interest in 755 (sic) [ 767 ] Fifth Avenue, the General Motors Building, which is being conducted by our partners. We believe that there is a deal that has been made with a valuation that is in excess of the 96.5% of the $3.4 billion value, which was the ropo [ph] price asked. We haven't actually seen what the final deal is, but that's what we're told. As a reminder, the asset was purchased in 2008 for $2.8 billion and is currently financed with a $1.6 billion mortgage at the rate of 6% with a 2017 maturity. Without adjusting for the current above-market debt structure, this works out to a 50% increase in the equity value of the asset over the last 4.5 years.","Let me start to give you a little bit of commentary on sort of what's going on in the markets now and shift away from the asset side -- the sales side. As Mort suggested, from a macro perspective, things continue to be sluggish. But as we think about the world, we're really thinking about where the tenants are that are going to grow and where in the foreseeable future likely increases in jobs are going to be. Job growth in the U.S. economy today is clearly focused on businesses that are oriented toward new ideas, be it in technology, media and information distribution, life sciences or medical devices. In a general sense, the markets that have the large concentration of those industries, San Francisco being one of them, are clearly going to be the strongest performers. And those are the areas that have the most opportunity for occupancy improvement and ultimately rental rate growth.","So let's start with San Francisco. The technology industry has become a major user of CBD office space, taking up more than 23% of the available inventory in the CBD, which is a market of about 58 million square feet. Tech demand in the city continues to be very strong. Uber, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo!, WeWorks, Square and AppDynamics are looking for large blocks of space right now in the CBD in San Francisco. Tech tenants continue to lease more and more space into additional high-rise office buildings. They've taken space in 50 Fremont, in Rincon Center, in One Market Plaza, in One Montgomery, in 199 Fremont, in 333 Bush, and more recently, many of the newly announced developments, including our assets at 680 Folsom Street.","We have now begun responding to offers on our remaining availability at 50 Hawthorne, which is the 3-storey building directly behind 680 and 690 Folsom. And the rents that we are putting out there are generally 5-plus percent higher than our initial underwriting, and our transaction costs are about 15% lower than our budgets. And we are seeing pretty strong activity.","Tenants in San Francisco are now entering the market, where there is very little sublet availability. The direct vacancy for Class A space is under 8%. And many, many tenants are coming off leases that were done during the last downturn 10 years ago. In fact, we just completed a 40,000 square foot early renewal -- 2014 expiration -- with a tenant that came to the low-rise Embarcadero Center in 2004. The new rent is 23% higher than the expiring rent, and there were limited transaction costs. In the second transaction, we completed a full-floor deal that was last done in 2009 with a 10% bump in the mark-to-market, again with limited transaction costs. Our 2013 to 2015 mark-to-market at EC is really running between 15% and 25% on a lease by lease basis.","We've commenced construction on 535 Mission Street, which is a speculative building, 535,000 square feet. And it's going to be delivered in the middle of 2014 with occupancy by the end of 2014. We introduced the product to the market about 2 weeks ago and made it clear we would be responding to leases of 2 floors or more. The square footage is actually 307,000 square feet, not 325,000 or 335,000.","We're very encouraged by the initial reviews and inquiries. The building has 13,000 square foot floors. So we anticipate that it's really going to be leased to a broad range of small or medium-sized technology and legal and financial services and other tenants. And if the average leases in the building hit our pro formas, we expect that in the mid 60s, the investment will generate about a 7% cash NOI return. And if it's higher than that, obviously, a much higher return on costs.","We did, as Mort said, close on the 95% position at the Transbay site during the quarter. We originally contemplated the transaction as a 50% partner. And at this time, we are considering whether and when we might want to bring in a capital partner for the transaction. But really, we're focusing our time at the moment and working as expeditiously as possible with Hines on our initial construction activities with an objective of spending the incremental capital necessary to shorten the project delivery schedule. That's what we're focusing on right now.","The pace of activity in the valley and the peninsula continues to be strong, although there was a pause from the last quarter and actually a little bit of negative absorption as a bunch of speculative office buildings have come on the market. But again, things have started to pick up in March and April. Apple and Google are once again looking for incremental growth out there. And there have been a significant number of other medium-sized tech tenants that are making commitments to signing leases.","There is a healthy level of activity, and rents for new buildings are basically in the 325 to 375 area. That's a triple net monthly number for markets like Santa Clara and Sunnyvale. And we have seen, again, a pickup in activity in Mountain View, where our asking rents are in the $2.50 range and up. Again, our buildings are one-story buildings. Our last deal was completed during the first quarter. It was for 30,000 square feet at $2.63 monthly, which has worked out to $31.56 triple net.","Boston, which has its life sciences industry, continues to exhibit some really strong growth. Tenants are expanding into lab and office space across Cambridge and Boston and the Route 128 market. And while the epicenter of the life science community is still in Cambridge, where we have a number of the sort of nonprofit institutes and think tanks like Broad and Whitehall (sic) [Whitehead] and MIT, we continue to see great activity across the overall market.","Over the last decade, a number of traditional office buildings in Kendall Square in Cambridge actually have been converted to lab space. And while that has reduced and increased -- reduced the amount of office square footage and reduced the ability for tenants to grow there, there still happens to be the most concentrated technology demand in the Boston area in Cambridge. And it's really become a critical location for a number of large technology companies putting office space at a premium. Surprise, surprise, we are effectively 100% occupied in Cambridge Center.","Now last month the City of Cambridge gave MIT the right to develop about 1 million square feet of commercial space across from our Cambridge Center development. There are no definitive plans at the moment, and that could be lab space, it could be retail space or it could be office space. In addition, the city is working with us on changes to the Kendall Square zoning that could allow us to build up to 1 million square feet on our parcel at Cambridge Center in the future. Where does it go? It probably goes on top of garages or potentially knocking down some of our smaller buildings.","Finally, the city is also examining the Department of Transportation owned site on the north side of Cambridge Center for additional commercial density. So there will be some additional office and lab opportunities in Cambridge in the sort of medium term and nothing in the short term.","So today, what are we doing in Cambridge? We're trying to engage tenants with either '14, '15 or '16 expirations about renewing. And quite frankly, in some cases we're actually encouraging some of our tenants to consider opportunities in our properties in the Back Bay or in 100 Federal Street or in the suburbs.","So at the Hancock Tower, which is our largest medium-term exposure in Boston, we focused on widening the user market and have created effectively a white box showcase on one of the floors, which really we hope is appealing to the technology-focused tenants. The space is actually priced at lower rents than the opportunities in Cambridge today. Tech tenants are finding their way into the Back Bay and the financial district. It is happening. We're showing the Hancock Tower to Cambridge brokers and tenants on a pretty consistent basis. The only challenge we have, quite frankly, is that we don't get most of the space back until 2015, and many of the tech companies have a much shorter duration window than that.","Now while many of the real estate pundits are focusing on the urbanization of businesses in the Boston market, we continue to see really, really strong activity in our Waltham assets, and much of it is stemming from the expansion of the life sciences industry. During the quarter, we completed 88,000 square feet of leasing at Bay Colony, which included 76,000 square feet of new demand. And we're in negotiations with 2 more tenants for another 55,000 square feet of current availability. We completed more than 77,000 square feet of deals at 230 CityPoint, including 45,000 square feet of new demand from expanding and new tenants. And overall, through the beginning of April, we've done more than 375,000 square feet of new leases in the Waltham market. More than 1\/3 of the demand is from growing life science companies. So again, the Boston markets, led by the biotech and life science industries, are really feeling very good, not just in Cambridge but in the City of Boston, where Vertex is growing, as well as in the suburban 128 in Lexington.","In New York City, the first quarter leasing activity was pretty slow. But since the beginning of March, we have seen a meaningful pickup in demand from high-end smaller tenants. Our predominant user and target tenant for our available space today at 510 Madison and at 540 Madison and at 767 Fifth, the General Motors Building, are small hedge funds and asset management companies, advisors and other entities that are involved in the financial services industry. And what we're seeing is that given the current bull market and the amount of new allocations that seem to be coming out of the pension fund management community, there is aggressively -- that is aggressively being invested, there are new funds being formed and existing funds are starting to grow again.","We signed 5 prebuilts during the quarter, 2 at 510, 2 at 540 and 1 at 599. And we have a total of 5 deals totaling 45,000 -- 40,000 square feet done or in the works at 510 Madison right now. We have 8 deals totaling 32,000 square feet in the works at 540 Madison. We signed 53,000 square feet of leases at the General Motors Building and completed a transaction with a world-renowned luxury retailer for the ground floor space. And we're out to lease with a full floor a 38,000-square-foot tenant. We have 2 deals on the 3 of our -- 2 of our 3 remaining suites at 601 Lexington at Citigroup Center building and filled our last 2 suites at 399 Park Avenue. We have really, really good activity across our portfolio in midtown. Our pricing at 540 is from the mid-70s to the low 90s. The pricing at 510 is from the low 90s to the mid 130s. And our pricing at the General Motors Building is from the low 90s to the upper 190s. Again, strong rents, smaller tenants, prebuilt suites in our portfolio across our midtown assets.","Now the large tenant market in New York City is a bit of a different story. We continue to see headcount reductions from the large investment banks. And as leases expire, these institutions are shedding space. The universe of large lease expirations, in the 200,000 square feet or more is sort of how we'd characterize that, is pretty limited between '13 and '16. And as we just saw with Simpson Thacher, which just renewed about 500,000 square feet at 425 Park a few weeks ago, they had a 2018 lease expiration. So the window now for our large tenant block is 2016 to 2018 and beyond.","Fortunately, we have no available space other than our new development. Our focus at 250 West 55th is on full and multi-floor users, under 100,000 square feet, which is really the deepest part of the market. We're showing space on a consistent basis and are optimistic that in addition to the 46% that's already leased, we will have additional deals signed before the building opens early next year. It should be noted that in spite of a slow market, as evidenced by the sales I described earlier, the demand for New York City real estate investment is as strong as it has ever been.","In DC, the realities of sequestration and the lack of any progress on a real grand bargain are really having an impact on the market more than anywhere else in the country. The first quarter was really a continuation of the end of 2012, where there really wasn't much in the way of net absorption. You have to remember that the GSA makes up about 25% of the square footage in the market there. And if they're not growing and, in fact, today what they're working under is a mandate of increasing the densification of space, i.e. getting into less space with more people, the market is going to struggle.","","Second-generation space is plentiful. And in some cases, landlords have expanded the concessions in the way of either tenant improvements or free rent to encourage tenants to relocate. Fortunately, thanks to our DC team, we just don't have any much in the way of available space. We're 96% leased. And where we do have availability, with one exception at net square per block, we are marketing prebuilt suites to expand the target market. And we're taking advantage of 2 things: one is our building locations, and two is our property management strength. And when you're talking to small tenants, both of those things matter.","We started construction, as Mort said, on 601 Mass Avenue, which is 79% leased, and expect to deliver that building in the fourth quarter of 2015.","The most significant deal in suburban DC this quarter was our lease -- our 20-year lease with ODNI, which is a GSA entity, at Patriots Park. We continue to have great success at attracting tenants to Reston Town Center. In this quarter, we did another 6 additional leases in our Town Center portfolio, totaling about 47,000 square feet. And we continue to achieve rents in the high 40s to the low 50s in the urban core. A quarter-mile away, you're lucky to get $35 a square foot.","We are currently negotiating a number of early renewals and extensions in Reston following our practice of getting way ahead of our lease expirations. We've closed on the last remaining parcel in the urban core, which is currently zoned for about 250,000 square feet of office space. And we're in the process of determining the highest and best use for that ground and how it fits within our long-range plans for our urban core portfolio.","In Princeton, we completed the 78,000 square-foot deal with Otsuka Pharmaceutical that I talked about last quarter. And they've actually continued to expand, taking another 10,000 square feet of short-term space. We are now working with 2 other tenants, totaling about 350,000 square feet, on long-term renewals and extensions. And we have a number of other active discussions under way.","So overall, we completed about 1 million square feet of leases in the first quarter, which is about 25% greater than the first quarter of 2012 on a comparative basis, about 81 transactions versus 76. Our second-generation rent trends were slightly down. And there are really 2 factors to that. The first was we actually did an 11-year deal early renewal in Princeton with $10 of tenant improvements, which served to lower the rent but greatly increased the net effective rent.","And finally, we did a 4-year deal on a piece of space at 111 Huntington Avenue that was encumbered but where the tenant agreed to put in significant capital with the hopes that the encumbrance would lapse. And that impacted our second-generation numbers as well. If you think sort of going forward, our second-generation mark-to-market is really going to be probably in the mid-single digits over the next few years on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","So with that, I will let Mike talk about the earnings. It's a little bit complicated this quarter. And then we'll get to questions.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Doug, just before you start that. I, want to make one other comment here, and that is to announce that Boston Properties has been designated as the owners' representative of providing development management services for the new health and life center -- life science facility in Holliston, Massachusetts for Harvard University, a project that will cost approximately $480 million. And I think this is just an additional testimony to the quality of work that Boston Properties does in developing world-class buildings for leading clients. And that is a huge and very important transaction for us. And I just think this is something that should be added to our mix of today's information to the shareholders.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thank you, Mort, Doug and Owen. I'm going to quickly touch on our activity in the debt market and then go through our earnings and our projections because, as Doug mentioned, there's quite a few things to cover. I'll try to go quickly, though, because I know the call has gotten a little long.","In the capital markets, we had 2 successful transactions. We issued $200 million of perpetual preferred equity at a 5.25% coupon. And we completed a $500 million 10.5-year bond issue at a yield of 3.3%, which equated to a credit spread of 133 basis points over the 10-year treasury. A portion of those proceeds will be used to redeem $450 million of exchangeable notes in mid-May of this year. Based upon our current stock price, the exchangeable notes are in the money, and we expect to issue common shares for the premium. At our current share price, the premium is approximately $36 million, which equates to roughly 330,000 shares. Now 237,000 of those shares are already reflected in our diluted share count, based upon the average stock price for the first quarter.","We have 2 traditional financings in the works. They included the refinance of our $120 million mortgage on 540 Madison Avenue, which we own 60% share of. The mortgage has a rate of 5.2% and it expires in July. We anticipate closing the new loan in June, which will be a floating rate loan priced at LIBOR plus 150 basis points.","We're also in the process of refinancing our construction loan on 500 North Capitol Street, now that the project is complete. And sometime in June, we expect to close about $105 million, 10-year fixed-rate mortgage at the rate of under 4%. Once we complete these 2 financings, we will have no other debt maturities to refinance in 2013, although we do have $750 million of exchangeable notes maturing in February of 2014.","So after redeeming our exchangeable notes in May, our cash balance will be approximately $700 million. We expect to use $325 million in our development pipeline through the remainder of 2013. The proceeds from the sale of 125 West 55th Street and 303 Almaden are expected to increase our cash by $200 million. And as Doug stated, we're considering several additional property sales that could raise significantly more capital and could be redeployed in our development pipeline, fund acquisition opportunities, repay maturing debt or if required, fund a special dividend.","Now turning to our first quarter earnings results, we reported funds from operations of $1.06 per share that was $0.14 per share below the midpoint of our guidance range. Our earnings were negatively impacted by a couple of unbudgeted charges. The largest was a $19.5 million or $0.12 per share charge to our G&A, the result of implementation of our succession planning.","The G&A charge has 2 pieces relating to our Chairman's transition agreement. First, we took a $12.9 million charge this quarter associated with accelerating outstanding unvested long-term equity compensation. This compensation was previously scheduled to vest and be expensed over the next 4 years. Second, we booked an expense of $6.6 million for the first quarter vesting of the $17.8 million transition benefit payable in cash and stock on January 1, 2015. The remainder of the benefit will vest over the next 14 months, and we project expensing $7.2 million in the last 3 quarters of 2013 and $4 million in 2014.","The other unbudgeted item for the quarter was an impairment charge related to our holdings in downtown San Jose, California. We're taking a $3.2 million charge to net income this quarter relating to the pending sale of the 303 Almaden building, as our book value is higher than the sales price. As Doug mentioned, the building has a major tenant with a lease expiration in 2016, so the leasing was a little bit uncertain and going forward into the future in a market that we see as fairly weak. Now this charge did not impact our FFO as it's excluded per NAREIT's definition.","In connection with the sale, we're reviewing our strategy for the adjacent land parcel that can support 840,000 square feet of office development. Based upon a shorter likely hold period, we booked an $8.3 million or $0.05 per share impairment expense, writing the land down to $29 million, which did negatively impact our FFO. After adjusting for these 2 unbudgeted items, our core operations were above our guidance for the quarter by $0.03 per share or about $5 million. The portfolio was up approximately $4 million. with rental revenues and parking revenues up by nearly $1 million each. The most significant piece of the rental revenue performance was due to the early delivery of the second Patriots Park building to the DIA. The remainder of the outperformance was just over $2 million of lower net operating expenses.","Our joint venture portfolio also outperformed, contributing $2 million above our projections due to the combination of better-than-projected percentage rent from the Apple Store to GM Building and lower operating costs. These positives were offset by the modest amount of termination income we booked this quarter, which was $1 million below our budget.","I want to spend a few minutes now on our full year projections and clarify the impacts from the events in the first quarter as well as the property acquisitions and dispositions that we've announced. Looking at our FFO projection for 2013, excluding the impact of the changes to our G&A and the impairment, we anticipate stronger FFO than our prior guidance. And in fact, we'll be increasing the midpoint of our 2013 guidance estimate by $0.09 per share. The portfolio performance continues to improve, given the leasing activity we're seeing in our vacancy in suburban Boston, Western Virginia and in New York City that Doug talked about. Our occupancy moved up by 30 basis points this quarter to 91.7%. And we expect that it will continue to move up through the year on average between 92% and 93%.","In our same-store, we project our 2013 GAAP NOI to be higher than 2012 by 2% to 3%. This is a 15-basis-point improvement from last quarter's guidance due to projected occupancy improvement from new leasing activity. On a cash basis, we project our 2013 cash NOI to be up from 2012 by 5.5% to 6.5%, which is in line with last quarter, as most of the new leases have some amount of free rent.","Our noncash straight line and fair value rents are projected to be higher than our guidance last quarter. The uptick in our portfolio performance is expected to add to our straight-line rents. And the addition of the Mountain View properties that have below-market rents increased our fair value rent by about $1.2 million. In total, we project our 2013 noncash rental revenue to be $57 million to $65 million.","As Doug described, we announced 2 new dispositions this quarter as well as the acquisition of our partner's interest in the 2 office parks in Mountain View. Net-net, the impact of these transactions will be about $2.4; million positive to FFO in 2013. The acquisition of the Mountain View properties is projected to add $14.7 million, while the sale of 303 Almaden is anticipated to result in the loss of $2 million of 2013 FFO.","The FFO contribution from our joint ventures is projected to be down $5 million to $6 million due to the sale -- the anticipated sale of 125 West 55th Street and the consolidation of Mountain View. These 2 events are expected to result in a loss of $10.3 million of FFO from our joint venture portfolio. Now offsetting this loss is $4 million to $5 million of projected incremental FFO for the year from new leasing at the GM Building, including our leasing of the ground floor retail space plus other leasing activity at both the GM Building and 540 Madison. Our projection for the full year FFO contribution from the joint venture portfolio is $110 million to $115 million, which includes $55 million of noncash fair value rental income.","We expect the contribution of our development deliveries to be in line with our prior projections. This quarter, we fully placed in service and seized interest capitalization on 500 North Capitol, Annapolis Junction 6 and Two Patriots Park. In July, we expect to deliver 17 Cambridge Center and the Cambridge Center connector building, both of which are fully leased. At stabilization, we project these 5 projects to deliver an aggregate cash return of over 10% on $225 million of invested capital.","Our other developments that are nearing completion include the Reston residential project, 250 West 55th Street, Annapolis Junction 7 and 680 Folsom Street, which we'll deliver in late 2013 through early 2014. We're not projecting any meaningful income generation in 2013, and we expect to continue to capitalize interest on these projects until 2014 when leases start comments.","Our hotel property was up slightly in the first quarter. We expect it to be in line with our prior guidance for the full year, contributing NOI of between $10 million and $11 million to the year. We project our 2013 development and management services income to be $27 million to $31 million. This is up slightly from last quarter's projection.","As Mort mentioned, this quarter we signed an agreement to be the fee developer for the new health and life science facility with Harvard Planning and Project Management. This is a 6-year project, and we expect to start earning income next quarter. The impact is partially offset by the loss of fees from the Mountain View properties, where we previously have been generating management and leasing fees relating to the joint venture but we now own 100%.","Our G&A in 2013 will be significantly higher than previously projected due to the management succession plan put in place in the first quarter. The net impact on 2013 from the plan will be an increase in our G&A of $24 million in 2013 and $4 million in 2014, the majority of which are noncash equity compensation vesting expenses. The charges will be fully expensed by the second quarter of 2014. If you pull out the transition compensation, our 2013 G&A run rate is in line with our prior projection of $82 million to $84 million. Inclusive of all the charges, we project our 2013 G&A expense to be $106 million to $108 million.","We are executing on our financings at better-than-projected interest rates, which reduces our interest expense projection slightly. In addition, during the quarter, we added 535 Mission Street in San Francisco as a new development, and we increased our ownership share of the Transbay Tower project. We are capitalizing interest on both of these projects. And it results in approximately $8 million of higher projected capitalized interest. Our interest in other income is in line with our projections. And in aggregate, our net interest expense is projected to be for $374 million to $380 million for the year. Capitalized interest is projected to be $67 million to $73 million.","This quarter, we completed our first perpetual preferred equity issuance, which was not in our projections, so we will have an increase in our preferred dividend of $7.9 million in 2013. Our prior FFO guidance for 2013 was $5.08 to $5.16 per share. Excluding the earnings impact of our succession planning and the first quarter impairment charge, we will be increasing our guidance by $0.09 per share at the midpoint to $5.16 to $5.26 per share. The improvement includes $0.08 per share better-than-projected performance in the portfolio and $0.01 of lower interest expense net of the preferred dividend. The charge associated with our succession planning and the first quarter impairment combined for a loss of $0.19 per share of FFO and results in our new guidance range for 2013 funds from operation of $4.97 to $5.07 per share. For the second quarter, we project funds from operation of $1.25 to $1.27 per share.","I do want to mention one other thing, which is the potential impact that the sale of the minority interest in the GM Building could have on us going forward. As part of the transaction, we've been asked to make accommodations to the new partners and in return have negotiated enhanced operational control rights, which may lead to our consolidating the asset on our books. If we consolidate, the accounting will reflect that we have sold our interest in the joint venture, resulting in a substantial gain. And then we would record the asset as an acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at the new higher market valuation. In addition, we would recalculate the fair value accounting for the building and including both the leases and the debt. We anticipate that this will result in a decline in our noncash fair value rental income and a decline in noncash fair value interest expense. The net effect on our FFO will likely not be significant in 2013, but the geography of the changes will reduce our revenues and our interest expense. None of this impacts the cash economics of our investment, only the accounting.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Josh Attie, Citigroup.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just one for Mort. As you think about the CEO succession and in choosing Owen, how important was sort of the international experience that Owen brings to the table, whether it be Asia or London, and the characteristics that you were looking to bring on in an executive?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, it was one of many diversified talents that Owen brings to the table. I think for the shorter term, we're going to focus pretty much on the United States as the main market for not only our current assets, obviously, but for growing our assets. But as you may know, we looked and spent a good deal of time looking for investments in London. And we actually had signed an agreement to buy a building, which we terminated when it turned out the seller did not own all the building, as he had represented. But setting that aside, it's still an interesting market for us, and I think that it will be something that we would consider. But I have to say, we still think by far and away, the vast majority of all our activities will be here the United States. We are in a very few markets in the United States. For specific reasons, we will be continuing to look for other markets, where we will find the characteristics that we have previously found worked so well for us. And I think that's where Owen's time and my time and Doug's time, in terms of expanding our efforts and focusing on new acquisitions and new development, I think that's by far and away where the main focus will be.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Doug, just a quick one for you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're working with Hines to shorten the delivery schedule on Transbay. Can you just talk a bit about how you will likely proceed on that project, whether how much capital you're going to put in before having any leases in place? Do you envision this going spec? And I guess how much can you shorten this delivery schedule, in terms of timing?","Douglas T. Linde","So what we're -- the plans we're currently working on, Michael, are two: going to the ground and then go up to grade. And that probably eliminates somewhere between 10 and 14 months of time, depending upon when we get started. And once we get there, we'll have an interesting question to ask ourselves, which is how do we feel about the activity at 535 Mission, how do we feel about the other activity in the city, what pre-leasing commitments might we be able to make or have we made. And we'll sort of go from there, and it's a work in progress.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the total dollars spent to get to that point is?","Douglas T. Linde","It's probably another $120-plus-or-minus-million dollars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Mort, can you help me understand how the board thought about the nearly $20 million on exit payments to be paid to you?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I'll give you my best version of it. Obviously, I think that this was something that was anticipated to ensure a well-managed transition and also to recognize, if I may say this, I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, that the kinds of services that I have previously rendered to the company may continue to be rendered to the company as we go forward. That's certainly my intention. So I will continue to focus primarily on expanding the company's, either sites or buildings, for the next several years. And then, we'll see where we are at that point. But I think that was basically the hope and the idea that I would continue to perform in that role, not just by myself but at least taking the lead in all of this. And that, I think, was the rationale.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a capital allocation question. Can you just update us on how you're thinking about acquisition opportunities in the marketplace as you recycle capital? Obviously, you have a big development pipeline and that could grow significantly over time. Is it still the case that you'd significantly favor development over acquisitions?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes, I think that's still our principal focus because we -- frankly, that is sort of  the core competency of this company. It doesn't mean that we won't be looking for acquisitions because that, again, is as we have demonstrated with a lot of buildings, from the General Motors Building to buildings in Washington to the John Hancock building, even to Prudential Center, there are a lot of situations where we feel we can go into an existing building and improve the building and improve its attraction as a building to be occupied and therefore, over time, to really do very, very well. Secondly, to be very blunt about it, because we have the financial resources and the credit to buy buildings and to actually lease buildings and to finance buildings, we think there will still be the opportunity for us to buy buildings with an appropriate spread between the yield at which we buy the buildings and the yield at which we can finance the building. And this will, it seems to me, over the long term, if we pick the right buildings, as I think we have done for most of our history as a company and both as a private company and a public company, that this will continue to enhance the asset base of the company. Obviously, it's a mix between acquisitions of existing building and development sites. And that's still going to be the basic approach. The strategy that we have always followed and will continue to follow is to really focus, again, on certain critical markets where we think we have the best long-term demand and to end up with buildings that are in extraordinary locations and that are extraordinary buildings or can be brought to that level by reason of our ownership. So that is what we do the best and what we have done well, and we will continue to try and focus on that. It's not easy finding these sites or these buildings, and I think this is something that a lot of us spend a lot of time on and I, particularly, have spent most of my time on. And that's, I think, going to be the continued focus for the next several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Doug, I just want to ask you a couple of questions relative to your comments on tenant concessions. How would you quantify these specifically in -- relative to some of the strong demand you're seeing in San Francisco on the large block space, particularly the suburban kind of Waltham assets? Are you seeing material reductions in TIs -- TI requests from tenants at this point?","Douglas T. Linde","So in a market like San Francisco, on renewals, we are seeing a dramatic shift in the concession packages that are necessary to convince those tenants that they should stay because the alternatives they're looking at are having to come out of pocket because the market concession packages for new tenants hasn't really gone up at all, with a likely significant higher rent. So to the extent that the current installation works for them with relatively short money, they're in pretty good shape. In the suburban Boston market, we've seen, I'd say, a modest change in the concession packages for new tenants. It's stickier at sort of $40 to $50 a square foot for a 7- to 10-year lease, but the rental rates have probably gone up by $2 or $3 a square foot or somewhere between 7% and 10%. If you look at Washington, D.C., I'd say that's where the concession packages are probably most -- the weakest, and there's been the most significant change. And that's largely due to the relatively modest amount of growth that there is, particularly in those marketplaces. And so in order to effectively attract tenants and convince tenants to leave, landlords are putting pretty significant TIs on the board. We've chosen, in the case of our prebuild suites, to really basically build the space out for tenants, which is causing us somewhere between, on the low end, $75 a square foot and the high end, $90 a square foot. But we're -- obviously, we're leasing that space sort of on an immediate basis, and these are smaller tenants who are looking for immediate occupancy. If you're talking about a 40,000 or 50,000 square foot block of space in a building that is a 1990s or 2000s era building, a second generation, the concession package could be well in excess of $90 per square foot, and there could be a year or so of free rent associated with that as well.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just one follow-up on the Transbay question. Given that you're accelerating the process and putting some of the structure on the ground up to grade, do you guys worry about limiting the design of the tower after that? Depending on the type of tenants you get, the insertions of other functions, like hotels and residential, does that limit you in terms of what you can do going forward despite the shortened timeline?","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think it limits us. The volume of the building and the architecture of the building have been pretty much locked down with the city over the past 6.5 years of design that the Hines organization moved forward with. So we sort of have -- we effectively have the volume to work with. And how we use that volume, I think, is very much sort of what we're thinking about right now, as we move forward with the design. And our perspective now is that this is going to be 100% office building, not a mixed-use building, not a collection of retail at the base and hotel above that and then office space or high-end condos. This is going to be a 1.4 million-square-foot office building.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. How do you tie the strong tech tenant demand in San Francisco today to your prospects at re-leasing at Embarcadero? Is there overlap there from your perspective?","Douglas T. Linde","I would say that while we are seeing the tightness in the market, based upon the amount of tech demand in the market impacting Embarcadero Center, the physical nature of the tenants that are looking at Embarcadero Center today continue to be more traditional. We do have a handful of cloud computing and technology-related organizations but not in the same -- with the same amount of activity that we're seeing in traditional financial services firms. There's just -- quite frankly, it's actually not about the space or the configuration of the space, it's about the location. And over on the other side of Market Street -- and remember, there is the south financial district and there's the South of Market, which is really where the focus of the technology tenants has been, which is, quite frankly, why we invested our money in 680, 690 Folsom and 50 Hawthorne, why we're investing our money in 535 Mission and why we're investing our money in the Transbay. Again, about 75% of the market still is traditional financial services, FIRREA, \"old world,\" if you want to call it that, on tenancy. So we're not sort of putting our backside to them. But for the most part, Embarcadero Center continues to be more of a traditional market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector, Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman. I guess starting on a question for Ray. Now that we've seen the sequester take shape, can you give us related thoughts on the longer-term impact on Washington and the Virginia markets and also your latest expectations for government and contract  re-leasing for cybersecurity versus the rest of the defense complex?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Jamie, yes, I think the sequestration has already been baked in, and I think is really related now to the -- just the operating fundamentals of each individual government agency. For instance, as you mentioned, Fort Meade seems to be getting demand. Cybersecurity, as Mort has often opined, is one of the leading areas of concern for our security, and thus, that's where the money is going. The NSA has just come out with 155,000 square foot requirement that probably be competing against [indiscernible] and our buildings up there with Gould's. But for northern Virginia, we're seeing continued contraction on the government side. Even though sequestration may be already considered, the end users are looking how to become more efficient, and that applies not only to the public sector GSA demand but also to the private sector defense contractor demand as well. That's why it was so important for us to get out in front and do deals like the Bechtel  deal and the STG deal and the Cytor [ph] deal, 1.5, 2 years ago. So that has minimal, if any, impact upon us in northern Virginia. I will say that we're a little disappointed in the demand down in Springfield. We thought that with the NGA moving down there they'd have longer coattails and pull out of the demand down there from the defense contractors. But we haven't seen it yet, and that has some impact on VA 95 and our Kingstowne assets.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you think you'll start to see a pickup in demand from government-related now that we've passed it?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, the big question Mark, is how much capacity those tenants already have in their existing portfolio of space in north Virginia. They're going to back tow that before they take any net new. We sure are hoping we get a shot at it. Fortunately, again, as we've stated before, we don't have much vacancy. I think there's others in the market who are hoping they had the opportunity to go out and make aggressive deals with defense contractors. We have just the option of making those deals because we have so little space.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to New York City, I know a big theme on last quarter's call was just discussing the age of existing product versus new product. Can you talk about your latest thoughts on that front, especially given you have seen leasing pickup for your New York portfolio? And then maybe any change in tenant sentiment now that we've seen Coach, SAP and L'Oreal sign space at the Hudson Yards?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, you're -- I'm going to try and answer your questions, although I think sort of -- you've asked a bunch of questions in there. So the small tenant demand  in Midtown Manhattan, I think as was pretty evident by my comments, has really started to pick up again from a velocity perspective, and rental rates are pretty firm. The large tenant demand in the city is a forward market. And as you're well aware, a number of large blocks of space predominantly downtown in the World Financial and the World Trade Center market, plus on 6th Avenue in the bases that some of the older buildings is not an insignificant impact on sort of overall demand in the city for large tenants. And as I said, most of the large users are probably 16 to 20 type of users in terms of when their leases expire. So whatever you're seeing in terms of deal activity, the deal activity that is forward market, not current market, and so the impact of that will be sort of longer term in terms of how they affect the city. I think that you also continue to see growth of smaller tenants in Midtown South, in downtown and now in certain places in and around Times Square that are more technology-related that are going to both Class A as well as some of the lower-quality buildings largely for price purposes as well as, to some degree, because of the environment that are being found there. When you think about the Hudson Yards, that's really a build-to-suit market. It took a long, long time to get that first tower going largely because it was a 4-party deal with Coach and Related and SAP and L'Oreal. And so it just -- and those -- again, those are long-term duration lease expirations that are being dealt with. And as I think -- as you think about what else will be going into that market certainly in the medium term, it's likely to be the build-to-suit market. And so the alternatives are staying in place and becoming more efficient, going to one of the large blocks of space that currently exist, either on 6th Avenue or in Lower Manhattan or going into the new construction in the Hudson Yards or other places, where, in the case of Hudson Yards, there is obviously an impact that you can take advantage of from the perspective of what the tax advantages are that the city is providing for users there. So those are the things that are sort of, I think, working to sort of firm up the city on the small side and in our opinion, sort of create some sense of caution on the large tenant side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","John Guinee here. First, Mort, I've known Owen Thomas for about 20 or 25 years, great hire, congratulations. Second, a smattering of questions in no particular order designed just to kind of clear up some things first. And I'll just give you all of them. Ray, $108 or so per FAR foot sounds like a huge number for Reston Town Center. Perhaps you can comment on that. And then second, probably, Doug, whether the Transbay terminal works or not is -- may or may not be a function of whether the financial service guys migrate from California Street and Embarcadero Center. As you're looking at this, are you expecting Transbay to really hurt the traditional north of market part of the CBD or not? And then, three, probably Doug or Owen, if you look at the next 2 or 3 years, you're clearly increasing your disposition plans. Is this a company that will continue to grow on a square footage basis or will recycle assets more aggressively and stay about the same size?","Douglas T. Linde","Let me start with that and then others can chime in. So just on the first -- on the last question you asked, John, we don't think about growing the portfolio from a square footage perspective. We think about growing the NAV of the company and the earnings per share of the company and the cash flow of the company. So as long as we can do those things, the overall size of the portfolio is really not a consideration. And I think our view today, and as long as we think that the macro economy is going to be where it is and in particular, where the overall ability to borrow debt, i.e. where the Fed and the central banks of the world are keeping interest rates, it's going to be a strong market in which to sell and a difficult market with which to buy, if you have the perspectives that we have, unless there are unique interesting opportunities on an asset-by-asset basis, where we think we could do something to a particular asset that other people may not have the vision or the skill to do. With regards to Transbay, the Transbay site and the location we believe will be a location that is very attractive to both traditional and technology like tenants. It happens to have a floor plate that is an optimal size for technology companies and a window line and a mullion spacing and an overall configuration that is also terrific for traditional financial services companies, as they think about redoing their space in the modern era. And we've talked ad nauseum quarter after quarter about the way people are using space, and it is a very different way of using space than it was 10 years or 15 years ago. And as you look at the lease expiration opportunities in 2016, 2017, 2018 in the city of San Francisco, we would hope that we will be a very attractive alternative to both those existing tenants that currently occupy space on Market Street or in California Street in the traditional marketplace, as well as growing technology companies. And Ray, you can comment on our purchase of the signature site, which I think is where John was talking about his numbers.","Raymond A. Ritchey","Will do, Doug. So John, we bought the site and the associated density, and the associated density has approximately 240,000 to 250,000 square feet of commercial density associated with that site. However, in Town Center, that density is fungible throughout the entire 40 acres that we control, so we have the ability to build an alternative use on the terra firma, the site itself. So let's say we build, for instance, 500 apartment units on that site and then transfer the density elsewhere within the Town Center to other undeveloped sites that may have an existing building on it that we can scrape and go with an office tower. So to have that kind of flexibility to increase the density elsewhere in Town Center and have that critical site to build upwards of 500 apartment units, which, at a price of $60 per unit, would be $30 million to itself. Not only do we think the price is justified, but we think it gives us tremendous flexibility, in terms of anticipating the future needs for both office and residential demand in Reston Town Center.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","May I add something? This is Mort speaking. I just want to remind you that in 2006, in 2007, 2008, we sold an awful lot of real estate. And we also bought an awful lot of real estate. That's when we were able to buy the John Hancock building in Boston, the General Motors Building in New York, et cetera, et cetera. I could go on. But the fact is that we do believe that we will be in a position to take advantage of whatever opportunities come up in the markets. And we have found, particularly the larger and the more complicated transaction, the more opportunity we have because, I think, the market sees us as a company with the sophistication and ability to pull together those kinds of transactions and even more importantly, with the management skills and the financial resources to take on those assets. So we will keep our eyes and ears open for those opportunities. Nobody ever knows with certainty when they come up. But we want to be in a position where we can take advantage of what we think will happen over the next few years, which is that a number of people will feel that they have to sell some of their assets. So we will be, I think, very open to buying additional assets, particularly if those assets are the kind of outstanding prime A assets that we have accumulated over the years. We have no particular ceiling or floor to how many square feet the company should have or what have you. We do think that they're in the nature of the beast that we are involved with, there are times when buildings can and should be sold and can and should be bought and never mind, as well as develop. So this is going to be a business that we have been in for the last 50 years. And I think we'll be able to be in it for a lot of years going forward. These opportunities will always be available, and we will certainly compete with them. We're not the only people competing with them, as I'm sure you realize. So I think we are just going to be in a position to take advantage of whatever opportunities come up, and we've always been sort of players that whenever anything interesting does come up, the market always comes to us when something interesting comes up. So I think we'll be able to do things, even though we can't specifically talk about them at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson, Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Ray, along those lines on the acquisition front, I'm just interested in how much is available. I think a few months ago, you had referred to a reasonable number of assets being sold. Are you seeing any additional cap rate compression for coastal office assets, in general? Is that, in turn, leading to an increase in properties being put up for sale?","Raymond A. Ritchey","I think there's a few landlords and owners that are trying to take advantage of the increasing capital flow into real estate and the lower interest rates. And I do see some additional assets coming for sale, and obviously, we're trying to follow that lead. But I don't see a wholesale selloff. And in fact, I see several landlords reinvest in existing assets to upgrade their current portfolio, as opposed to taking them to the markets. So I don't see a rush to the exits in terms of sale. I see selective opportunities becoming available. Very hard for us to compete with the purchase of these existing assets, and that's why we focus on value add through development, as opposed to going out and trying to compete buying existing buildings.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I'd add the following, too, which is the reason that people are putting their buildings on the market today is that there is an exceedingly strong bid for those buildings from the institutional market from sovereign wealth funds, from high net worth individuals, from sponsors who are taking advantage of the current capital markets and quite frankly, looking out at the world and looking at what the yield opportunities are elsewhere and saying, \"Geez, is real estate a good -- is this a good time to be putting money into real estate and is it an inflation hedge, et cetera?\" And as long as that is the case, you will continue to see high-quality assets being sold and being aggressively bid, and we are experiencing it with the assets that we have on the market. We expect to see it with the assets that we will be putting on the market, and we're seeing it with the stuff that we're looking at. And as Ray said, we struggle to get to an acceptable return on a fully leased building in a coastal CBD that's got no roll over for the next 15 -- 10 or 15 years. Quite frankly, that's what we're selling.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then in D.C., you have a nice lease rate, and it sounds like you're well situated. But is the GSA densification in there focused on becoming more efficient? I'm just curious, is that actually manifesting itself in nonrenewals or is it more just lip service on the part of the GSA?","Raymond A. Ritchey","We were actually the beneficiary with a major renewal. I think one of the reasons that DOJ renewed early and renewed for 15 years at 1301 New York was avoiding debt restructuring, avoiding debt consolidation. And they're very happy there, they're very happy with the current configuration. So they moved early and aggressively and renewed for 15 years to keep their current status in place. I think it has put a lot of people on the sidelines, on other buildings and other landlords. Our position with the GSA is in excellent shape. We were out in the front, and we were aggressive in our pursuit of both ODNI and DIA. And those are kind of poster childs for the consolidation because they were able to move into recently renovated buildings, become highly efficient and make long-term commitments. So that move has actually been benefiting BXP as opposed to hurting us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson, Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Doug, I think you talked to us a little bit when you talked about possibly bringing in a money partner for Transbay. But what level of overall aggregate development is the company comfortable with at this point in time?","Douglas T. Linde","I would tell you that we don't have a limit, given that the reality of the world and the number of projects that we could physically be involved with, given the size of the company's platform, doesn't put any sort of cap on it. There was a point in time, when we were a much younger public company, when we had almost 20% of our total portfolio in development and not leased, where there was a lot of speculative nature associated with that. We're now, what, a $30 billion enterprise, and our current pipeline is about $1.5 billion, growing to $2 billion. So it's a far smaller number. And the opportunities to do development, I think, are prevalent. But as Mort said, there are certain situations where we're going to be much more circumspect about taking leasing risks and being comfortable with significant pre-leasing prior to getting underway. And if that's the case, there's a significant amount of additional capacity, not just in our balance sheet, but in terms of what our appetite will be for.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one for Mike. You talked about the incremental $4 million to $5 million of FFO from leasing at the GM Building. Can you talk about how much of that is the Cartier retail space and sort of where that revenue winds up being on a go forward basis, relative to what CBS was paying?","Michael E. LaBelle","I really can't describe the specifics of where it is. I mean, I can tell you that at the GM Building, we've leased 3 retail spaces, the Cartier space and 2 smaller retail spaces on Madison Avenue, which are helping us. As Doug mentioned, there's a 38,000 square-foot lease we have out for office space in the low rise of that building. And then we are also talking to some tenants in the high rise of that building about early renewals. So that's kind of where the growth is coming from in that space. From the perspective of the CBS space versus Cartier space, there is a decrease from the contribution of CBS to the contribution [indiscernible].","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","[indiscernible] For an outstanding transaction completed with Cartier and we're very, very happy with the number it's in. As we've pointed out, we still have additional space to lease, but we will be very happy when we get that space done at the same kind of numbers that the Cartier people saw. The value of that space is really extraordinary. It's just a one-off kind of space in New York for a high level retail. So we're very, very enthused about it. It's not going to -- there are not too many people like that -- or companies like that, but boy, if somebody comes into the market, they look at whatever limited amount of space we have left.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Is the press reports of that short-term lease, while they renovate their space on 52nd Street, accurate or is that a longer-term lease?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","No. The Cartier leases are the longer-term lease. That's not a short-term lease. No, they're going to be investing a lot of money and we'll be investing some money in that space. And the traffic that is generated by the Apple Store is unprecedented in the history of American retailing. And it's unprecedented for Apple. And that just says something about the location and just the general prestige of that building has and the retail space there. Nobody has ever seen numbers like the numbers that Apple generated in that space, including Apple.","Douglas T. Linde","I just want to clarify. So we're not suggesting that it's necessarily Cartier who's going into that space. And we haven't announced publicly who the tenant is. The tenant is putting a significant amount of money into the space. They do have an ability to go long term on the space. They also have the ability to get out after a relatively short period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Doug, just following up on the disposition outlook for the remainder of the year. It's like the 140 Kendrick and 1301 in D.C. are on market. Are these the only 2 assets that are currently on the market or are there others?","Douglas T. Linde","So you're referring to a story in commercial mortgage alert, or one of these real estate alerts. We haven't announced what properties are on the market yet. We are looking at in excess of 2 buildings. As I said, we're looking at buildings in all of our markets. So the 2 that you described are buildings in 2 of our markets.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Transbay, can you talk a bit about your partner's decision to reduce their exposure there?","Douglas T. Linde","It's a long answer that's necessary, that's why I'm going to try and truncate it, which is effectively as follows. We went to the venture. Hines thought they had a potential equity partner on their side of things. We had to all reach an agreement that, that party was the right party for the deal. At the end of the day, we all came to the agreement that it wasn't the right party for the venture. And we had negotiated the ability to close on the deal as a 95% partner and to think about how we might recapitalize it if we want to recapitalize it with a large third-party institutional capital partner at a later date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan, Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions regarding the Boston market. First of all, the TD Bank garden site, Doug, I wonder what you're thinking is on that site today and whether the increased densification in the East Cambridge has any bearing on what you might do there?","Douglas T. Linde","So the garden site is, for those of you who have -- want to picture it, there's a big open area in front of the current TD Bank garden, which is the old Boston garden site. And that site is -- has a density envelope that is pretty significant. And on the base of that, it would likely be some type of retail, and then there would be a series of towers that would go up on top of it. And there clearly is an opportunity for tenants that are migrating out of Cambridge to look at other places in the city of Boston. One of the issues, quite frankly, that many of those companies have had is price and new construction in a location like North Station because this new construction may not be as economically attractive as some of the other alternatives they might have in the short term. But as the North Station gets better from an overall environment perspective and we start to do other things there, I think it's very possible that there could be an office component at that location, that could be unusual space that could be very attractive to the types of tenants that are, in fact, looking for space in other parts of the city that would have, in the olden days, when rents were lower, have preferred to stay in Cambridge.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So does the increased densification in East Cambridge have a negative impact on the potential demand, would you say, for that site?","Douglas T. Linde","I don't think so. I think it's going to be about price. The new development that's going to go into Cambridge is going to be very expensive as well.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, regarding the suburban markets, kind of a 3-part question in the Western suburbs. You talked about Bay Colony lease activity. I wonder if you could just give us a sense for how the pricing is coming in on that activity relative to underwriting. And then secondly, the Biogen Idec space that I understand, they're going to be leaving to go to East Cambridge to your site. Is that going to be hitting the sublease market? Do you know the timing? And what kind of impact do you expect it might have on the pricing on the market?","Douglas T. Linde","Let me answer the Bay Colony question first. So when we originally underwrote the Bay Colony transaction, we underwrote rents. That would be from the high 20s on what we refer to as sort of the parking space in the lower levels to the mid to high30s on those other spaces. And we are achieving rents of $28, $29 a square foot in the parking space and we're achieving rents of $34 to $35 a square foot on the other space. So we're achieving exactly what we pro forma-ed, but to be honest -- intellectually honest with you, we're 1.5 years behind. So we also built in some growth rate at that time. And we haven't seen -- we haven't gotten the benefit of that growth, so we're delayed. With regards to the space in Weston, our best understanding is that the performance of Biogen Idec has been so spectacular in terms of drug discovery and drug launches that they are growing at a rate that has -- as suggested to us that they have rethought their short-term ability to get out of the space in Weston because quite frankly, there's not enough space in Cambridge right now to absorb all of the people that they are hiring and would like to move. And so while there is some of that space that is still potentially on the sublet market, we're not aware that they are lock stock and barrel moving out of that building any time soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Owen, and to you, Mort, on the successful transition, I wasn't necessarily anticipating the change, when it occurred. So in that context, a quick curious question, Mort, about the nature of a specific provision in the agreement that pertains to the accelerated vesting of the outstanding awards, I guess, in the event you were to terminate your employment. Should we expect any additional changes? Is there anything else we don't know about?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","No. No. The only thing that I think would affect my future, as far as I'm concerned, I'm having fun and I just enjoy the work, I'm still fully engaged. I intend to be that way for a long time unless I get married, and that's something which you can help me on. But so far, that's not a risk.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Quick one on Harvard, the total fees that are expected to be realized?","Douglas T. Linde","We're not going to talk about it. It's a 6-year project. It will depend on how long it ultimately goes and how they choose to change the overall concepts, and it's -- we believe that we're bringing tremendous value to the University. And we're devoting significant resources to it. And we think we've achieved a competition agreement that's fair to both parties.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just my 2 questions. First, just given the growing demand for office product, especially from the private side, do you think that you'd exceed the $1 billion, and do you think that you'd be in a situation where you were going to do a special dividend the way you did previously? Or your view is with these dispositions, whether your 1031 or shelters with the regular dividend, you would not do a special?","Douglas T. Linde","I think it's going to depend on the circumstances. I don't want to get into sort of a magnitude of what we're talking about. As I said, it could be up to or in excess of $1 billion. Obviously, it depends on the collection of assets that we're selling. If we have places to put the capital and we can find ways to 1031 it, we would certainly do that. To the extent that the magnitude of our sales requires us to make distributions, I think we will make a special distribution in lieu of paying a 40% tax on the gains.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","That would set up the Mountain View acquisition as a 1031, so we do have some opportunity to utilize that asset to help the situation.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. But essentially you were pleased with the special dividend last time, so it's something that you may do. The only reason I asked is some of your competitors historically have done special to that. They didn't feel like they got the bang for the buck, so they wouldn't do it going forward, but it sounds like you were pleased with it. Next question is -- and this is either for Ray or for Mort. If you look at what's happening in D.C. politics, it almost seems like where Congress is leading, whether it's the FAA or immigration, there seems to be some bipartisan folks working together. Should we think that there is some thawing among the 2 parties and that things are actually starting to happen? Or are those sort of 2 exceptions?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","My own view is that these are more the exception than the rule. But it doesn't mean that there aren't members in both the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle who understand that there is a growing frustration in the country that our governmental system is not working, that we're not really addressing the major problems, except in the worst kinds of politics, there's a great gap between the Congress and the President in terms of how they work together, so -- and the country understands it. And there's a certain sort of anxiety over it. And I have a feeling that there may be, as the pressure grows, particularly as we get through to the next election, the Congressional election next year, there'll be some desire to have some kinds of achievements on their resumes when they go and face the public. So I think that there will be some improvement, but I don't see a major improvement because frankly, it could only happen at -- with the level of -- when there's the right level of Presidential leadership. And both sides of the aisle and the Congress feel that, that is presently lacking. There are not very good personal relationships and  there is not a sophisticated understanding as to how to work together. You can start taking some people to dinner, inviting some people to lunch, but it's very late in the game. And there's a great deal of anxiety and frankly, there is no real personal connections that so many Presidents in the past have been able to call upon to bring a legislation to fruition. But you'll never know. I mean, somebody could emerge with the ability to bring everybody together. We all hope that's the case. I'm a little bit skeptical at this stage of the game. And I think the -- if I have to put it in the way it works in the Congress, there's a one little phrase I always use, which is the following: that the only time that the world beats a path to your door is when you're sitting in the bathroom. And in that kind of environment, they're all sitting in the bathroom, waiting for someone to come to them, and they aren't coming to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","If I could go back to an observation that you made, Mort, in your opening remarks about new tech tenants taking -- looking for space in San Francisco, I just wonder, how difficult is it to underwrite these tenants? And more specifically, is it causing you to be reserved about the TI spend?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","We look at all of these things very seriously and on a one-off basis. I mean, I'll give you an example. I mean, the company that took 1,300,000 square feet last year in San Francisco alone, 1 company, Salesforce. It's not exactly an old company, as we all know. But that's the level of growth that some of these companies are having in that marketplace. And we'll just have to look carefully at the financials of these firms. I can tell you that these are firms that can raise huge amounts of equity through a public sales of their stock if they wanted, and also have a lot of availability even on the debt side, particularly at the rates that are currently demanded in the marketplace. They're very manageable for these firms. So you have to choose. You're not going to put in a fortune in TIs to a company that really you think has any chance of going upside down. But we've had a lot of experience with that in the Boston area, in particular, and also in the Washington area and previously, in the San Francisco area. This is not something that's new to us. And so I think we'll be able to make the right decision. We've never had any kind of major lease, to my recollection anyhow, that has gone upside down. So we're very careful about that and we generally have space. When we do the space and when we fix up space to the extent that we do it, we also take that factor in mind, that we may want to keep some of these TIs for another tenancy if necessary. And I think that's something that is very much within our sort of management capabilities. And I do think that, look. You look at some of these companies, they've become giant companies in the last 3 or 4 years. And when I say giant companies, I mean companies with huge balance sheets, with a lot of credit and a lot of cash and earning a lot of money. So I think we will have no difficulty dealing with the financial aspects of those kinds of tenants when they come to us.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Is the leased land similar to that which you would expect to find with the more established credit tenant?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","It just varies from tenant to tenant. One of the things that is very different in these companies is their rate of growth is so dramatic and they really anticipate it. So you have to find a way not only to lease them the basic amount of space that they are interested in, but you have to provide them with some kind of expansion space. And so that kind of space, you end up having to lease for shorter terms. And that's a different kind of challenge for us. But frankly, there are also a lot of tenants in the marketplace that will take a shorter-term lease, particularly if that's the only space that we are going to make available to them, given the kinds of company they are. So this is just the normal balancing that we have done over all the years we've been in business. I really don't think this is going to be a problem. And I also will say to you that these companies are growing at such an extraordinary rate and are so unbelievably profitable. That's really hard to believe. Implicit in your question, is it seems to me, a fair concern, yes, they're extraordinarily profitable, but can it last? And that's, I think, a very interesting question that you have to ask and you have to be careful in terms of the kinds of money that you put into TIs and the kinds of TIs that you put in and pay for.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I think we don't need to think back too far before we first saw a boom and bust in San Francisco around in the late- to mid-90s, of course.","Unknown Executive","No, I think we have to be very cautious and careful about that. But by and large, we've almost never had a tenant that's gone upside down with us. We've been very careful about what we do. And we're not looking to make the last $0.25 on a lease. We're much more cautious in terms of whom we lease to and the security of that lease and careful about the investments. So I think we'll continue to be careful, and I don't want to say conservative, but at least prudent.","Michael E. LaBelle","David, so let me just make a couple of comments on that. So the first thing that we do is, is the buildings that we build or the buildings that we buy are buildings that we believe are going to be most susceptible to re-tenanting in a down market. And so fundamentally, the best way that we can alleviate the risks associated with credits going the wrong direction is to know that we have assets that actually have a marketability to have significant universe of tenants in good times and most importantly, in bad times. And Mort has been sort of expounding that view for the better part of the last 45 years at Boston Properties. The second thing is -- and you may recall that in 2008, there were some terminations of leases in high-quality buildings in midtown Manhattan in our portfolio. And we surprised both ourselves and the market by how quickly we relet that space. And those were \"credit tenants,\" A-rated or A minus or AA-rated companies that literally blew up. And so while it's interesting to talk about sort of what the nature of the credit is, you never know anymore what's going to happen. I think that in San Francisco, there are lots of companies that are looking now at more high-quality, better-built space and not necessarily looking at whatever they can find that's the most funky and unusual space. And typically, those tenants have a little bit more maturity associated with them. And so the overall risk profile of those companies in terms of what their funding needs are, are probably higher than what you might've looked at in the sort of dotcom bubble, where people were basically being funded by venture capitalists and as soon as the revenue ran out, they suddenly didn't -- couldn't raise around D E and F of their secured and preferreds. And I think we're in a different environment today in terms of the companies that are being formed and the business plans associated with those companies, and therefore, the revenue is. So overall, I think that we are in a better standing. But that does not prevent us from being exposed to the risks of the volatility of a huge macro downturn in the overall economy and how that impacts San Francisco. So that's still there. But the way we protect ourselves, the types of buildings that we're building, the types of buildings that we buy, those locations in the way that the space is configured.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I have a quick question for Mr. Thomas, if I may. Thinking back on your time at Morgan Stanley is that you developed very extensive contacts with very large pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, I'm sure. Is that something that we might see more into play on your role at Boston as we look forward?","Owen D. Thomas","Yes. I think my experience at Morgan Stanley, both in real estate and also in various leadership positions and with the relationships that I was able to develop there, I hope to be able to use all of that experience for the benefit of Boston Properties going forward.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So tangential to that then, what do you see is the biggest challenge in terms of becoming CEO of a public property company for the first time?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, as I mentioned, the first challenge for me is getting up to speed on Boston Properties. It's a large enterprise with lots of activities going on that you're very familiar with. And what I've been spending my time on is getting up to speed and making up for lost time in that many of our employees here are long tenured.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And once you're up to speed?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, once I'm up to speed, as I've mentioned, Boston Properties is a well managed and successful company. And my intention is to work in partnership with the existing leadership in the company, including Mort, including Doug, Ray Ritchey and others.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya, Jefferies.","Omotayo T.

We're all looking forward to working with him. And I think we are still realistic but optimistic about the future of the business in general. But in particular, I think we still feel we have a unique platform and a unique prestige in the world of commercial real estate that should continue to give us opportunity to both build and buy buildings. And we're still looking forward to doing a lot of that as we immerse ourselves in our various markets.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties second quarter earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bostonproperties.com.","An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Tuesday's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Having said that, I'd like to welcome Mort Zuckerman, Executive Chairman; Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good day, everyone. Look, we are having a quarterly conference call in the context of the general macroeconomic condition of the United States. And if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed, they did a survey of a number of economists who work for major financial firms and there seems to be, amongst those people, in terms of the national economy, a kind of sense of continued decline to the point where the sense is that, in the most recent quarter, the GDP was growing at less than 1%.","But that's, of course, an overall average. And a part of the long-standing strategy of Boston Properties was to focus on certain specific markets, where we felt that these markets would do relatively better than the national economy in good times and in bad times. And frankly, we have also in the way that we focused our efforts within those economies that would be performing relatively better than the national economy, we tried to establish ourselves as the owners of and the developers of buildings in outstanding locations and buildings that would be considered to be the Class A buildings in their respective markets. And I must say that although we are not, of course, happy to be a part of a national economy that is so weak, the basic theory is that the we, in a sense, and strategy that we undertook years and years ago, have been borne out in this, the worst of recessions that we have all experienced since Boston Properties was started over 40 years ago.","So that in the markets that we are in, primarily San Francisco and Washington and Boston and Cambridge and the Boston area, these markets are not just the downtown areas, but the markets in general, and of course, New York, have all been performing relatively better than the overall national economy. In fact, these are perhaps the 4 best cities -- or among the 4 best cities, these 4 markets, and the cities in general have done better than the overall economy. And so we are doing relatively well in relation to the cities, and the cities are doing relatively well to the whole economy. It doesn't mean that the cities will not be invulnerable if there's a major downturn in the economy. But to date, at least, while there has been weakness in the economy, the cities that we are in have not been dramatically affected. In fact, we've been able to grow our activities in these markets. We have had hundreds and hundreds of leases that have come up, and we have been able to sign tenants of good credit into the buildings that we have, since we think we have the A buildings in A locations, and these are the ones that are the least affected. And in one sense, it also reflects sort of a generality about the economy that I'm sure we've all read and heard about. And namely that the best part of the economy is the economy that is dependent upon intellectual firepower rather than either mass employees or brawn. It's brains versus brawn on one level, and the brains in this kind of economy are doing relatively better. And in some cases, relatively much better than the overall economy. Because most of them are growing, and growing strongly, and particularly in the companies and in the locations that are attracted to those -- attractive to those companies. We have, to date, by and large, been able to assemble sites and -- both within the cities and on the periphery of these cities and have continued to do relatively better. I don't want to make any further predictions in that because we are in an unprecedented kind of economic condition and one which is, therefore, unpredictable. But we still see, and as we will report during other portions of this call, that we have a lot of good activity in each one of our markets, and I think we feel that this activity will continue short of a major, shall we say, downturn in the overall economy, and again, nobody knows how that's going to go. But for the moment, we're in many of the markets we're in, servicing those parts of the economy that are growing and not shrinking.","So with that, I would just end my comments and say that we're going to continue to watch the economy very carefully. We're going to watch the individual markets very carefully. We will continue to focus a lot on our financial resources, so that we can not only not be in any danger but, in fact, would be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that often come up in these kinds of markets, just as we did in 2007 and 2008 and 2009, when those companies, which had liquidity and had the ability to raise money through financing, were able to do things that a lot of other companies were not. And we were able to add, particularly, buildings of the highest quality in several of our markets because of the fact that we were viable, we were in good shape. We were not distracted by troubles, and we were able to raise the money. And that gave us the credibility to make a number of acquisitions, as well as initiate some developments.","So in that sense, not that we want everybody else to be hurt or do less well, but it's just we think a fair description of the positioning of the company. And I think that the credibility that the company has from its work over the last almost 5 decades also helps in terms of dealing with people who want to sell buildings or people who own land that they would like to see developed and want to have the confidence that the programs that we are proposing for these people, particularly if there's any kind of joint venture in it, will in fact be realized.","So I think that we are not overwhelmingly enthused, shall we say, about the overall economy. But I think we still feel a solid degree of confidence about the progress that the company has made and will continue to make, even though we think these overall macro environment is not as supportive as, frankly, as it has ever been. And I've been through our entire history other than the last few years.","So with that, I think I'll end my comments and turn it over to my colleagues.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay, thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone. This is Owen Thomas, and I'm joined here in Boston by Doug Linde, Mike LaBelle and several other colleagues.","Before I get started, I wanted to note an important event that we have going on here in Boston today. That is, today is Doug Linde's 50th birthday, and I wanted to -- I didn't want to start the call without wishing you, Doug, a very happy birthday on behalf of everyone at Boston Properties.","Douglas T. Linde","I really appreciate that, Owen. Very good.","Owen D. Thomas","Any hope you had of this being a secret event is now over.","Anyway, moving to more serious matters. Myself, Doug and Mike will provide more color on the operating environments that we are experiencing. We will outline our current positioning from a capital allocation perspective and describe our performance and results for the second quarter.","So as Mort described, we are experiencing a sluggish recovery in the overall U.S. economy. However, this recovery is multi-speed, depending on industry and specific location. As you know, we are focused on 4 primary geographic areas. And fortunately, in most, though not in all, the markets we serve, we're experiencing reasonably sustained economic recovery and leasing activity. Industries such as technology, life sciences, health care and even smaller scale financial services firms are performing well and creating demand for our properties.","In the second quarter, we executed 77 leases, representing 970,000 square feet, with reasonable balance in leasing across our portfolio geographically.","Our properties in the aggregate are 92.1% leased, which is up from 91.7% leased at the end of the first quarter. Doug will be providing more detail on our leasing activities later in the call.","In terms of capital strategy, we're experiencing what I would describe is an atypical economic and real estate capital market cycle. What I mean by this is interest rates have been at historic lows, creating strong capital flows into the property markets well ahead of an underlying property market recovery. Cap rates are very low, while rent growth is still in early stages. This is particularly true for the quality of assets and markets that are essential to our strategy.","What this means for us, from a capital allocation perspective, is that we are finding new acquisitions challenging. We continue to aggressively pursue acquisition opportunities, but we will also remain disciplined. In fact, as you know, we have viewed the current capital market environment as an opportunity to monetize selected assets, either because of their long-term fit in our portfolio or because of the premium pricing for a particular asset we think we can achieve in the marketplace. We have made good progress in our dispositions in the second quarter, and Doug will also provide more details on this.","Our selected disposition activity will continue, provided the current capital market conditions are sustained.","In many of our markets, buildings are being sold for more than their replacement cost. Given this fact and our promising development sites, the majority of our new investment capital is currently funding development. We currently have 8 assets under construction, representing total investment of $2.5 billion, plus a number of additional projects where we control sites and are pursuing tenants. As the economy improves, we believe these projects will provide shareholders with attractive growth.","Lastly, the most significant economic news for the quarter was a nearly 100-basis-point rise in the 10-year U.S. treasury. We were able to complete the $700 million financing on attractive terms before the full effect of the rate rise. Also, despite the rate rise, interest by investors in purchasing real estate remains robust, though pricing at the margin for leveraged buyers has likely been negatively impacted to some degree.","Thank you. Now let me turn over the conversation to Doug.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, everybody. I hope that you can hear me now that I'm so old and my voice starts to tremble when I'm speaking. Good morning.","The press release does a pretty good summary of describing our capital activities, but I thought would just add a couple of color commentary thoughts to that.","So the first thing is that we signed our agreement for the sale of 1301 New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. for $135 million. This is a, I guess a B+ building. It's fully leased to the GSA, flat lease with a 2029 lease expiration and the in-place cash NOI is about $7.2 million. So that results in a cap rate of 5.3%. The sale has been set up as a reverse-like kind of exchange, which means we are fortunately able to retain all the proceeds from this sale.","Second, we unwound our joint venture activities with related on Eighth Avenue and 46th Street, which was also detailed in the press release. And I just -- I want to be able to color on that. Effectively, we really couldn't come to an acceptable valuation on the remaining parcels of the assemblage. And so as a partnership, we decided to sell the parcels. So to date, in 2013, our gross asset sales have been about $690 million. When we were at NAREIT a few months ago, we described that we were in discussions on the sale of Times Square Tower. This transaction could ultimately be in the form of a 100% sale or a partial interest with a new joint venture partner. The investor interest is robust. Pricing is in line with our expectations, and we are going to refrain from making any specific comments on who the buyer -- buyer or buyers -- that we're talking to might be or the pricing, until we have signed agreements. In the case of this asset, it is not set up as a 1031, so any gain would likely result in a special dividend.","Our current sales activities, as Owen described, have taken place in this rapid increase in treasuries. This is to sort of give you a little bit of an indication of how that's impacted things. At 1301 New York Avenue, there is about a 50-basis-point rise in rates sort of from the time that we announced that we were selling a deal to when we actually chose a buyer. Again, it's a flat lease with no increase for 16 years, so really this is probably the type of asset that you would expect to be exceedingly sensitive to overall fundamental fans in rates. We still had strong interest, and we actually achieved the midrange of our projected pricing. Our view is that the pricing might have been marginally higher, somewhere between 3% and 4% or $5 million. And with that, with the recent movement in interest rates, that would've maintained approximately the same sort of leverage of return for the leveraged investors that were looking at the building. But again, there might have been some additional resistance on a per-square-foot basis. And again, this is a building that is a B+ building, not an A+ building, and it was sold for $671 a square foot.","We did in fact have 2 new partners join us at the General Motors Building this quarter, Soho China and an entity controlled by the Safra family. The actual purchase price was $3.356 billion, which was less than 1% of the number that was given to us as a [indiscernible]. As a reminder, we purchased the asset in '08, $2.8 billion, and it's financed with $1.6 billion of debt at a rate of 6% with a 2017 maturity. So if you exclude any adjustments from the above-market debt structure, it's about a 50% increase in equity over the past 4.5 years, 5 years. Mike's going to spend some time, probably more time than you would prefer, talking about the implications of the change of the General Motors Building from consolidated -- nonconsolidated to consolidated when we move on in the call.","Getting to the leasing and sort of what's going on from an operating perspective. In general terms, I think I would characterize the way we're feeling as cautiously optimistic about our markets. Remember, as everyone previously has said, we are concentrated in markets and submarkets that are concentrated from a tenancy perspective businesses that are into new ideas, be it in technology or media or information distribution or mobility or life sciences or pharmaceuticals and medical devices. And those are the types of businesses that are, in fact, flourishing and increasing their headcounts.","There are clusters of businesses in these markets, and they all coexist with a large pool of talented labor, and this is really where the economy in the United States is expanding. There do continue to be headwinds against more rapid improvements in the office business, and the strongest force of that is densification. I guess you could also refer to that as a productivity improvement or productivity enhancement. In one way or another, businesses are finding ways to fit more people into less space. Organizations are moving from offices and cubes to trading desks, and offices and cubes are getting smaller, and traditional support functions are either being eliminated or consolidated.","The other governor on improvements in the office economics is new supply. New construction activity is a reality, and, quite frankly, it's partly due to the low interest rate environment and the lack of inflation, which is really making new construction much more affordable than you would otherwise think. And it's happening in all of our markets. In many cases, we have major large tenants that are moving into new installations, and they're creating negative absorption. So we're fighting those 2 headwinds.","Getting into our markets, specifically. In Greater Boston, this quarter, we delivered 17 Cambridge Center to Biogen. It was actually 9% under budget. We used none of our contingency, and it was delivered earlier than expected, so we had interest expense savings as well, as well as the Connector Building to Google. Cambridge, which is at the heart, the confluence of both life sciences and technology companies, and it is in an exceedingly supply-constrained geography, is probably one of the strongest markets in the country. We are 100% occupied. So we've begun to engage tenants on our 2014 and our '15 and our '16 lease expirations. We have about 140,000 square feet of late 2014 expirations and 210,000 in late 2015 expirations, and there is significant opportunity for revenue increases from all that maturity.","At the Hancock Tower, we are in lease negotiations with 4 existing tenants totaling about 300,000 square feet on relocations in the building, which is a really great start to covering our December 2014 to early 2016 lease expirations of about 830,000 square feet. And that is, by far, our largest exposure in the Boston area. The base at the Hancock Tower is actually priced less than opportunities in the space we have in Cambridge. Tech companies are finding their way into the Back Bay and the financial district of Boston. And quite frankly, one of our challenges is that we actually don't have possession of any of the space at the base of the Hancock Tower until the beginning of 2015 because it's currently leased and being used by State Street bank. So the technology companies, which have a much shorter window from a decision-making perspective, are less interested in that space right now because they can't get access to it.","The suburban Boston market has been, by far, our most active market during the first half of '13. During the second quarter, we completed 250,000 square feet of leasing. They included a 55,000 square foot lease with a biopharma company in Lexington, a 33,000 square foot lease with a pharma company at Bay Colony, and a 28,000 square foot lease with another technology company at Bay Colony. All of these are net expansions in our portfolio.","We have a growing pipeline of deals in negotiation, including another 50,000 square foot for a tech company that is relocating and expanding at Bay Colony.","We actually competed for a 280,000 square foot build-to-suit for TripAdvisor in Waltham. Unfortunately, we lost that deal, and they're staying closer to their existing facility in Needham. But as a consolation prize, we leased 46,000 square feet because they're expanding and have outgrown their existing facility at our 140 Kendrick Street project.","Again, new buildings are being built. There is expansion, and there is growth in our market. While many of the real estate pundits are all focusing on the urbanization of businesses, we continue to see strong activity in our suburban Boston assets, and it's stemming from the expansion of life science and tech companies.","The pace of activity in San Francisco in the CBD is actually slightly behind where it was last year. Although, you have to remember that 2012 ended with a very large expansion by Salesforce that really impacted the overall transaction market. Current demand from tech companies, as a percentage of demand, has actually gone down from about 2\/3 of the demand in 2012 to about 50% of what's going on today. And the real reason for that are there are more traditional users in the market, as the wave of leases that we've talked about that are going to be expiring between 2014 and 2017 have started to hit the market.","We are responding to offers on our remaining availability at 680 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne, that's about 50,000 square feet, where our expected rents are about 5% higher than our original underwriting and transaction costs are about 50% lower than our budget.","As the lease expirations that are driving the market today start to occur, there seems to be a wide gap between tenants' expectations and owners' expectations of where the economics should be for renewal, primarily in the better buildings and at the tops of the premier buildings. It's clear the tenants are prepared to pay mid-to-high 50s to low 60s for space in the low and mid-rise in the better buildings. But view space rent quotes are now in the mid-70s to over $90 a square foot. There have been a few small renewals in the view space, but the market pricing is slowly being accepted, not rapidly. Tenants in San Francisco are entering the market, where there's little sublet availability, direct vacancies under 7%, and there are lots of tenants that are coming off leases that were done in the last downturn. So there's a lot of sticker shock out there.","We continue to market the 3 floors that we have in the high rise EC4, and they have been available for an extended period. We are optimistic, given the level of activity, that we will get leasing done.","We did one major multi-floor renewal this quarter, 40,000 square feet, with a 2014 expiration in the mid-rise, low-rise of Embarcadero Center 4 -- Embarcadero Center 3, and it was about 23% higher than the expiring rent, and it had limited transaction costs. If you look at our mark-to-market in San Francisco between 2013 and 2015 on a lease-by-lease basis, it runs between 15% and 25% positive.","The construction of 535 Mission is moving along, and we expect to deliver space to tenants in the middle of 2014, with the occupancy by the end of that year. We are encouraged by the initial inquiries, and tenants are starting to space claim the building and like what they're seeing. Again, this is a building with 13,000 square foot floors, so we expected it's going to be leased by a broad range of small to medium-sized tech companies, legal and financial services. If we average -- have lease starts in the mid-60s, this will generate about a 7% cash-on-cash return.","Transbay design work is progressing, and we actually expect to award the subsurface work and commence this phase of construction later this summer. To repeat what we've said previously, we're working on our initial subgrade and foundation construction activities with an objective of spending the incremental capital necessary to shorten the project delivery schedule. The construction should commence shortly, and we expect this phase of work to end in the fourth quarter of 2014. It will require an incremental investment of about $130 million. We will evaluate the pre-leasing activity and the state of the market during the next 17 months, and we'll make further decisions at that time.","The pace of activity in the Silicon Valley and the Peninsula actually bounced back pretty strongly during the second quarter, largely due to expansions from Google. There are now a number of speculative developments underway, which are adding high-quality and high-priced products to the market, and new construction pricing is somewhere between $3.25 and $3.75 per month in markets like Santa Clara and Sunnyvale. We've seen again a pickup in activity at Mountain View, where our asking rents are starting at $2.50 and going up. The last deal we did during the quarter was 24,000 square feet and had a starting rent of $2.90 per square foot.","At our office building in Mountain View and El Camino, we did an early renewal this quarter, 40,000 square feet at a rent of $4.90 a square foot, 15% greater than our projected underwriting in 2011 when we purchased the asset.","Our second quarter New York City activity was very strong. The pickup in demand was from high-end small tenants, and that's what we described when we talked to you last quarter. We signed 3 full leases at 510 Madison Avenue, so that brings us to about 70% leased. We did 7 deals at 540, 2 at 601 Lex and 2 at the General Motors Building, including a full floor deal at the base of the building. In total, we signed a 152,000 square feet during the quarter and another 56,000 during the first few weeks of July. Our predominant user and our target audience for these buildings, at 510 Madison and 540 Madison and 767 Fifth, are the small hedge fund asset managers and advisors and those types of entities that are not impacted by the densification that I described earlier.","Our pricing at 540 Madison is from the mid-to-low 70s to as high as $100 a square foot. Pricing at 510 Madison is from the low 90s to the mid-130s, and our pricing at the General Motors Building is from the low 90s at the base to the upper 190s at the top of the building. The tenant activity for this segment of the market continues to be very encouraging.","Now large leasing activity also picked up during the second quarter, and it surpassed the typical quarterly volumes in Manhattan, although much of that demand was from renewals and future relocations to the Hudson yards. We continue to see the densification from the large tenants. So as leases expire, those institutions that are moving are likely shedding space. The universe of large lease expirations, which we call -- we sort of characterize as above 200,000 square feet, 250,000-plus, is really limited in 2013 to 2015, and we saw this last quarter Simpson Thacher do a renewal at 425 Park, which has a lease that expires in 2018.","When we discussed 250 West 55th Street with you last quarter, we described that we were starting to show space, but we haven't really gotten involved in exchanging proposals. Well, that has changed. We now have a number of multi-floor prospects that are considering the building with multiple tours, and we have begun to respond to written proposals. Potential users include law firms, financial service firms, fashion firm, media firm and education. We are very busy showing space at 250 West 55th Street.","At the building this quarter, one of our existing law firms took an additional 13,000 square feet and we're out to lease on our second retail transaction.","In D.C., the sequestration, which people really aren't writing about, is still very much a factor. And while it may not be on the front page, it creates an overlay of uncertainty, particularly in the district itself. The absence of incremental demand from the GSA and changes in space utilization in the legal industry, in particular, and the lack of any significant new demand generators that we do, in fact, see in places like Boston and San Francisco and New York, are creating additional headwinds that the district is simply facing today. Second-generation space is plentiful and, at some cases, landlords have expanded tenant approving packages to encourage tenants to relocate. Nonetheless, tenants are going to migrate to newer and more efficient buildings in the CBD, which is our sweet spot.","Even in spite of the softness, there is continued interest in D.C. from investors. 555 12th Street is rumored to be trading for well over $700 a square foot and a major tenant is moving to our building at 601 Mass Avenue in 2015. So if you do the math and you add the transaction cost and the capital improvements that are likely to pass through in the building and operating expense carry, and you net off the existing income between now and '15, the basis for that building is going to be well in excess of $800 a square foot. And there's no active tenant looking at this space. The good news is our D.C. portfolio is 96% leased and Ray and his team in Washington, D.C. get way out in front of lease expirations.","We're currently negotiating 2 major leases in Reston Town Center involving all of our existing vacancy and our 2014 lease expirations. Each of the tenants is in a defense industry and they are making long-term lease commitments, which is a good sign given where we are with sequestration. This quarter, we completed a 95,000 square foot extension with Microsoft at Discovery Square. We continue to achieve rents in the mid- to high 40s, approaching $50 a square foot in the urban core.","At Carnegie Center, we continue to gain both occupancy and extend leases. During the quarter, we completed 3 expansions for about 12,000 square feet and, since July 1, we signed 8 more leases for 285,000 square feet and we're in discussions with 2 growing tenants for deals that total another 200,000 square feet and include almost 100,000 square feet of expansion. In June 2011, when we took the property off of the market, we were 78% leased and we had 700,000 square feet of 2014 lease expirations. Today, we sit at almost 90% committed with 200,000 square feet of 2014 lease expirations. Life sciences is clearly the sector that is at the core of the expansion of Carnegie Center.","I'll finish my remarks with just a little color on our second generation statistics.","In Boston, the transactions are almost exclusively in the suburbs and the net rent went from about $24.28 to $23.15 so very modest change, but it was down slightly. In New York City, the very small decline included only 53,000 square feet and the main negative was a full floor we leased at 399 Park where the new rent was $97.50 and the expiring rent was just over $103. Princeton included 1 9,000 square foot early renewal and had no capital cost associated with it. And in San Francisco, 1\/3 of the deals were retail transactions, and without them, net rents would have been up about 6%. Finally, in D.C., more than 50% of the leasing involve GSA renewals which were effectively flat and very modest increases. And if you exclude those deals, D.C. would have been up 8% on a net basis, largely due to the Northern Virginia portfolio, Reston Town Center.","With that, I'll stop and I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great, thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Happy birthday. No better way to spend your birthday than on a conference call.","I will cover some of the capital markets and projections. We had a very, very busy quarter, at least on our release in the capital markets. Doug talked a little bit about the acquisition, disposition activity. We also refinanced 2 mortgages on joint venture assets, completing a 10-year $105 million financing on 500 North Capitol Street at a fixed rate of 4.15%, and we did a 5-year $120 million bank loan on 540 Madison Avenue that was priced at LIBOR for 150 basis points.","As we discussed on our call last quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured notes in early April. And given the evidence of the acceleration of rising rates, we made a tactical decision to enter the market in late June and raise an additional $700 million of 10.5 year on senior bonds at an all-in yield of 3.92%, effectively prefunding our 2014 debt maturities. We had originally projected to complete this financing in early 2014. But given the enhanced volatility in the markets, we decided to complete the deal early.","We also redeemed $450 million of our exchangeable notes. In connection with the redemption, we paid the principal in cash and we issued approximately 420,000 shares of stock to pay the premium, as our stock price exceeded the exchange strike price in the security. A significant portion of these shares were already included in our diluted share count last quarter, so the change in our share count is only about 182,000 shares.","The credit markets have been extremely volatile over the last couple of months, with the 10-year treasury climbing from a low of 1.63% in early May up to 2.17% when we did our deal in June, and now, at 2.68% today. In connection with the rate moves, our credit spreads also capped out by over 40 basis points before settling back in a little bit today in the mid-140s. Despite the volatility, the markets are open and we believe we could issue 10-year bonds today at an all-in yield of approximately 4.25%.","Borrowing rates -- borrowing costs in the mortgage markets have also increased, with 10-year mortgages available at reasonable leverage in the mid-to-upper 4% range. And the CMBS market also continues to originate deals, despite the spread widening that we saw in June.","If you look at our refinancing exposure, it's pretty low in the next couple of years. We have $747 million of exchangeable notes expiring in February. That was the driver behind our recent debt issue, and we expect to pay it off with cash. The exchange strike price to us on the notes is $134.38 per share. Other than that, we only have 2 small mortgages totaling $72 million expiring through the end of 2014.","Our cash balance of $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter is more than sufficient to fund our $820 million in debt maturity and $600 million in planned development spend through the end of 2014. In addition, we expect to generate proceeds from the asset sales that Doug mentioned.","We also just increased and extended our line of credit to $1 billion and it now expires out in 2018. We achieved a reduction of our all-in pricing of about 30 basis points.","So turning to our second quarter earnings. For the quarter, we reported diluted funds from operations at $1.28 per share, which is $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance or approximately $3 million. About half of the outperformance was in the portfolio, due primarily the lower-than-projected operating expenses. We expect to incur most of these expenses later in the year, so the difference here is really timing. The portfolio performance would have been higher but we did have $0.02 per share of negative variances from lower-than-expected termination income and higher accrued rent reserve this quarter.","The other variant was in our fee income, which was better than projected from stronger tenant service income across the portfolio and leasing fees from a couple of deals at the GM Building. We also reported $428 million of gains related to the sale of 125 West 55th Street and the consolidation of the General Motors Building and Mountain View Research and Technology Parks. The gains are reflected in our net earnings for the quarter but they are not part of funds from operation.","So before I go into the projections, I do want to touch on the impact to our financial statements of the consolidation of the General Motors Building.","As we mentioned last quarter, in connection with the transfer of our partners' 40% interest, we negotiated enhanced decision-making rights that require us to consolidate this previously unconsolidated joint venture. This change will have no impact on our cash earnings and it has a very slight positive impact on our funds from operation.","We've included in our earnings release a chart summarizing the changes of how we project the building will be reported in our income statement and the impact on our FFO for the second half of 2013. We're happy to review this schedule after the call, so if you have specific questions, we would appreciate holding your questions. In a nutshell, we've re-straight-lined and concluded a new fair value lease assessment of the leases that reduces the property's noncash rental revenue, but this is more than offset by a decrease in the property's interest expense from a noncash adjustment to fair value debt, based on market interest rates.","We will also report as additional interest expense our partners' share of interest expense on a partner loan that is part of the original deal structure, but it is completely eliminated in the noncontrolling interest in property partnerships line of our income statement. So on a net basis, the change in the property's contribution to our FFO is slightly better than the prior accounting, with all of these changes being noncash.","The geographic changes in our income statement are sizable, as the property's operations come out of net income from joint ventures and is included within our rental revenue, our operating expenses, interest expense, and noncontrolling interest. Again, netting to a nominal change. We have a similar impact in our balance sheet, you see, with a large reduction in investments from joint ventures and an increase that is marked up to the higher fair value based upon the sales price and our real estate asset, our mortgage debt and our noncontrolling interest and property partnerships.","So turning to our projections. As we look at our projections for 2013, there's really 3 significant changes from our guidance last quarter. The first is the impact of the $700 million bond issuance that we closed at the end of June that was not in our budget. This adds $14 million to our interest expense projection for the year. The second is a decline of $4 million in our capitalized interest projection due to a drop in our average corporate borrowing rate. And the third is the sale of 1301 New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. We project closing in mid-August and the FFO loss is approximately $3 million. These capital items, net of the associated higher interest income of about $1 million, will reduce our 2013 FFO by approximately $0.12 per share.","In the portfolio, we improved our occupancy, as Owen mentioned, by 40 basis points to 92.1%. We continue to anticipate further positive absorption, averaging between 92% and 93% over the second half of 2013. And as Doug detailed, we're seeing better activity in many of our buildings where we have some vacancy. These include 510 and 540 Madison Avenue in New York City and Bay Colony in Waltham. At this point in the year, the conversion of this activity to signed leases will actually be more impactful to 2014 and we're not projecting significant incremental income in 2013.","We expect our same-store portfolio NOI to be up 2% to 3% over 2012 on a GAAP basis and 5% to 6% over 2012 on a cash basis. Our same-store projections are in line with last quarter on a GAAP basis, but they are 50 basis points lower on a cash basis. The drop in our cash NOI is related to 2 transactions: one, an early renewal of a 95,000 square foot tenant in Reston; and the other, a 55,000 square foot expansion by a suburban Boston tenant, both with modest free rent concessions that are starting in 2013.","It is basically a swap in our projections between cash and straight-line rents of about $4 million this year. Both of these are positive transactions for the portfolio, but they reduce our cash NOI projection in the short term.","Our noncash, straight line and fair value rents are projected to be $87 million to $92 million for the full year. This includes $22 million from the General Motors Building, consolidated, and is otherwise higher than the last quarter's projection, primarily about a $4 million swap between cash and straight-line rent I mentioned. The contribution to the funds from operation of our joint ventures is lower by $48 million, mainly due to the consolidation of the GM Building, which is now reflected only-owned portfolio and we're projecting full year FFO contribution from joint ventures to be $63 million to $68 million.","Our hotel property, located in Cambridge, missed its budget for the second quarter by $700,000. We've made a corresponding reduction to our full year guidance and now project it to contribute NOI between $9.5 million and $10.5 million for the year.","In our development and management services income for 2013, we project $27 million to $30 million. The projection is slightly lower than last quarter, with the better-than-projected performance in the second quarter offset by a change in the accounting for the management fee at the GM Building. As a result of consolidation, the management fees for the GM Building, which approximate about $5 million a year, will not be recognized as fee income. Instead, our partners' 40% share will be reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interest in property partnerships. We still recognize the same amount of FFO but the geography will change.","Our G&A projection for 2013 is unchanged from last quarter, and we continue to expect G&A expense of between $106 million and $108 million for the year.","Our reported interest expense will be higher, going forward, from the consolidated -- consolidation of the GM Building. This interest expense was previously recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures, and we will now be reporting interest expense on the $1.6 billion of GM third-party loans at fair value, which totals $31.5 million for 2013.","Another impact that I mentioned a minute ago was the inclusion of the interest on our partner's loan. The partner loan interest totaled $16.6 million for the 7-month consolidation period in 2013. And as I mentioned earlier, it's fully reversed out in noncontrolling interest. The impact of our $700 million recent bond issuance was not in our prior projection. It increases our interest expense by $14 million in 2013. And lastly, our capitalized interest projection is lower by $4 million due to a reduction in our corporate borrowing rate.","The changes this quarter to our interest expense including the refinancing of $450 million of exchangeable notes that had a 6% GAAP rate, with newly issued bonds at 3.2% and the inclusion of the GM building debt at its fair value of 3%, reduces our average corporate borrowing rate and, correspondingly, our interest capitalization rate by about 50 basis points. All of these changes aggregate to increase our interest expense projection by $66 million for 2013. $48 million of the increase is associated with GM geography. Inclusive of the benefit of slightly higher interest income, we project net interest expense to be between $438 million to $441 million for 2013, with capitalized interest projected to be $66 million to $70 million.","The last variance, which also relates to the reporting for the GM Building is an increase in allocation of income to our noncontrolling interest and property partnerships that reduces our FFO by $16 million from our prior projection. So if you combine all of these projections, it results in a revised guidance range for 2013 funds from operation of $4.89 to $4.94 per share. After adjusting for the impact of the latest bond issuance, the sale of 1301 New York Avenue and lower capitalized interest reducing our FFO by $0.12 per share, our new range reflects an increase from projected improvement in our operations of approximately $0.02 per share at the midpoint of our range. Our projections do not include the potential impact of a sale of all or part of Times Square -- Times Square Tower or any additional acquisition, disposition or financing activities.","For the third quarter, we project funds from operation of $1.27 to $1.29 per share. For 2014 -- we're not going to provide specific guidance on this call for 2014. We will talk about it next quarter. But there were a couple of items that I did want to note that I think are worth mentioning.","First, we expect another strong year in 2014 of cash NOI growth. We have a number of leases with a large amount of free rent burning off, which includes tenants at the Hancock Tower, Atlantic Wharf, Cambridge Center, 399 Park Avenue, 601 Lex, 510 Madison Avenue and Patriots Park which, alone, total $52 million of incremental cash NOI -- of incremental cash revenue.","Second, we have already raised the debt necessary to refinance our 2014 debt maturities. So the repayment of the $747 million of exchangeable notes due in February that carries a GAAP interest rate of 6.56% and a cash interest rate of 3 5\/8% is expected to result in a reduction of our interest expense run rate. And we also project a reduction in our G&A expense in 2014, as much of the nonrecurring expenses associated with our management changes will be complete.","That finishes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, Doug, going back to some of your commentary where you are saying that markets are getting better but you are concerned about new supply. Can you talk about how you think this plays out over the next couple of years in your largest markets of New York, Boston and San Francisco?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. So I think that, largely, the expectation that we have is that the growth from tenants that are in the nontraditional office use category, [indiscernible], are going to expand enough to absorb a portion of the supply that is being left over by tenants that are moving into new buildings, and a portion of that supply is also going to become -- B-ish quality or lower quality in its nature and it's going to be less attractive to tenants that are trying to become more efficient. And so, over time, you'll actually see an improvement in the economics that we're going to see in those marketplaces but it's not going to be the same kind of spike that you have in rents that we saw, call it, in 2005 to 2007, because there just is this torrent of cost compression that is out there that's just sort of pushing a governor on it on the other direction.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, as you're thinking about that, I mean the market concern is that interest rates are rising, cap rates probably go up. But for the higher-quality assets, there's an expectation that NOI and rent will increase commensurate with that, or hopefully will. How are you guys thinking about that as you're underwriting assets and as you're just thinking about valuations in general?","Douglas T. Linde","A couple of things. The first is that, if we really do have significant interest rate expansion and we have inflation that's associated with that, it's not just sort of a technical change in interest rates, the cost of construction is going to go through the roof. And we're seeing a little bit of that right now in some of the markets because, during the last portion of the recession, there was a tremendous amount of capacity on the construction side in terms of companies that were actually out there doing the work, particularly on the subs, that are just gone. They just -- they evaporated. They weren't making any money, so they went away. So there is some cost escalation, but it's manageable right now. So if it actually takes off, then you're going to see the pricing required to build new buildings go up significantly. And, honestly, that gives us a huge runway and an ability to raise our rents. And that's a good thing if that happens. With regards to pricing expectations, I think it's fair to say that, where we are today in terms of CBD buildings, and Owen described it as atypical, the expected return that investors are looking at today, based upon where current interest rates are, is not something that we presume is going to be sustainable. If the average 10-year treasury is at 5% and there is inflation expectation, it's much harder to think that you're -- that people are going to be buying CBD buildings at 3% or 4% cap rates, which hopefully gives us more opportunity, as Mort suggested, to be much more acquisitive. Today, we're not there, but hopefully, we'll be in the future.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to Mike LaBelle, can you talk about how you're thinking about investment firepower today. I know you said you've pre-funded your 2014 debt maturities. But how should we think about what you have now to spend on incremental investment?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, I think part of it depends on the sales activity and what that creates for us. We've got more than sufficient liquidity to deal with our debt maturities and our pipeline that we have. If you look even further out, our debt maturities even further out are also significantly lower. So if you solely look at those things, our need to raise additional debt next year is limited. But obviously, a lot of things can change. Because there could be a lot of other investment opportunities that pop up or development opportunities that we pursue that increase our need to raise capital to fund those opportunities. So it really depends on how that plays out.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just finally, do you know what your GAAP leasing spreads were for the quarter?","Michael E. LaBelle","No. I mean, I don't have it offhand. We can go back and look and give you a call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to just look at development for a second here. Doug, you mentioned that you're cautiously optimistic, I heard, in your prepared remarks, about conditions in the markets. And I was curious, if that -- how that will translate into new development and potential additions to the pipeline. Could we expect, or should we expect, some more speculative development to come online? And sort of what kind of pace would you envision over the next sort of 12 to 18 months?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that, given where our current pipeline is in San Francisco right now, where we do have some speculative development underway, I would say that, that is probably the primary area that you might see speculative development in the short term, i.e., there's probably not a lot of speculative development that you're going to see. We have a site in Boston in the suburbs that we have made a significant number of proposals on, where the tenants will be taking somewhere between 60% and 70% of the building. So there will be a speculative component. The building at 888 Boylston Street has had some tenant interest, and some of the tenants who have taken -- have been interested in the whole thing and some of the tenants have been interested in 40% or 50% of it. So there's potentially a speculative component associated with that. Outside of those 2 projects, the other things that we're looking at are the land that we have in greater Washington D.C. I think we would anticipate having a significant pre-leasing associated with it. And then we actually do have a build-to-suit that's in the works in Princeton, at Carnegie Center. Again, it would be almost 100%, if not 100%, leased if we started construction there. And then in Midtown Manhattan, at the moment, we're really not in a position to have additional sites that are anywhere close to being ready for construction.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the dispositions on the opposite side, I mean, Mike, what are you sort of budgeting in terms of cash? It sounds like you're going to pay off the $750 million or so with cash in '14 but you're assuming, essentially, maintaining this cash, just a gradual spend down. And what happens to the extent that some of these other assets that you have up for sale start to hit?","Michael E. LaBelle","Let me answer the question in the following way, which is I think Mort sort of indicated that having available cash is a strategic advantage, assuming that there are opportunities to purchase things. And if that set of circumstances occur, we'll be in a position to do that. We have not tried to line up the sale of our assets with that specific cash need that we have. I think we're being much more opportunistic about the sale of the buildings and the fact that, as Owen's described, we're in a very unusual period vis-\u00e0-vis where operating fundamentals are and where interest rates, and therefore, valuations are. So we're taking advantage of what we think is a very optimal time to sell assets without a clear place that we sort of are pointing to towards where those dollars are going. We would hope that we will find development opportunities within our markets where we can deploy that money in 2013 and 2014, in addition to what we currently have in our pipeline. But that's a -- it's a little bit of a nebulous answer because I don't think we have a clear indication of where the money is going to go to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","All the discussion I heard earlier was sort of indicating that you guys are pretty comfortable to potentially kind of thinking about this as a bottom in the market, relative to both low cost of debt and where you're seeing cap rates on stabilized CBD assets. If you think we're an upswing in one direction or another with either of those variables, does this begin to force up your yield hurdles on some of the developments that you're thinking about that are in the pipeline? Is there sort of a lockstep movement in those expectations as well?","Owen D. Thomas","It's Owen. Yes, I think that, over time, as interest rates increase, the returns that we would expect from developments should have some incremental increase over time. That being said, I think if interest rates go up it's going to be because the economy is improving and, therefore, demand for real estate will go up and rents will go up. So there would likely be some offset in terms of rental increase. But, yes, I think required returns will go up.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And then sort of along the same lines, you speak about selling mature assets with compressed cap rates a little bit more aggressively into this market. What are your thoughts around some of the weaker assets, potentially in this market? In particular, some of the New Jersey suburban assets?","Owen D. Thomas","So I would, I guess, beg to differ with you that they're weak. What we've seen, from an activity perspective in Princeton has been probably second to what we've seen in suburban Boston, the most active part of our portfolio in the last, call it, 3 to 4 months. And there are, again, similar types of companies that are growing in that portion of New Jersey that are similar to the types of companies that are growing in San Francisco, but more importantly, in greater suburban Boston. So I beg to differ it was a weakness. I think we've made it clear that, at the right time, with the right pricing, the Carnegie Center is an asset that we will consider disposing of. And we'll revisit as we continue to have even higher occupancy and we have more tenants that are looking for space and we have less and less lease expiration.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is just, and maybe I missed it. Did you guys comment on joint venture partner activity on Transbay? Are there any ongoing discussions or new discussions taking place there?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, as Doug described, we're in the process of bringing the asset to grade and we are, obviously, marketing the building to prospective tenants and we are considering our capital structure for the property. We certainly have made no decisions with respect to how we're going to ultimately capitalize the project. But bringing in a joint venture partner is something that we will consider over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm not sure if this question is best answered by Mort, Owen or Doug. I know you're all on the board. But can you sort of just discuss, after sort of the nonbinding say-on-pay, which only got 19% approval from shareholders, I guess, how is management, how is the board sort of reacting to that? Will there be any changes or you sort of just stick with the agreement that's already been signed?","Owen D. Thomas","This is Owen. The board has certainly taken note of the say-on-pay vote, and it's been having conversation with us and among themselves. And I do think we'll be reaching out to shareholders in the coming months.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","To get their views and potential changes down the road?","Owen D. Thomas","To get their views, yes, and in response to the say-on-pay vote.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just on asset sales, in addition to Times Square Tower, what other assets are on the market? Have you sort of put others as you sort of evaluate the marketplace? Just for us to get a sense of total volume.","Douglas T. Linde","I think that, Michael, for calendar 2013, we had been marketing 140 Kendrick Street, and the pricing that we got on 140 Kendrick Street was really not, quite frankly, up to what we expected we would need to sell the asset. And so I'd say we sort of pulled back on that particular asset, and that was about a $130-plus million building. We are about to hit the market with another few assets. We haven't \"made a formal decision\" yet, but we're talking about on a magnitude of $250 million, plus or minus, that unlikely would close in 2013, probably closer to 2014. And Owen, I think rightly so, every time he comes to Boston and when he goes to the other regions, is saying, \"So what should we be thinking about putting on the market potentially in 2014, if things are in a similar environment as we are today?\" And so I'd say the regions are thinking long and hard about what their views are on what assets are mature or not and don't have enough growth left in them to keep in the portfolio. And that's sort of an ongoing conversation.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So from a cash perspective, once you include 1301 and these $250 million of sales, call it $400 million, and then Times Square Tower, which obviously, from a size perspective, would dwarf that significantly, that's what we should be thinking about in terms of capital raising?","Owen D. Thomas","I think that's what you should think about for capital raising over the next, call it, 6-plus months.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the tax basis just on Times Square Tower, the undepreciated book is 630. Is that approximately what sort of tax basis is as we think about potential sale and tax and gain and things like that?","Owen D. Thomas","Yes. I think you got the 630 from our K, I assume, and that's a pretty good approximation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Most of my questions have been answered. But just wanted to ask about the residential side of the business. You guys have 1 under -- still under construction, 2 operating properties. What's been the experience? And with that, how good are you feeling about being in the residential business? And as you look for additional development opportunities, are you likely to have some residential component going forward?","Douglas T. Linde","So I'll answer the question as follows. So what we've said previously is that we think we have the competency and the skill set to design, develop and construct in-fill residential properties in the markets that we are operating in. And as a developer, we think we can make a lot of money building in those types of places, largely due to the similar characteristics on the office side, which is this is where people want to live because this is where the companies that are growing and that are attracting labor want their people to be. So there is sort of a confluence of strategies implicit in both sides of that. We recognize fully that we do not have either the competency at the moment or the portfolio size to be a great operator of residential properties. And so we recognize that we have to hire people who have that competency, and it costs us something to do that. I think that we also have a perspective that they're not core long-term holds for us, necessarily, but they could be. So to the extent that we've created a lot of value, if we're developing a residential property in an in-fill location to a 7-plus percent cash-on-cash return and it's worth 3.5% or 4% cash-on-cash return, as Owen -- well, as he goes around to the regions, we'll say, \"Is that the kind of asset that we should monetize potentially?\" And based upon Safe Harbor and the 2 years and all the other sort of things, those are the types of things we're thinking about. So I think that in all of our regions, we have sort of put it on the table that our regional teams should be thinking about locations where we can potentially productively put capital to work and put our expertise to work on the residential side.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, what's the internal feeling on special dividends? I mean, is it just a necessary evil? Is it something that you're ambivalent about doing? Is it something that you'd rather not, if you can find some way of avoiding it?","Douglas T. Linde","The short answer is, is that we think that our shareholders value cash no differently than they value, in terms of special dividend, an appreciation in the stock price. And so to the extent that we have a special dividend, we don't look at it as a sort of necessary evil, if that's what you're asking. So one concern that we would have is we want to make sure that we're doing this in an appropriate manner in that we want to maybe able to maintain the earnings power to pay out our existing dividend on a consistent basis. And we also don't want to use the payment of special dividends as a way to leverage up the company because we don't think that would be an appropriate capital strategy. So those are sort of the 2 governors that we think about with regards to special dividend.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Let me just say -- this is Mort speaking. I do want to add just 1 other comment with respect to the possibility to be involved in the residential side of the real estate business. As you know, we've done occasional projects in the residential area, and frankly, we've had a good experience with them. And we feel that it gives us another arrow in our quiver to work with in the real estate business. And so we will continue to look for opportunities on the residential side, providing they meet the standards that we hope for in terms of both scale and quality and long-term appreciation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Mort, since you're still -- since you're on the line there, just the first question is for you. Obviously, a lot of discussion with the Fed replacement potential. You had your editorial last week. Just sort of curious. One, why do you think that the President hasn't let Ben Bernanke determine his future? And two, are you ambivalent whether it's Yellen or Summers? I mean, it seems -- given the impact that the Fed is going to have on interest rates, which obviously impacts the value of your office buildings, just sort of curious if it makes a difference whoever replaces him.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I think it often does make a difference. I think the fact that Ben Bernanke was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve at this particular time was almost a gift because he had had all of the great experiences and academic and understanding of what happened during the Great Depression. He was a great authority on what happened during the Great Depression, and he understood how critical it was that we keep the financial system well-lubricated. And he did more than almost anybody else in the world, in fact, not almost than anybody else in the world. In fact, he was a leader in trying to get other countries to open their particular financial channels as well. But the end result of it was then instead of getting a financial system that could have gotten completely clogged, we ended up with a financial world that remained open, and the banks did not fail. And the -- what should I call it, the economy did not suffer from a huge contraction of the availability of credit, which, frankly, when there was those few moments of panic in the world back in 2008 and 2009, could very well have been one of the outcomes. So I have the greatest of respect for him. My concern about the way he was handled, as I try to indicate, was that he should have been given the chance to announce his own departure in a slightly more dignified way, given the extraordinary contribution he made. And I thought it was really unbecoming of the way to treat somebody who had made such a major contribution to the economy and to the financial system of the United States and, indeed, to -- in fact, since he led a lot of other countries and influenced a lot of the countries and just helped the global economy to function properly. So I felt that, that was just not the way to deal with somebody who had made such a remarkable contribution to the United States, to its economy and to our ability to go forward without having a major crash. So I think as far as who is going to succeed Bernanke, I think both Summers and Yellen are outstanding economists and banking figures. And I think as we know in the way the system works, this going to be the judgment of the President and not the judgment of commentators, particularly who comment in the media. So I'll just wait and see how it goes. I know them both for a long period of time. I particularly know Larry Summers for probably 30-odd years, since I was on the faculty at Harvard when he was the President of Harvard University. So we go back a long way. But I think they are both extremely talented people, and you've seen a lot of commentary on both of them. And I suspect that whoever gets the designation, assuming it's one of the two, will again try and respond not to their particular ideologies but to the facts on the ground. And those facts on the ground, as you probably have seen from just the most recent descriptions of the level of GDP growth, which is now estimated, according to a series put forth by The Wall Street Journal when they interviewed a number of economists, seems to be on a decline. So I don't think we're in a period of time where there's going to be any serious tightening of the financial conditions that are going to be available to companies who want to invest money. But we're in an unprecedented period and, therefore, in an unpredictable period, and we'll just all have to wait and see how it plays out. But I suspect -- not that I suspect, I'm sure that the Federal Reserve will continue to pay -- play the kind of role that Bernanke paved for his successors, including allowing Federal Reserve not only to buy short-term paper to help the liquidity of the financial system and to keep the short-term rates down but to continue to buy long-term paper. This is sort of another version of QE3 or it will be QE4. Secondly, I do think that the federal government, the Federal Reserve, in fact, will no longer just be a policymaker, but they will be an active participant in the capital markets in order to make sure that their goals in terms of interest rates and capital availability will be met because they don't want the economy to get any weaker than it is now. And so far, despite this huge deficit spending on the part of the federal government and huge monetary stimulus on the part of the Federal Reserve, we still have not had a general economy that has moved up to the levels of growth that we are accustomed to. In fact, as I mentioned before, in the survey, a lot of economists feel that we might even be at a growth rate for this quarter that will be less than 1%. We'll all have to see because nobody can predict these things for certain. But it's certainly something that we watch very carefully because it affects our views on the capital markets, our views on the sale of properties, our views on the investments that we did. I would point out that in the year 2006, when we had the same apprehension about the condition of the economy, we engaged in a number of sales at very, very attractive prices, which enabled us to, shall we say, rebuild our portfolio with assets like the General Motors Building and the John Hancock Building in Boston because we had the financial resources to go ahead and do that. That's one of the reasons why we went out into the capital markets this year. I think we want to put ourselves into position to take advantage of any opportunities that might become available. And under almost all circumstances, such opportunities will become available. That's my commentary. Thank you.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Which dovetails into my second question. Doug, NAREIT, we spoke about -- or you guys spoke about the potential of maybe expanding beyond core Midtown to look at acquisition or investment opportunities in some of the neighborhoods where some of the new -- where employees of the new tech companies want to position. Are you guys thinking about just sort of traditional Boston-type buildings? Or would you look at older-type buildings that would involve some renovation or possibly development sites?","Owen D. Thomas","It's Owen. To answer your question, we are considering, as we discussed at NAREIT, looking at some of the emerging\/emerged neighborhoods in Manhattan where there is significant tenant demand growth and rent growth. We will continue to focus on quality. A core to our strategy that Mort has reiterated over and over again, and Doug, is having A-quality building, and that will continue to be our focus. Exactly how that's defined is to be determined, but we will be focusing on maintaining a high-quality portfolio of buildings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just update us on your thinking on what amount of pre-leased square footage you'd like to have before deciding to move beyond grade in the fourth quarter of '14. Is it in the neighborhood of several hundred thousand square feet? And would having a JV partner, if you chose to go that route, would that potentially reduce the threshold?","Douglas T. Linde","You're not going to like the answer that I'm going to give you because it's not going to -- you're not going to find it satisfying, but I'm going to give it to you, anyway, which is it depends. So as an example, if the market in San Francisco were -- a year from now, we're trading in a level where space at the Embarcadero Center and space at Foundry Square were all leased and there was a much lower vacancy factor and there was significant expansion of existing tenants and new technology tenants that are continuing to come into the city, I think our threshold for how much square footage of leasing we would need to start on the Transbay would be lower. If it were similar to a situation like it is right now where things are good, things are strong, things are, I would say, healthy, there is a modest amount of growth going on in the city, I think the number is going to be significantly higher than that. And the good news is that we don't have to make that decision right now. If we had a joint venture partner, clearly, the risk that each partner is taking is significantly reduced, and, clearly, that would be a factor as well in the decision that we would make.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's very fair. And on 601 Mass Ave and perhaps using that as a barometer of D.C. strength, in general, is 79% pre-leased about where you expected to be at this point? Is it better or worse than you would have hoped? And how much higher would you like to see that figure upon completion?","Douglas T. Linde","So all of the remaining space at 601 Mass Avenue is stuck in neutral at the moment because the existing pre-leased commitment to Arnold & Porter effectively put us in a situation where we had to hold all their remaining space off the market until October, I think, right, of 2013. So we've been in no position to be -- even be able to offer the space to the market. So it is exactly where we would have expected it to be.","Raymond A. Ritchey","I guess, Doug, we can always be 21% better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Hey, Ray, a lot happening in Washington, D.C.. Got the Silver Line finishing soon. You've got the hot lanes open in Northern Virginia. The Freeze the Footprint seems to be really on its -- here to stay. National Science Foundation did a build-to-suit in sort of a secondary Metro location. Fish and Wildlife seems to be maybe getting done over in Skyline. Can you sort of, without pumping your own submarket concentration, give an arbitrary or an honest assessment of how all these changes will affect the leasing velocity in various submarkets?","Raymond A. Ritchey","That's a pretty open-ended question, John. And you know me, I can never stop pumping our own products in our own markets. But I do think the fundamental change we've seen with the Silver Line is that what used to be the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor in Arlington is now the Rosslyn out to Tysons corridor. And those Defense users that may look to go inside the Beltway will now certainly consider Tysons as a secondary location and, eventually, hopefully, Reston. But, again, to go to the bottom line, I'm not going to critique other REITs markets. But I just really like our position in Reston Town Center. As Doug detailed, we are effectively 99% leased out there. The highest net effective rents probably in the city of Washington, D.C. and virtually no new supply forthcoming. So without, again, casting negative views towards the other options, we continue to like our position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Question on just development mindset. You have a large pipeline already, but you are seemingly somewhat bearish on real estate value since you're selling assets and not finding value in acquisitions. So just curious if your appetite for additional development is somewhat muted. Or is it just -- are you willing to add new projects if the pre-leasing hits your targets?","Douglas T. Linde","So I guess I'll take exception to saying that we're bearish on valuations because we're selling and not buying. I think what we've identified is a situation where there are assets where the growth profile, from our perspective, is less than what the growth profile or value might be from a third-party owner's perspective. And so we think there's a great opportunity to both enhance the overall growth rate of the company going forward and raise a lot of cash at the same time. So I think that's why we're selling assets, not because we think they're overvalued and on the decline. With regards to development, I think we believe that we can get significantly enhanced yields on development, particularly in the markets where we have sites and access to sites, over and above where we could otherwise deploy that money into existing assets. And existing assets obviously have the hindrance of having leases in place. And to the extent those leases in place lock in the returns for an extended period of time and we can achieve returns that are significantly higher than that, then we think, incrementally, we're better off putting our capital into development. That's not to say that we're not prepared to -- if we have the right opportunity on the acquisition side and it's got the right lease profile and we're comfortable with where we think either we can reposition the asset or how we can implement change to the asset and, therefore, drive enhanced yields in terms of where current rents are or we like the leasing exposure, that we wouldn't jump into that. I mean, there's a building, for example, in the New York metropolitan area that we're looking at, where there's good rollover in 2016 and we like where the asset happens to be positioned. And if we can figure out a way to purchase the asset from the existing owner, I think it would be a great acquisition opportunity, largely because of where it's located. So we're not -- it's not we're either on or off with regards to acquisitions and dispositions. We're smart enough, we think, to be open to looking at lots of different ways to recycle and invest capital through good and bad markets.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Earlier in the call, when you expressed some hope of maybe in the future being able to buy again when the 10-year was at 5% and there were higher inflation expectations built into fixed income pricing, that was not necessarily your expectation but just sort of a hopeful commentary down the road?","Douglas T. Linde","Yes.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the commentary on leasing activity at 250 West 55th seemed like one of the more positive things that I heard on the call so far. I'm just curious, did it just sort of -- did a light switch go off? Or what was sort of the impetus for the market finally seeming to come your way on that building a little bit more? At least it sounds like. And then just curious if you have a stabilization timeline for that building.","Douglas T. Linde","I'll answer the last question first, which is I don't think we yet have a stabilization time frame. We are hoping that we will do enough leasing in 2013 and 2014, so that by the time Kaye Scholer starts paying rent, which is I think in 2015, we will be stabilized. I mean, that's our hope. I mean, I want to say it's sooner than that, but that's where our sort of expectations are right now. In terms of why things are better in terms of the level of activity, I would say that as we got to the point where the building was ready to be opened and it was an easy tour for a broker to bring someone to the building and they could see a working lobby and they could get into a passenger elevator as opposed to a hoist and the floors were clean and ready and we started having broker open houses and basically pushing the pavement in terms of getting the word out that the space was available and you could start construction on it, it sort of naturally became, I think, more real to the marketplace. And I -- but I can't tell you why in the last 3.5 months, Owen or Mort or Robert has toured the space with a prospective tenant at a minimum of twice a week. And we've got more than a handful of multi-floor tenants that are actively studying the building with architects and have provided us with request for proposals and, in some cases, given us responses and are encouraged by the -- we are encouraged by the overall level of activity. Now we haven't made any deals yet. So I guess I'm somewhat skeptical of giving you a firm date on when we're going to have a lease because you never know with real estate transactions how long they take and what the path to getting a lease signed is. But we're optimistic that between now and beginning of 2014, we'll have some strong leases signed, and the building will feel even better than it does today.","Robert E. Selsam","This is Robert Selsam. I can add a little bit of color to Doug's answer. Some of the tenants have just recently entered the market. So every tenant has its own time frame. They typically select a broker, and then they do surveys. And then, finally, they get out in the market. And it just happens to be that several of these tenants have just recently entered the market in a serious way.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a little bit more detail around San Francisco. I mean, there's been a lot of news saying Google is expanding within their current location, and some other guys like Kaiser Permanente are likely to do the same thing. Just kind of given all the spec development that's going on in San Francisco, I mean, does that kind of change your view in regards to what yields could look like for new developments, if all these potential new demand people were thinking could show up suddenly is kind of staying put?","Douglas T. Linde","I guess I'm a little unclear as to your -- the question. I'll try and answer what I heard, and you can ask a follow-up. So a lot of the growth that you're describing is down in the Valley. So Google, for example, has taken a significant amount of additional space in the Valley, both from an ownership perspective, as well as from a lease perspective. And they seem to be having an insatiable demand for space. And there are 3 or 4 tenants like that down in the Valley. Google also is rumored to be renewing and expanding in the city of San Francisco, at a building where they're currently located and don't look like they're going to be moving to a new facility. And so there is, in fact, growth both down in the Valley, as well as in the CBD of San Francisco from a tenant like Google. And I think we're seeing consistent growth like that from other tenants that are located in and around the San Francisco area. I mean, it's no secret. People talked about it for quite some time that there is a transportation issue associated with moving people who would want to live in the urban locations in the city of San Francisco down to the Valley. So each of these companies has fleets of buses that are moving people back and forth all day long. And to the extent that they find it palatable to have their people located in the city and can make a rationalization in terms of how those operating groups are working with the employees who are \"off-campus,\" they're doing that. With regards to yields, I'm not entirely sure how those 2 things necessarily come together. Our view on yields right now is based upon sort of where we see overall investment returns and where we see IRRs and where we see interest rates. And I -- and so the demand equation I certainly think would help us in terms of starting more -- with more speculative space. But I don't think it would necessarily help us make a decision with regards to whether we're more or less interested in development.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes. So this is Mort. Let me add one -- can I add one thing to that commentary in San Francisco? We think that the assets that we are in the throes of developing in San Francisco will -- particularly will become the iconic buildings in San Francisco and the preeminent buildings. And we've always found that when those buildings get to be clearer in the vision, the lines of vision of the markets, that we get a very, very strong response. So I think people are, I think, beginning to understand what we are committed to in terms of the quality of design and function of the buildings we're going to be building. And so we think that will spark a lot of interest in this space that we'll be bringing to the market.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Douglas T. Linde","I think that covers everything that we had. Hopefully, everyone will get through the conference call season and enjoy a couple of weeks of August before we get back to having conferences in September. And we'll look forward to seeing you -- each of us will be at different places at different times, so you'll see a smattering of Boston Properties folks as you make the -- do the conference call circuit.

Having said that, I'd like to welcome Mort Zuckerman, Executive Chairman; Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer.","During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. We are, as everybody else is in this wonderful economy of ours, basically operating in a fairly weak economy and a fairly low rate of growth and, particularly, in a fairly weak increase in employment where a large part of the employment comes from part-time work rather than from full-time work.","Having said that, though, the markets that we are in, as you've all known, and we've sort of underscored over and over again, frankly are, if I could put it in popular terms, the top 1% of the markets in New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco. They're the best markets, we believe, of any major cities in the United States. And it shows up in the activities that we are enjoying and working with. In particular, in each one of these markets, we have a range of products and those products, frankly, are meeting with a pretty good response from the marketplace to the extent that there is demand, and in each of these markets, there is demand. It's not a overwhelming demand, but it's a solid demand. The strongest markets are, for example, in San Francisco where they have the location there of the online world. It's probably the headquarters or the leading city for the online world, and they're growing at rates that we have not seen ever in any particular market. But Washington, New York and, indeed, Boston are still -- and Cambridge are still additional markets. In Washington, we, of course, also have a very, very substantial activity in Reston, Virginia. So we have a diversification even within these markets.","Nevertheless, the one advantage that we are, frankly, able to exploit, take advantage of, is the interest rate environment which, as you all know, is almost at record lows over an extended period of time. It's certainly been the longest period of low interest rates that we've had since the end of World War II, and this gives us the chance to finance our activities and finance the company and to be able to refinance our activities when necessary.","So in that sense, the environment for the company is actually pretty good in these markets, pretty good in the financial markets and in the markets that we are in, in the buildings that we are doing, where we are sort of in the upper end of the office market. There are still a lot of activity in there, so we're all feeling pretty good about it. We're kind of a little wary of the progress we've made over the past quarter, the past year. And with the progress that we foresee for the next period of time, as I say, particularly in San Francisco, which will be covered here, it's just been an opportunity for us to do what we do and have done, which is to find good sites, to build good buildings, to lease them well, to manage them well and to hold onto a good number of our clients on a longer-term basis. And to have built up credibility in the marketplace, that does make it easier for us to do all of what I've just described, both in terms of acquisition of sites, of building the buildings, when we're getting the tenants or financing the building.","","So we're in a fairly comfortable place here, I don't want to overstate it, but I also don't want to understate it. With that, if I may, I'll just end my comments and turn it over to Owen.","Owen D. Thomas","Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, and our overall performance for the second quarter and then provide an update on our capital strategy and execution.","Mort covered some details on the environment. I would just reiterate that we believe the U.S. economy continues to experience somewhat sluggish growth characteristics and the economic indicators are mixed. As all of you know, GDP growth in the first quarter was revised down to negative 2.9%. Although the second quarter GDP numbers have came out this morning at 4%, which was certainly above consensus forecast, full year GDP growth is estimated to be 3%, and I think that will probably now be raised as well.","And the payroll numbers in June, at least on their face, were more favorable, and published unemployment's dropping -- has dropped to about 6.1%. Importantly, the impact of this sluggish and uneven growth on our business has not changed substantially from what we reported to you over the last few quarters. Those markets, such as San Francisco, Cambridge and segments of New York City, which are driven by tenants and technology and other creative sectors, are experiencing very favorable growth characteristics in terms of rent increases and net absorption.","However, likewise, those markets that are more reliant on traditional tenants, such as government, financials and law firms, are exhibiting lower levels of activity and growth. For us, those markets would be downtown Washington, D.C. and, to some extent Midtown Manhattan.","Now moving to results for the second quarter for us. We performed well and made considerable progress in the execution of our business. FFO for the second quarter was $1.35 per share, which is $0.02 per share above consensus forecast. There are several recurring and nonrecurring items in the quarterly result, which Mike will cover in his remarks later in the call. Also in the quarter, we completed 88 leases, representing 2.1 million square feet, with the San Francisco and Boston regions being the largest contributors to that result.","The 714,000 square foot lease with Salesforce.com is obviously also a large contributor to our leasing results. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 93% leased, up 60 basis points from 92.4% leased at the end of the first quarter.","And lastly, we also made significant progress executing our development pipeline and our asset monetization plan, which leads to my next topic, which is turning to capital strategy. As Mort referenced, interest rates continue to decline over the last quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped roughly 0.5% or 50 basis points to below 2.5% since year-end. But despite the continued commitment by the Federal Reserve to taper its quantitative leasing program, investor enthusiasm for real estate, particularly in our core markets, remains high. Our capital strategy remains consistent with what we've been communicating to you over the last several quarters. And that is, given pricing levels for assets in our core markets, we continue to find acquisitions challenging. However, we do continue to evaluate new investment opportunities in all our markets for both existing buildings and new development. Currently, we have the acquisition of a single building under a Letter of Intent in Washington, D.C., for under $100 million and are evaluating several additional properties and development sites where we believe Boston Properties has the unique ability to add value and, therefore, compete.","Given low interest rates and attractive pricing for our existing assets, we continue to actively monetize selected assets in our portfolio. We've made significant progress in our disposition activities in the second quarter, having closed 1 deal and placed 4 additional sales under contract, representing $437 million in gross sales proceeds.","Yesterday, we closed the disposition of a portion of our Mountain View single-story product. We received an unsolicited offer and are selling a group of buildings comprising 198,000 square feet for $92 million.","Sale price represents the 5.6% cap rate and $464 per square foot, and we purchased the properties for $290 a square foot. The buildings were initially purchased in 2008, pre-crash, and the sale generated a 23% unleveraged total return to shareholders.","The portfolio is being sold to a user, who is evaluating the acquisition development plan.","Next, we also have under contract for sale, Patriots Park, which is a 705,000 square foot suburban office complex located in Reston, Virginia.","The sale price of $321 million represents a 5.2% cap rate and $455 a square foot, which we think is particularly attractive given the buildings are in a suburban location, outside of Reston's urban core and are leased to the GSA for 20 years with flat rent. This asset was purchased 16 years ago in 1998 and the sale generated 11.5% unleveraged total return to shareholders.","We also have under contract 2 land parcels, settling $24 million in gross sales proceeds. As you know, we also attempted to sell The Avenue, a 335-unit Class A apartment building we built near Washington Circle and downtown Washington, D.C. We have been under contract and engaged with a single buyer for several months. At the present time, the buyer is unable to perform, which has lead us to take the property off the market.","And then, lastly, with respect to asset monetization, we continue to target at least $1 billion in sales this year and are evaluating the possibility of additional asset joint ventures similar to the transaction we completed with Times Square Tower last year.","Lastly, on capital strategy, we will continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities, given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns.","We made significant progress in the second quarter advancing the execution of our development. Our active development pipeline now consist of 12 projects representing 4.8 million square feet with a total projected cost of $3.6 billion, up from $2.5 billion at year-end.","We have added to the active pipeline this year the vertical portion of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, 888 Boylston Street in Boston's Back Bay, 10 CityPoint and a related retail building in Waltham, Mass. and several other smaller developments.","We continue to be in the pre-development stage on another set of projects with strong potential in all our markets.","In the aggregate, our share of these projects represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.2 billion in gross development cost.","Let me now turn the discussion over to Doug for a more detailed review of our markets and performance.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start just with one brief comment on asset sales because I think it's important to reiterate. So last year, we sold about $1 billion of assets. And I would say, we had some pretty robust discussions about the near-term dilutive impact on our earnings and the accretive impact on our NAV of those decisions. And from the notes that I saw this morning, I think there's clearly attention in our earnings, in our short-term FFO numbers per share and the value that we are creating through the asset sale monetization perspective.","As we move forward with these additional sales, I just want to reiterate why we're doing what we're doing. So we believe that targeted sales today provide a greater asset level of value creation opportunity in holding the asset, collecting the cash flow and then timing and executing on evaluation at a later date, which again is subject to both risk [indiscernible] of interest rate as well as future sales valuation. It's an opportune time to create asset level value. That's what we're doing, even though it's going to come with some short-term earnings dilution. And we obviously have a timing issue because most of our new investment opportunities, as Owen just described, involve development not immediate property acquisitions. So we will find ourselves, in all likelihood, with an inability to quickly redeploy that cash and, therefore, we create another special dividend opportunity. But that's really the rationale that we're using for what we're doing on a global basis.","So let me talk a little bit about the markets now. It was an extraordinary 3 months in San Francisco. Year-to-date, there have been over 6.5 million square feet of leasing compared to about 9 million for all of 2013, which was a banner year. And it's been driven by large blocks from technology tenants that have really been forced to transition from what I would refer to as sort of a just-in-time real estate mentality to a long-term planning and decision-making mode of operation.","The top 10 tech deals totaled 1.2 million square feet in 2010. The top 10 deals to date this year totaled 3.2 million square feet. So clearly, the tickets are much, much larger. A few weeks ago, Google joined LinkedIn as a Valley headquarters firm that's made the decision to expand in the city with its lease at One Market place and a purchase of 188 Embarcadero Center, 2 traditional downtown financial office buildings.","Yelp, Splunk, Uber and, of course, Salesforce all made major expansion commitments during the quarter. We saw the law firm, Perkins Coie, who's a tenant in some subleased space at Embarcadero Center commit to Foundry III and with Google's lease at One Market, I think the stereotyping of where tenants want to locate becomes more and more difficult to predict, and the lines between what I refer to as tech buildings in tech locations and the traditional financial district assets really has begun to blend in a much more significant way.","Activity at 535 Mission continues to be robust. We anticipate completion of the building in the fourth quarter, and we will have physical occupancy before the end of the year. We have leased another 2 floors, we're at 100,000 square feet, and we have active proposals with 3 additional multi-floor tenants, all with 2015 occupancy, way above our expectations. We didn't have any additional leasing to report at Salesforce Tower, but I think the 700,000 square feet we do with Salesforce was a pretty good start. Construction is progressing. Our marketing center overlooking the site is now open and we're making lots of presentations.","The competing new construction pipeline has speculatively been fully committed, with the exception of the 420,000 square feet at 181 Fremont, which again is a small floor place building, 13,000 square feet of floor. And now the activity has switched to landfill in the next wave of development. The purchase of Salesforce Tower's land 1.5 years ago was $140 in FAR foot. The current bidding on the 2 entitled Mission Bay sites, so these are entitled sites, sold by Salesforce, bidding sold by Salesforce, are rumored to be in excess of $250 per rentable space. We are now focused on a number of next cycle developments with the increase in land prices, new construction costs are probably pushing towards $900 a square foot. And the one important factor that everyone now is going to start to consider and is being written about in all the periodicals and, I'm sure, it's being talked about on all the calls for people who have California interest, particularly in San Francisco, is that, lo and behold, the voter 875,000 square foot prop and limit on new commercial office development is suddenly going to be a governor on additional supply. While there's a deep prospective pipeline of additional projects that have been conceived, once the prop and allocation bank is depleted, which everyone, I think, projects will happen within the next 12 or so months, future approvals are going to be severely limited. So depending upon growth in demand, this may create a scarcity premium in the market for office rents.","Activity in Embarcadero Center is pretty restrained because we're at 95% occupancy. We completed 10 more deals this quarter totaling about 73,000 square feet. We continue to market the 3 great floors on EC4. And while we're in discussions with a few tenants, probably doesn't have a 2014 revenue impact. I think the sweet spot in the market right now for all transactions, Financial Center buildings, South of Market buildings is really in with a starting rent between $70 and $75 gross.","But with the lack of inventory, landlords, including us, are really seeking to try and push rents. And we're asking in excess of $80 a square foot for our best space. We'll see if we get it. Incoming tenants have adjusted to the market given the inability of them to have to spend money and move if they make a capital decision to relocate.","So we're feeling good about the prospects for -- in rental rate increases [indiscernible] California South of Market, California North of Market, California Financial District buildings over the next couple of quarters.","Net rents in Embarcadero Center in the second quarter generate some statistics for the supplemental show a 24% increase on leases that commence during the quarter, which is in line with what we've been talking about, which is basically a 15% to 25% markup over the next number of quarters and years.","Shifting to D.C. Our investment capital continues to be focused on new development. Construction at 601 Mass Ave is on schedule. We'll be delivering that building for -- to Arnold & Porter in October of 2015. We are moving forward with the design and permitting of 501 K Street in the district, as well as a 276,000 square foot office retail building and 2 additional residential buildings, with about 25,000 square feet of space, in the urban core of Reston. The earliest construction commencement for the Reston development, probably the third quarter of '15, and the K Street building is really going to be tenant-[indiscernible].","Now the greater D.C. market is probably the softest in our portfolio. Although as Mort said, Reston Town Center, which makes up 40% of our D.C. NOI, is outperforming the rest of the region in a big way.","When you think about our markets, Boston and San Francisco and New York City really have a more diversified tenant demand, while D.C. continues to roll [ph] in the legal industry and government and federal contractors the bulk of its activity. The sequestration and the budget deals from last year are actually still being felt in the contracting community and the GSA through both the nonrenewal of expiring contracts and the densification mandated by the GSA. And if you read the various market reports that are coming out from the brokers, I think it's pretty consistent with this.","We completed about 75,000 square feet of early renewals in Reston and about 75,000 square feet of leasing in D.C., but our critical D.C. activity right now, particularly in the CBD, is focused on retaining 3 major law firms that currently occupy about 800,000 square feet of space in our CBD portfolio, with 2017 to 2019 lease expirations. Now 70% of this portfolio was in JVs on a square foot and weighted basis. We've actually signed a Letter of Intent with the largest of these 3 tenants, and we believe we have an excellent chance of retaining the others. In total, they're going to be reducing their footprint by about 100,000 square feet or 13%. The good news is that the current in-service rents for the 3 leases is about $61 of square foot growth and we expect that the future rents are going to be 10% to 15% higher, each with their traditional D.C. 2% to 3% annual escalations built in.","Now in each case, the tenants are going to be rebuilding their space and we're going to be providing swing space at reduced economics until the build-out's complete. So as we mentioned in our previous call, these transactions will result in some transitional downtime that's going to impact our 2015 and 2016 revenues from these spaces.","In Reston, where we have no direct vacancy, no real inventory, there are a few tenants within the portfolio that for various reasons have put some sublet space on the market. So our leasing associates are spending most of their time replying to inquiries on how we can accommodate new tenants with direct or sub-deals on these spaces. We're actually in the midst of a 40,000 square foot take-back lease termination to accommodate a growing tenant in Reston Town Center today.","Turning to New York. There are a lot of large transactions announced in New York City during the last quarter, with Time and Bonnie downtown, Stony in Midtown South, and Neuberger Berman at 6th Avenue and Blackstone's renewal at 345 Park. But I think the takeaway is that Blackstone was the only expansion. There's been considerable velocity, but the overall availability coupled with the activity, which is still driven by lease expirations has really not resulted in any real changes in lease economics in Midtown, with a possible exception of the very small high end market where availability is much more limited. At 510 Madison, we did 4 more leases, including 2 floor deals at over $120 a square foot. And we're now over 91% leased with 1 floor and 3 of other prebuilt suites available.","We haven't increased our asking rents, but negotiating room has narrowed dramatically. Through the end of the second quarter, the level of leasing for space above $90 a square foot, which we referred to as the premium market in Midtown, is 40% higher than it was in 2013 at this time, with a dramatic pickup in the number of new leases versus renewals, which is a big change. Our primary focus in New York, like D.C., is on our tenant expirations between 2016 and beyond. We're actively involved with 6 law firms, leasing over 1.8 million square feet, on their possible renewals. While 2 of these firms are looking at possible expansion, the most are going to be looking for some kind of an occupancy reduction over the next 4 to 5 years.","So we have 2 transactions that are sort of in the documentation stage right now, and they encompass about 350,000 square feet. And the result is going to be a net giveback of about 40,000 square feet in 2015. The space we're taking back again is going to be used as non-revenue producing swing space for about 12 months as the tenants rebuild.","But on a combined basis, these first 2 renewals are going to result in a 15% roll-down on a cash basis and a 2% roll-down on a GAAP basis in '15. Now we actually expect these other transactions will all result in positive cash and GAAP roll-ups and that, in the aggregate, the total portfolio of 1.8 million square feet will see a significant positive mark-to-market as we get to the other 3 transactions.","At 250 West 55th Street, we completed 131,000 square feet of leasing, including the lease with Al Jazeera. So at 750,000 square feet, we're now 77% leased. We have only 4 prebuilt suites remaining. So in addition to focusing on the 1- and 2-floor prospects, we fully expect to break some more floors and continue our prebuilt program in the high rise. At Carnegie Center in the New York suburban market, we continue to gain both occupancy and extended leases. During the quarter, we executed 4 more leases for 75,000 square feet and we've got about 300,000 square feet of expansions and new demand under discussion.","We expect to be under construction with our new development for NRG towards the end of the third quarter.","Turning to Boston. Overall, the Boston office market continues to improve, our development activities are continuing to advance and we have included 3 new projects in our development section of our supplemental, which I'll give you a little bit of color on. At the Prudential Center, we signed lease with Natixis for 130,000 square feet and they have the right to go up to 150,000 square feet at the base of 888 Boylston Street, so that's floors 4 through 8 or 9. This is our new 365,000 square foot office development, which is on top of 60,000 square feet of new retail, which will be integral to The Shops at the Prudential Center. In addition, we're planning a complete renovation of our quick serve food operation and potentially a 17,000 square foot second story addition to the portion of the Boylston Arcade. These 2 retail projects will have a cost of somewhere between $30 million and $40 million, and that's not included in our construction of progress just yet, probably comes on into the program next quarter.","We have begun the temporary closing of a portion of the retail, which will eventually impact about 22,000 square feet in our food court and reduce our overall revenue in '14 and '15 before we reopen with an additional 17,000 square feet. Now current inline rents at the Prudential retail are in excess of $150 a square foot.","At the Hancock Tower, we're 5 months away from the expiration of our State Street lease, which is going to result in 2 blocks of availability at the building. We'll have a 170,000 square foot block at the base, which we're rebranding as 120 St. James, where we are creating a second lobby and entrance dedicated to the low rise and designed to attract technology and other creative tenants with its larger floors and floor-to-ceiling glass. Now the tight conditions in Cambridge and the influx of startups in the Boston area have really led to a rising new demand for office space from a nontraditional user in Boston.","Wayfair, which is an online home shopping retailer, has expanded at Copley Place. Sonus has relocated from Cambridge to the Financial District. Autodesk is moving from the suburbs to the Seaport. World Winter, which is the parent company of the Game Show Network and Rapid7, which is a security company, have expanded and moved to 100 Summer Street. The Cambridge Innovation Center, note the name, opened a second location in downtown Boston and WeWork has now 2 sites with over 100,000 square feet and is looking for additional locations. Lots of untraditional demand in the Boston market at this point.","The other major block of the Hancock is at the top of the tower, 145,000 square feet, which we will get back once we move in E&Y down into 4 of the State Street floors in the lower third of the building. And that's going to occur in the middle of 2015. So a little bit of extended downtime. While we have a big pickup in vacancy, the average in-place rent for those 2 blocks is about $40 gross and our expected starting rent is over $60 gross. This quarter, we leased 140,000 square feet of Hancock Tower at an average starting rent of over $65 gross. The suburban market in Boston continues to be very active, led by expansion of the life sciences and the tech businesses. Large blocks of space have disappeared, forcing larger tenants to consider new construction.","Rents in Waltham continue to rise, an average to mid-'40s for new construction. We completed just over 100,000 square feet of leases in Waltham and Lexington this quarter. And in addition, we signed a lease with Wolverine, parent company for a number of shoe brands, for 155,000 square feet at 10 CityPoint, which will kick off our 230,000 square-foot office building and 16,000 square feet of retail space. And just down the Street, we're starting a 16,000 square-foot stand-alone retail building with a future of residential\/hotel pad site. We've signed 2 full service restaurant leases, totaling about 13,000 square feet, and while it's a small investment, it enhances the amenity base for CityPoint, where we have 516,000 square feet of existing office space; 1.2 million square feet of additional office density, including 10 and 20; as well as 1.3 million square feet of other space at this interchange. In total, our new developments added this quarter are about $425 million, not just the Boston stuff, and are anticipated to yield in excess of 8% on a cash NOI basis.","In Cambridge, where we're 100% leased, we anticipate making our formal permanent submittal over the next few months for our new residential building, which we hope to start in the first half of '15. In addition to the residential development, we're working in concert with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority in the city of Cambridge on a 600,000 square-foot office and 400,000 square-foot residential density increase at our Cambridge Center project. In the meantime, there are 3 major tenants looking for blocks in excess of 150,000 square feet of office and lab space in Kendall Square as we speak. Office rents, as exemplified by our recent early renewals, are in the mid 60s to low 70s on a gross basis, which is an increase of over 50% since 2012.","To sum up, it's been one of the busiest summers we can remember, and we are really encouraged by both the level of activity we're seeing across the portfolio and the development opportunities that sit before us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm going to start with a quick recap of our performance for the second quarter. Our portfolio had a strong quarter. Same-store NOI was up 3.5% on a GAAP basis and 8.1% on a cash basis from last year. We have been projecting growth in our same-store, and it's primarily related to occupancy increases in suburban Boston and Princeton and at 510 and 540 Madison Avenue in New York City, as well as strong rent rollups on expiring leases in Cambridge and in San Francisco. We also have free rent burning off from prior period leasing that is driving some of the cash rent growth, particularly at the Hancock Tower, at 510 Madison Avenue, 399 Park Avenue and Patriots Park.","For the quarter, we reported funds from operation of $1.35 per share, that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our rental revenues were in line with our expectations, and we experienced about $4 million of lower than projected operating expenses. The majority of the expense savings were in repair and maintenance items, and we expect to incur most of them in the second half of 2014. So the savings will not entirely flow into the full year.","We generated $1.5 million of better than projected development and management services income with stronger service income in our New York City building portfolio, and we brought online development fees associated with our 2 new joint ventures where we started construction at Annapolis Junction 8, and we have commenced permitting and design work at 501 K Street.","We also had a little bit lower than expected G&A expenses due to higher capitalized wages associated with this quarter's leasing productivity and higher development activities.","The combination of these items resulted in about $6 million or $0.04 per share of outperformance. However, it was offset by $0.02 per share of nonrecurring items, including disposition transaction costs and an adjustment to our noncontrolling interest in property partnerships of $2.4 million. Next quarter, the run rate of our noncontrolling interest in property partnerships is expected to return to about $19 million per quarter.","As we look at the rest of 2014, we don't expect much change to our prior projections. Since the majority of our current leasing activity involves transactions with revenue impact in 2015 and beyond, the most significant change for the remainder of this year will come from our asset sales activity.","As Owen mentioned, we're selling some of our flex buildings in Mountain View, our long-term government-leased Patriots Park portfolio in Reston and 2 land parcels. These assets are unencumbered and currently contribute annual FFO of $23 million or $0.13 per share. We anticipate closing these within the next 60 days, and the projected impact to 2014 is the loss of approximately $8 million of FFO or $0.05 per share.","The in-service portfolio continues to perform with solid same-store NOI growth coming from positive mark-to-market on expiring leases and occupancy improvement. Our occupancy improved this quarter to 93%. However, due to the anticipated lease expirations, our occupancy is expected to tick down in the second half, an average between 92.5% and 93%, for the rest of the year, which is slightly better than our prior guidance.","And just a few details, we expect to lose occupancy at The Prudential Center with Arnold Communications, who's vacating 180,000 square feet, which will be backfilled by Blue Cross Blue Shield, but not until April of 2015. We're also getting the 26th floor back at the GM Building at the end of this month, and we're losing about 100,000 square feet of occupancy in our VA 95 R&D Park in Springfield, Virginia. These known moveouts totaled 75 basis points of loss occupancy and are partially offset by anticipated positive absorption elsewhere in the portfolio.","On a same-store basis, we project our GAAP NOI to improve from 2013 by 2% to 2.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the low end from our last quarter's guidance. On a cash basis, we expect moderation from the second quarter results due to the aforementioned lease expirations, but we're still projecting strong same-store cash NOI growth of 5% to 6% from 2013.","Our noncash straight-line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $93 million to $99 million for the year, up slightly in connection with our -- in conjunction with our GAAP NOI guidance increase.","We continue to enhance our development pipeline both in terms of adding new projects and leasing up our existing projects. This quarter, we added 5 new developments. They totaled 840,000 square feet and $425 million of total investment. In addition to 280,000 square feet of preleasing in these 5 new developments, this quarter, we also leased 95,000 square feet of space in our other office developments, which are now 70% leased in the aggregate.","Our Avant residential project in Reston had a strong quarter. It absorbed 95 units and is now 55% leased.","Nearly all of the office leasing in our developments is for lease commencement in 2015, so the projected 2014 contribution for our developments is really unchanged from last quarter.","We project an incremental contribution to 2014 full year FFO from these projects of $28 million to $30 million. The FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures is projected to be $29 million to $32 million for the year. We generated stronger than expected development and management services income this quarter; and for the full year, we're now projecting $22 million to $25 million, an increase of $3 million at the midpoint. And for our G&A, our projections are unchanged and we anticipate 2014 expense of $100 million to $104 million.","We project our capitalized interest to be higher than last quarter -- in last quarter's guidance due to the commencement of new developments that were not included in our prior guidance. This will lower our 2014 interest expense, and we now project 2014 full year net interest expense of $444 million to $448 million, an improvement of about $2 million from last quarter.","For the remainder of 2014, our quarterly interest expense run rate is actually going to increase due to the cessation of capitalized interest for 250 West 55th Street and 680 Folsom Street by the end of the third quarter. Included in our second quarter results is $8.5 million of capitalized interest from these 2 properties.","In summary, we are modifying our 2014 guidance range for funds from operation to $5.24 to $5.29 per share. Adjusting for the $0.05 per share of loss FFO from our asset sales, this equates to a $0.03 per share increase in the midpoint of our guidance from last quarter. The increasing guidance is from a combination of better than projected same property NOI, higher development and management services income, and lower interest expense. For the third quarter, we project funds from operation of $1.36 to $1.38 per share.","I want to spend a minute on our outlook for 2015 because there are a couple of things Doug mentioned that are important as you consider 2015. The first item is the dilution related to our disposition activity. As I mentioned, our dispositions have a current annual aggregate FFO contribution of $0.13 per share. We lose a portion in 2014, so you can expect the reduction in FFO year-over-year to be approximately $0.09 per share.","The second item is interest expense. Assuming we simply refinance the $550 million of 5.5% yield in unsecured debt we have expiring next year, at current market rates, our interest expense should decline. However, the projected reduction in cash interest expense is expected to be fully offset by a decrease in our capitalized interest because our 2015 development spend does not ramp up fast enough to make up for the development cost that we delivered in 2014. In total, we expect our net interest expense to be relatively static year-to-year.","The third item is the impact of transition in the portfolio that will have a short-term impact on our 2015 occupancy and our same-store performance. As Doug detailed, in Boston, we expect to lose 315,000 square feet of occupancy at the Hancock Tower and we're taking a portion of the high-value Prudential retail shops out of service in 2015.","In addition, we have another 100,000 square feet of vacancies coming at the Prudential Tower and 100 Federal Street. While this space is currently below market and upon releasing should result in higher income, we expect downtime during 2015. We also expect to complete early renewals with several large law firms over the next 12 months, which could result in 200,000 square feet of either vacancy or non-income-producing swing space for a period of time. Again, this is all highly marketable space, but we anticipate some income interruption in 2015.","In general, we anticipate that we could experience an average same-store occupancy decline of 50 to 100 basis points next year, which would hamper our same-store revenue growth. On the positive side, the contribution of our development deliveries is projected to drive 2015 FFO growth. Even though, 250 West 55th Street will not be fully stabilized in 2015, as some of the leases will not commence until later in the year, we project revenue recognition from an average of 75% of the building versus 25% in 2014. 680 Folsom is now 98% leased with 440,000 square feet of leases that commenced this quarter and the remaining 70,000 square feet commencing at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 2015 will be a fully stabilized year for the project. We will also start to see a contribution from 535 Mission Street with our first tenant taking occupancy at the end of 2014. And last, The Avant project in Reston is projected to complete its lease-up by the end of 2014 and be fully stabilized in 2015.","I also would like to cover the impact that our disposition program may have on our dividend. The sale of the 2 office assets demonstrate the significant value that we're able to create through the development, repositioning and releasing process. The projected gain is $140 million on an aggregate value of $413 million, which results in an unleveraged IRR in excess of 14%. If we're unable to defer the gains through future investments, we could have a special dividend of approximately $0.80 per share later this year. And to the extent we sell additional assets, that special dividend could be larger. We're not currently projecting any changes in our regular quarterly dividend.","The only other item I'd like to mention is that we're planning on holding our next Investor conference this fall. With Boston having many of our new developments that we've just announced, as well as exciting future pipeline deals, we will be having it in Boston on September 22 and 23. You can all expect additional information from Arista on this shortly, and we certainly look forward to seeing everyone. That completes our formal remarks. I'd appreciate if the operator would open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first call comes from Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Owen, I think in your opening comments, you talked a little bit about pursuing some additional development sites and some acquisitions. You talked about $100 million in D.C. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on the development opportunities and sort of where -- what markets they're in. Are they more mixed-use space than just pure office development, and sort of give us a little bit of sense of size?","Owen D. Thomas","Michael, the answer to your question is varied. We're looking for new development and acquisition opportunities in all of our markets. We're not focused on any one particular market. I would say, the -- in San Francisco, we pursued multiple sites. I would say the acquisition activity that we have in San Francisco has been much more focused on development as opposed to existing product. In Washington, I mentioned, the smaller acquisition that we're working on. In terms of developments, we've talked about 501 K Street, which -- where we have a joint venture on a site and we're seeking an anchor tenant to construct that building. We also have developments that we are considering related to the Reston Town Center. In New York, we are looking at acquisitions and development opportunities. And in Boston, I'd say, we are probably a little more focused on executing the robust pipeline that we're working on as opposed to identifying any new projects that we haven't announced. It's a little bit all over the place.","Douglas T. Linde","I mean, Michael, just to sort of reiterate what we said in past calls, so in Boston, we have the North Station development, which is in excess of 1.8 million square feet, of which we're -- we presumably will be a 50% partner with Delaware North, and that's a 2015 start, which is not in our numbers anywhere. There's been some reports about the conversations we're having regarding the -- what's referred to the 100 Clarence Street garage, which is a site that, in all likelihood, could support some additional development, and we're working diligently with Mass Department of Transportation on figuring out a way to untap a couple of those sites, and those are in excess of 600,000 or 700,000 square feet apiece. We've got another building at 10 and 20 CityPoint, which we could build and then there's another close to 350,000 square feet of permitting that we're going to be getting accomplished in August for another building associated with the site that we're selling. And then, as I said, we have the Cambridge development. So that's a pretty big pipeline in Boston. In Washington, D.C., as Owen said, 501 K Street is a development that we are drawing right now, and Ray and his team are making active leasing proposals, and we're optimistic that someone is going to step up and take a very significant portion of that and allow us to get started some time in '15 or 16. In Reston, we have the 2 major developments in the urban core, which is 275,000 square-foot of building, which I described, as well as the signature site, which is another 500-plus thousand square feet of residential, which given our success at The Avant, we're very encouraged by. And then we have the Gateway site, which is another 2-plus million square feet of incremental development on top of the 500,000 square feet that we currently have at what's referred to as Reston Corporate Center, our 250,000 square feet of Reston Corporate Center. So there's a lot of potential development right there. In New York City, John Powers, as we would say, is up to bat with a lot of pitches coming at him. And there are a few that we're moving forward with -- in an expedition -- expedited basis. We're not prepared to talk about where they are or what they are, but they're not insignificant in terms of size, hundreds of millions of dollars. And then, in San Francisco, in addition to the Salesforce Tower and 535 Mission and 690 Folsom Street, Bob is in active discussions with a number of landowners about what I would refer to as next cycle developments, which are developments that will be predicated on 2 things happening. One, the central SoMa business district plan being passed by the city's planning authorities, and then the way the city has to go about it allocating its development resources with regards to the prop M allocation, assuming, as everyone expects, that we're going to get into the situation where there's going to be a limit. So those are the sort of the short-term things that we're looking at, which I think is billions of dollars of development in its total capacity.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And it sounds like certainly over the next 18 months, that clearly well over $1 billion could be added to the pipeline.","Douglas T. Linde","Those are your words, but I'm not going to disagree with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","On the Trulia lease commitment of 535 and then maybe just in general, if you can expand on the types of tenants that are expressing interest in Transbay and 535 these days, and maybe what kind of timing you might expect for reaching 90% leased at those 2 projects.","Douglas T. Linde","So, Jed, could you please repeat your question again because you got cut off at the beginning of it so I didn't hear the earliest part of it.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","The first part of it was just whether the Zillow\/Trulia merger might have any impact on Trulia lease commitment there at 535?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. Trulia was the first lease we signed. And during their process of being acquired or merging, depending upon your perspective, with Zillow, they approved and signed a lease extension. And they're building up this space, as we speak -- expansion, excuse me. So our strong inclination is that, as Dave said, they're going to be running 2 brands. And Zillow has a relatively small office in San Francisco and that they will fully be occupying the space that they've taken at 535. With regards to the other demand at 535 Mission and the Transbay Tower, which by the way we don't call it anymore, it's called the Salesforce Tower, which is the way we should be referring to it. We are seeing what I would refer to as a number of the traditional legal financial services oriented lease expiration driven requirements -- the major banks and law firms. And then we are making presentations and having conversations with a lot of the -- what I refer to as the technology or the new economy companies that Mort was describing, that are growing exponentially in San Francisco. As I described, they're very chunky and they're very large, and everyone is looking forward from a planning perspective because they all see the day when there's not much in the of way of blocks of space available, and Transbay Tower happens to be the one place where, right now, there is a block of space that is available for occupancy. With regards to the -- when we get to 95%, if all the leases that we are in discussions with at 535 actually were to happen, we would be basically 95% before the end of the year. I can't tell you whether or not all those leases are going to occur, but we have active proposals out that encompass more than 100% of the available square footage, which is 207,000 square feet.","Michael E. LaBelle","Although we may be able to sign those leases, they wouldn't commence the rent until mid to later '15 at best.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And Salesforce Tower, you feel like you might be able to reel in another bigger tenant this year?","Douglas T. Linde","We are optimistic about the market. We are -- we feel that Salesforce Tower is an incredibly exciting project. And we are in no sort of rush to lease the next space, but if a tenant comes along that is looking for a block of space and is prepared to have an economic discussion with us, we are prepared to do another lease.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just to follow up, some of your competitors have talked about the flattening of the Manhattan office market and sort of a general shift to the south and west on the island. And just curious if you can talk about the extent to which year you're feeling that in your portfolio. And then does it sort of change how you're thinking about your longer-term footprint in Manhattan?","Douglas T. Linde","John Powers, do you want to take that one?","John Francis Powers","Well, there is certainly a lot of activity in Midtown South. That's the hottest market in Manhattan and that relates very much to Owen's opening comment about the increase in tech in the more steady-state and some decline in the law firm with steady-state and are unchanging in the financial service industry. The high-end law firms, or high-end financial firms are still very strong in Midtown. And we see a very good market here in Midtown. We don't see the positive growth or the spillover to downtown is getting because it's price advantaged.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm here with Jamie Feldman, too. Our first question, I guess, is on the development pipeline. And can you just talk to us a little bit about the size you're comfortable with versus the risks of development?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. We've had this conversation, I think from time to time during our history, and I'll start with the following, which is we are opportunity constrained not capital constrained. We are a $30 billion enterprise right now. And at any one time, having a series of projects that are in different stages of development from conception to leasing to coming and going into service of a $1 billion or $2 billion is not something that we are at all uncomfortable with. We've described the issues associated with development in the past, regarding the issues with permitting, the issues with construction and the issues with leasing, and we feel like we are really good at managing all of those issues. And that on the leasing side, the issues associated with new development and the issues associated with lease expiration driven vacancy are not too dissimilar. And often times, the advantage is associated with new construction and the changes in the way people are using space and the attractive nature of being able to move into a new environment relative to -- in the example that we're dealing with right now, having to rebuild over a 12- to 18-month period of time and having to swing through it actually create an incentive and an advantage to development. So it puts us in a position where we feel even more comfortable taking the leasing risk on certain developments, particularly when we have a major commitment for a portion of it, a.k.a. 888 Boylston Street than we necessarily have with the risks associated with our \"availability in our portfolio.\"","Michael E. LaBelle","The other thing to recall, Jeff, is that these developments cycle through. So for example, we have a $3.5 billion pipeline today, but $1.7 billion of it is delivering in the next 6 months or is delivered effectively. And by the way, those are primarily leased, 77% leased to 250. You're basically 100% leased to 680, which is the 2 biggest ones that are delivering. So again, when you think about percentage of overall company size, we don't anticipate it increasing to a level that will be significantly more than what it is now as a percentage of company at any one time.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just wanted to focus, I guess, on law firms. I mean, one of the -- obviously, one of the tenants that has been downsizing. We appreciate your comments on next year. With M&A picking up this year, I guess, we were hoping to maybe hear that some of the discussions have changed a bit more recently. Is that -- I guess, that's not the case. The law firms you're speaking with, they're still talking about downsizing space in the coming years. Nothing has really changed there.","Douglas T. Linde","Well, Jeff, there are 2 things that are going on, okay. So the first is that any law firm, and I don't care whether they're in the M&A business or the patent and trade business or the litigation business, that has an installation that was built 15 or 20 years ago, by definition, is looking at the way they're utilizing that space very differently. And we talked about this before, law libraries and the way conference rooms are used and the more uniform nature associated with the way offices are built out and the lack of secretarial or administrative report stations[ph] -- that in itself is creating a reduction in the total overhead of occupied space necessary for a law firm. Then, there are, in fact, mergers and acquisitions going on within law firms. I mean, so some of those firms are growing. And then, there are business unit differentiations. So, as an example, firms that have -- maybe had a significant bankruptcy practice, probably are in more of a downsizing mode than those firms that are in the patent and trade and for a biotechnology complex, right? So as I said, we actually have, in New York City, of the 6 firms that we're talking to, 2 of them were actually looking to maintain the same amount of space and that's after rebuilding it. So that would imply some growth for a few of them. And then, we have others depending upon their business practices and how much space they have that are going in other direction. So I think that, any law firm that has an installation that's probably pre-2007 is -- can find efficiency. And we're still -- I refer to the sort of the sixth or seventh inning of the continuum in the law firm world of tenants moving through their footprints and getting to sort of what I would refer to as the right size environment.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate those thoughts. And Jamie just has one quick question.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, just a quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. Michael, are able to quantify the FFO impact of the transitional leases in 2015?","Michael E. LaBelle","We're not going to give guidance for '15 today. I think the challenge that we have is that I described that 500,000 or 700,000 square feet of space, which is over 100 basis points of our space that is going to be going through transition. So with that kind of occupancy loss, we do continue to have roll-ups, particularly in San Francisco, where we hope we will see positive absorption. In New York City, there is opportunity to grow occupancy. Then we'll have roll-ups in Boston. So if those may offset each other, we'll see, but it's some headwind to having real kind of same-store growth in 2015.","Operator","Your next question is from John Guinee.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Three quick questions. First, on your law firm deals, I guess, Doug, can you give us just a basic number in terms of price dollars per square foot for releasing costs, TI, leasing commission, base building upgrades, how that tends to be split between BXP and the tenant? And is there any security obtained in this day and age for those kind of capital commitments? And then maybe this is also yours, Doug, but if I look back at your land inventory, about 9 million square feet of developable square feet and then another 2 million of options, do you have sort of near-term plans to either develop or monetize those? And then the third question would be for our friend, Ray Ritchey, if he can talk about what's happening in the DC market excluding the CBD and excluding Reston Town Center with the opening of the Silver Line.","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. So let me see if I can do this succinctly. With regard to leasing costs associated with major law firms in cities like Washington and New York, where it's most germane for our purposes, a new transaction, okay so it's kind of moving into a new installation. It's probably getting in Washington, D.C., a tenant improvement allowances of up between $100 and $110 a square foot, and in New York City, it's somewhere between $65 and $80 a square foot. In New York, we believe that the cost of a new installation is somewhere in excess of $200 a square foot when you factor in furniture cabling and everything else, and in D.C., it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $175 a square foot. So that is the sort of costs. These deals are all different in terms of what's actually going on, and traditionally, in New York City, there's free rent associated with the move for the build-out time, so to the extent that a tenant is in place and they're not getting free rent, there's a transition of those economics to either rent or into additional TIs, and similarly in Washington, D.C. And then depending upon the age of the building, there may or may not be base building improvements that are required. So as an example, a building like 599, we are undertaking a lobby renovation because we think it's the right thing to do for the building, independent of the lease expiration. And the building work that's being done on elevators, for example, is sort of outside of a change to the tenant improvement, so that's not part of those costs. And that's obviously amortized over the entire value of the building over a much longer period of time. And then there are cases -- in cases where a building -- in one of the buildings we're looking in Washington, D.C., we may do a major gut rehab and change the entire HVAC system because we think that the building has gone past its useful life and we think it's the right thing to do both for the tenant and for the building, and those costs would all be on our side of the equation. So that's sort of -- that's the first question.","Raymond A. Ritchey","I would also add, Doug, of the commissions that are forthcoming on these transactions, well, the biggest change is we're seeing the law firms participate greatly in the commission. So the commission could be $25 to $35 a square foot, but the law firms are going to harvest back between $15 and $20 of that, so that helps offset some of the costs associated with the build-out through the law firms' participation of the commissions.","Douglas T. Linde","So with regards to our land inventory, John, I think we are working through 2 things. One is, there are certain sites that we are aggressively developing, a.k.a. things like 888 Boylston Street. And then there are others sites that we are aggressively trying to sell. So as an example, we have a land inventory in Rockville, Maryland associated with our Tower Oaks project, and we are looking to actually have an agreement with a non-office building owner to convert that land and permit that land into a different use, stick-built or multifamily or single-purpose, single-family homes, and we would be selling some of that land in manners like that. Again, we're selling a parcel out at the Broad Run project. We're selling a parcel of land that we have in Waltham because we're getting a terrific price and it's improving the environment around it. So over time, I'd say, we are working through that, and then a lot of that land, we hope to develop ourselves.","Raymond A. Ritchey","And your third question, John, regarding the DC market, were you're asking specifically about the Silver Line or just the market in general?","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Essentially, if you look at the core urban markets, Crystal City, Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, Tysons, with the Silver Line, Southwest, they seem to be surprisingly anemic, unless you can tell me otherwise.","Raymond A. Ritchey","No, I would fully support that position. The vacancy in Crystal City and in Rosslyn is approaching 30%. And the recently announced CEB deal was a little bit of a head fake in that while they're going to take down half of the new JBG building, or about 350,000 square feet, the space they're leaving behind equal to the amount of space they're taking. And thus, JBG is going to add 300,000 square feet to the market. So this will push the availability vacancy rate in excess of 30% in Rosslyn. And then in Crystal City, Pentagon City, you have the TSA out with a major procurement that may continue to show some continued erosion in that market itself. So while the Silver Line, I think, is going to be great long-term, and specifically for us in Reston Town Center, is going to create that development opportunity that Doug mentioned earlier, that $2.5 million to $3 million feet, certainly, in the short term, the Silver Line has done very little to impact or improve the market conditions in the RB corridor or in Tysons Corner.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping that you could touch more on what you're thinking on a potential for new JVs. First, are those included in the $1 billion of asset sales that you're think about for this year, or is that in addition to the $1 billion? And then, you said that they're likely to take the form of what you already did in Times Square. So should we be thinking about these mostly focused on New York office?","Owen D. Thomas","Yes. It's Owen. So to answer your question, what we said about dispositions for this year is that we felt that they would be in excess of $1 billion, and we'll continue with that guidance. I referenced the Times Square joint venture that we did last year as an example of something that we might consider for this year. And to go back to the merits of that, we were able to -- we feel monetized a portion of an asset at a terrific pricing. We retained the leasing and the management of the building, and we also retained the upside that was in the interest of that we owned. And then lastly, no, I wouldn't say that we would consider joint ventures only in New York. We might consider our own assets outside of New York as well.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the decision pool, The Avenue off the market. I realized that you can have issues with any given buyer, but what's the thought process on completely pulling it off the market versus just trying to line up a different buyer?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, I think -- this is the Ray. We're considering the overall position of The Avenue book, the office building and the apartment building. And while -- let's put it this way. Our discussion with the current buyer has ceased. And we're evaluating where we go forward either with the buyer that has been considering the properties for the last 2 or 3 months, whether we take it back to the market or we continue to own it for the long haul. I mean, listen, it is a phenomenal asset that continues to perform in the best location in Washington D.C., and this was not a -- this was clearly trying to take advantage of industry environment and the interest from a capital markets for trophy-level properties like The Avenue. And certainly, nothing has happened that has distinguished that or altered our approach towards in our viewpoint of that asset.","Operator","The next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Following up on an earlier question. Outside of West 55th there's no other New York development currently underway. And you mentioned you're looking at other opportunities, but given that New York is one of your largest markets, the fact that it's clearly at present not one of your larger development markets, is that just a matter of timing? Could it one day be one of your top development markets? Or do you think you just have better long-term opportunities in other cities? And related to that, is expanding into another district in New York City -- I think you touched on that a little bit earlier, but is that a realistic near-term possibility?","Douglas T. Linde","As a public company, we've developed $3 million square-foot towers in Midtown Manhattan, and we think we've been highly successful at creating value to that process. We have a new Regional Manager in the form of John Powers, who has I think both a desire and an expectation to dramatically ramp up our activities in New York City, commensurate with the opportunities that he can find. And there is a significant desire to extend and expand our New York City outreach in terms of development as well as other types of transactions. And we've discussed in the past that we would consider doing residential, not unlike what we're doing in Washington and we're doing in Boston, at this point on a new development perspective as well. And again, as we said earlier in the call, we're opportunity-starved, not capital-starved. And so, we're focused on trying to grow that.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Good to hear. And then, shifting gears, could you discuss retail strength in Boston and the inclusion of retail in your projects like 888 Boylston, how integral is retail to the overall appeal of the project? And then longer term, do you see the non-office mix for BXP -- you just mentioned residential, but do you see the non-office mix with resi and retail moving any higher than it is currently?","Douglas T. Linde","So, I'll break this into suburban and urban, okay? So from an urban perspective, having the right cachet associated with any of the buildings that we have in the form of what I would refer to as amenity-driven retail is pretty important. But when you're in the city, you also happen to be in a network where there are a lot of alternatives, right? So there are restaurants and dry cleaners and drug stores and hard goods and soft goods sellers of other things that are around that. The Prudential Center in itself is very different because it is effectively a regional mall in an urban location. And it's one of the highest producing productivity malls that we're aware of. I mean, it's over $1,000 a square foot, and it sells per square foot. An it's got both soft goods as well as restaurant and ancillary products and hard goods like -- Microsoft has a store here. Well, as we think about new developments across all of our markets, we are exceedingly aware that the old idea of having a suburban office park with a cafeteria in it is not the ideal mix for a tenant and a group of tenants that want to go into a location like that. So where we can, we're amenitizing and providing as much in the way of additional services to our customers, our tenants as we possibly can. And in the case of, for example, what we're doing in CityPoint, creating restaurants that have a full-service menu, where you can both get breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a cocktail after 6:00 at night or whatever time you want to have your cocktail, is a pretty big draw for those tenants that are looking for an environment where they're trying to recruit and retain the best employees. And relative to going to a suburban office building that it really doesn't have that availability, it is a strong advantage and something we are acutely trying to bring to as many of our properties as we possibly can. And if you think about the cluster that we have, we talked about trying to create these clusters of great place, great space. And so it's a pretty strong focus of what we are trying to do, but we are not trying to become a major retail owner of space in an absentee perspective aside from how we're dealing with our office buildings.","Bryan J. Koop","Some additional discussion on the retail. This is Bryan Koop. At The Prudential Center, as Doug mentioned, we're performing already at over $1,000 a square foot. We're very fortunate that we have a considerable role coming up. We have an opportunity to take -- we're performing at $1,000 a square foot. And that's what many performers and they're at $400, $500 a square foot. There's going to be opportunity to bring new, exciting retailers to produce at higher levels. And then when we look at 888, it's a really great, perfect combination of being able to support that building, but also enhance, call it, with greater destinations on Boylston Street for the rest of The Prudential Center. So we're really optimistic about the next few years of retail at The Prudential Center.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm just curious. A number of your peers have been quite active on the Manhattan street retail scene. And I don't want to say you guys have been noticeably or notably absent because you do obviously have some street retail in a couple of buildings, but you haven't done any one-off deals. Could you just give us your perspective on that niche of the market and how you're thinking about it going forward?","Douglas T. Linde","This is a not terribly well-informed answer, but I'll give you my perspective, and others may have a different one, which is we have not focused on buying individual condominium interest in high-value potential long-term lease rollover Manhattan, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Broadway, and Times Square retail as a strategy, because we're focusing on trying to put dollars to work in the office residential business in bigger volumes than that. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's an opportunity to create value there. I mean, as you said, we have, in excess of $60 million of revenue, and most of it is NOI. It's just that the 767 Fifth Avenue, that's the General Motors Building, and we have a 100,000 square feet of space there, so we have a pretty significant, relatively speaking, volume of that. And we are working really hard right now figuring out ways to significantly enhance the assets that we have on the 53rd and Lexington and Park corridor, a.k.a. 601, the Citibank -- the former Citibank building, as well as 399, to really create value and significantly increase the revenue potential of the street-level retail in those buildings. So it's not that we're not thinking about it. It's just we've not been focused on going out and buying a sort of one-off and creating a business like that.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the second question I had was on Reston Town Center, and specifically given the pricing that you achieved on Patriots Park, and what I consider Reston Town Center to be, which is kind of an oasis in the middle of a suburban D.C. office desert, is that an asset you've ever considered selling or JV-ing and focusing your efforts in D.C. sort of in a more high-rise urban footprint?","Raymond A. Ritchey","I'll answer that one. This is Ray Ritchey. And by the way, I'm in the Boston office today. I mean, it's just magic. It's just wonderful to be up here with these people. I can say that from our perspective in Washington that the Reston asset is a core asset not only today, but the future of that specific region is very much sized to the continuous success of Reston Town Center. And that while we are an oasis in a desert, we are a very large oasis and dominate the market. And we see even in times of softness in the surrounding markets, our ability to continue to outperform, and this is before the metro comes. And any future supply that will have a similar type of amenity base, and thus attracts them to the tenant, we control. So this is the market that we dominate today and we'll dominate in the future. And others in this table may have a different opinion, but they'll get a stronger argument against the Washington contingent, if that's in fact the case.","Douglas T. Linde","I'd just put it in a slightly less personal context, which is that we believe that there continues to be an opportunity for strong growth in the Reston market. And that's both for the appreciation of the cash flows in the existing assets, we reinvest in those assets and make them better -- a.k.a. from what we're looking at doing, for example, with the retail in Fountain Square. And then we have -- as I suggested, we've got 750,000 square feet of immediate development, and we have another 2 million to 3 million square feet of longer-term development until we look at what we can create and what we can grow, invest in. And I guess, to the extent that at some point, we felt there was no growth left in it, we feel differently. But right now, our crystal ball tells us that this cluster in this particular location has a really strong long-term growth prospect, and that it's the kind of place we should be investing on money and see strong increases in our cash flow over a long time period.","Raymond A. Ritchey","Also, the past part disposition was a long-term 20-year lease. So real upsize for a long period of time at a very attractive capital environment. So that was more -- but the sale was more opportunistic and not indicative of the company's commitment to Reston.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions here. First, maybe it's for John. But as you guys look at New York, just given the way land pricing has gone, are you still able to sort of find deals where you can outright own the land? Or are you increasingly looking at ground lease situations? And, by extension, are you also having to look at situations where it's either a combination with residential or hotel to make the numbers work? Just sort of curious just with the bid from condos, curious if straight-up office deals, fee simple ownership, still if you can make them [ph] and sell.","Douglas T. Linde","John, do you want -- he addressed the question to you, so","John Francis Powers","It's a very difficult market. There's a lot of money-shaking deals here, and it's very difficult. So my approach is not to focus on the books that I get but to try to be innovative and proactive in the market and look for other type of opportunities. And I think we're making some inroads, but nothing that we can announce here.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. But do you think that we'll see either ground lease situations or mixed-use situation, as you announced, future New York or borough deals?","John Francis Powers","I would say, we're open to all of that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then for Ray, if you can just give some color on the D.C. acquisition. Maybe I missed it in the MD&A. But is this a redevelopment play? Is this a major lease expiration, where the reason you're buying it is because you're comfortable you've got a tenant to back that. So just sort of curious, some color on the D.C. acquisition.","Douglas T. Linde","This is Doug. We don't feel comfortable talking about what the D.C. acquisition is at this point because it's an off-market letter of intent that we're approaching, and obviously it's a transaction that Ray has found that we think there's great long-term value creation opportunities on, but it's not appropriate to talk any more about it at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to take the other side of Ross' question, if I could. I'm just curious about in terms of D.C., you've got this oasis in Reston that seems to have this natural barriers to entry. Whereas, in the district, there don't seem to be huge barriers to entry like we see in some of the other cities that you're focused and even in Reston with construction continuing in some big potential sites. What are the thoughts surrounding sort of paring that portion of the D.C. exposure and maybe concentrating more in Reston?","Douglas T. Linde","So let me just give you some historical context about what we've done in D.C. because I think it's important in answering the question. So the vast majority of our holdings in D.C. were done through development, ground-up development, where we have found either sites or landowners who had sites, and we've done joint ventures with those parties in order to be in the value creation business on a long-term basis. There have been 1 or 2 acquisitions that have been done in what I would refer to as transitional times when the capital markets were struggling and we had the availability of funds to buy buildings at very, very attractive valuations, where we felt we could reposition those assets, or honestly, wait until the leases rolled and just mark-to-market over a period of time. And that continues to be where we are focused in Washington, D.C. Interestingly, we have actually done a significant amount of pruning in D.C. over the time that we've been a public company as well. We sold 1301 New York Avenue last year. We've sold -- we're in joint venture with a significant number of our properties, so we sold the joint venture interest in Metropolitan Square when we did our 901 New York Avenue deal. We sold one of our major assets in the Southwest of the city 10 or 11 years ago.","Raymond A. Ritchey","The Marketing Center.","Douglas T. Linde","The Marketing Center [ph], which is in the suburb. So we continue to be thoughtful about the long-term opportunities to create value in D.C., as well as what the appropriate exit point is for particular assets.","Raymond A. Ritchey","I mean, we're underway right now, Jordan, as you know, with 601 Mass. That's a site that we controlled 5 years ago with a lease back from NPR, built their new headquarters. The project is 85% lease-free activity, doesn't deliver for another 15 months. the cash on cash return, that's going to be mid 8 unlevered when it's delivered. So while Washington continues to be challenged, at risk of sounding self-serving here, we have continued to outperform the market not only in Reston, but also downtown. And we're planning a really good defense on the 3 major renewals we have. We're very, very optimistic about our own chances of success of keeping all 3. So while Washington has had a little bit of dip in the last 2 or 3 years, and relative to barriers to entry, that pesky height limit keeps those buildings at 11 or 12 stories. So for us to deliver a $1 million square foot tower that you see in the other 3 markets, it takes $4 billion or $5 billion to meet that level of supply. So we're still bullish on D.C. and specifically very bullish on Boston Properties' position in that market.","Operator","And your last question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Manny here with Michael. Just thinking about -- you mentioned 2015 cash NOI growth. I was wondering what the spread between the cash and the GAAP may be given the burn-off of free rents and other things.","Michael E. LaBelle","There still is a GAAP, so we still do have free rent burning off in some of the same-store from some of the leasing that we've done. I don't want to describe right now what the amount of that GAAP is, but there still is some more in there. I do -- I would expect the same-store portfolio, the noncash rent to be lower in '15 than it was in '14, although we will have noncash rents in our development portfolio that actually will probably be higher than in '14. But if you just look at the same-store, it would be lower.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay. It's Owen Thomas. Let me just summarize by saying hopefully we've been able to demonstrate to you how busy we are at the current time given all the projects and activities going on.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thanks Arista, good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05, released 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancy is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year end due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 601 Gateway in South San Francisco.","We had solid rent rollup in our leasing activity with rental rate on leases that commenced in the first quarter up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to prior lease. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston all exhibited strong growth over the quarter. Our U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hands of slowdown, fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year, and estimates for this quarter are below 1%, however our most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revision.","The job's picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate are steady at 5%, labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office market nationally continuing to improve, net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter, vacancy rate remained essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year, but remain at 2% of total stock, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest space demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries, notwithstanding all the financial disruptions in the last nine months.","Moving to the financial markets, they\u2019ve improved materially from their lows in mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%, near-term interest rate increases also look less likely with the U.S. Federal Reserve highlighting concerns about sluggish growth, and other central banks around the world, most recently, the European Central Bank signaling an accommodative posture, 10 year U.S. treasury is hovering around 1.9% is traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads have narrowed, though less so for riskier credit.","Now moving to real estate, on private real estate \u2013 private markets real estate valuation, prices remained strong for prime assets in Gateway markets. And we\u2019ve seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarter and seen a number of transactions in our core markets that were offered and priced in 2016, examples of this include; in Boston 101 Seaport that\u2019s a new 440,000 square foot office building located in the Seaport District, a 100% leased to PWC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 a square foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund. In Washington DC, 733 10th Street, a fully leased 170,000 square foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, 1,065 square foot, I believe only the third building to trade above 1,000 per square foot in the district, the buyer was a Middle Eastern fund manager.","In New York, there are two significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yards, a new 1.8 million square foot office tower selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate is nearly $1,200 a square foot and 550 Madison Avenue, an 850,000 square foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion is trading for approximately $1,800 a square foot.","And lastly in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square foot older, but fully renovated Class A office building in the SoMa district leased at current market rents sold to a U.S. investor for approximately 4.8 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco.","As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for risker assets, whether in non-core locations and\/or acquiring lease-up for renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads, the treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuations. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income.","Now moving to our capital strategy, it remains unchanged and that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments than in stabilized acquisitions and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase, for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased 218,000 square foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in infilled location with increasing density, it\u2019s 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021.","During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately of 630,000 square foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we\u2019re paying $123 a square foot for un-entitled land, while receiving a 4.6% cash yield, as we entitle and prelease a new upsize office complex. We are also working on several additional acquisitions of sites and value-add office buildings.","On dispositions, in the first quarter as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of non-core assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.","Moving to development, we remain very active, primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential starts for the balance of 2016, it will remain highly dependent on securing preleasing for entitled sites. The potential starts for 2016 include Springfield Metro Center where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA, Reston Block 5 located in the Reston Town Center and 20 CityPoint, the mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham, these three projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet. We've been very active in this past quarter, advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016.","Several important updates are as follows; as mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year-end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlements were made available for our Kendall Center development. We are in advanced discussions with multiple office users to fully prelease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlements. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex, involving replacing two smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets.","You\u2019ve probably read about our initial submission to the City of Boston for the development of additional sites at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early phase and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017.","You have also probably read that we've been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue, between 44th and 45th Streets in New York. The site is the western half of a full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues, and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island Railroad station at Grand Central Terminal. We will acquire a 99 year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and ULURP. The development of this property is likely several years out, but we\u2019ve commenced our predevelopment work.","As discussed, we are also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. These redevelopment projects that we're executing include 399 Park, the low rise building at 601 Lex in New York, 1330 Connecticut Avenue, Metropolitan Square, and the Prudential Center retail. ","At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and one redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected cost. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our Company\u2019s growth over the next four years.","Moving for a moment to comment on governance, we recently announced in our proxy that Mort Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and become Chairman Emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our Board and Joel Klein will become our lead Independent Director. We were also very pleased to be able to recruit Karen Dykstra and Bruce Duncan as Independent Directors of our Board.","So, in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan that we\u2019ll improve and lease our existing assets, as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected non-core assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holding that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years.","Our balance sheet is strong with a net debt to EBITDA ratio below six times and with a substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedge. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in coming quarters.","Now let me turn it over to Doug for further review our markets.","Doug Linde","Thanks Owen, good morning everybody. The market color that I am going to give this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls, albeit there are few subtle changes, but I want to just sort of level status-quo what I\u2019ve said previously and I\u2019ll do that real quickly. So what we\u2019ve said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the pace that it was going at in 2014 and 2015, the Silicon Valley continues to be very active and actually has been expanding, New York is a good market, but it\u2019s been impacted by growing supply and there has been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand, the Washington DC is a challenged market and there is not much evidence of improvement, so the Reston area continues to be pretty active and there is a little bit of growth there, and Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand, while the CBD is a healthy market, but it\u2019s really been more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that sort of levels what I\u2019ve said previously.","Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Peterson Way was just purchased, give you some sense of the thesis around this state and our views of the Valley. So having sold innovation place last quarter, our portfolio unfortunately is pretty small down there. It\u2019s really comprise of our 5,700 square feet of Mountain View single storey product where we actually completed another 8,900 square foot of leases this quarter with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. And then we have our standalone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square foot and we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose, that\u2019s the totality of our portfolio down there.","The difficultly we\u2019ve been having over the last four-five years is finding high quality buildings or sites with an acceptable basis\/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 of square foot and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today.","So we have a market where there was 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015, the market size is about 240 million square feet, so it\u2019s a market we definitely want to be a part of and there was 11 million square feet of absorption in 2015. In the first quarter there were another eight leases over 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google and another 200,000 square feet from Apple, and those are clearly the two dominant users of space and they\u2019ve had a dramatic influence on the market, but there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook, NVIDIA, Broadcom and VMware and Palo Alto Networks, that are really leaders in their perspective fields, and these are growing companies and what they are looking for is new modern efficient product to house their growth. So this is what we are going to hopefully build and this is the demand that we are going to satisfy.","Jumping over to the city, as we discussed in our call in January, leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in 2014 and early 2015, and so that\u2019s been a continuation into the beginning of 2016.","I think the big difference between the market then i.e. in 2014 and 2015 and today is really the lack of large growth requirements, and by that I mean big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there is no 300,000 square foot greater requirement that we are tracking in the market. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, and Dropbox, and Salesforce.com, and Uber, and Stripe, and Slack, and LinkedIn, and they\u2019re just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand. And in the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet each, and just in April Lyft, and FitBit and Uber have combined leased over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually was from the sublet markets. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market, it\u2019s still expanding, it\u2019s not quite in the same manner that it was in 2014 and 2015. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the City of San Francisco.","The second change in the CBD market in San Francisco has been the velocity from startups. If you look at the venture investing statistics, the seed in early stage investing is down about 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year and first time investing is down 31%. And if you look at the city\u2018s sublet statistics, the overall level is very low at about 1.4 million square feet, but there are significant amount of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the South Financial and the SoMa areas. This is the product that\u2019s most attractive to the startup community.","Keep in mind that most sublet has limited term, so it\u2019s not competing with the lease expiration-driven requirement from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So at EC, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet of that 128,000, and net tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128,000. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last couple of quarters and is obviously a dramatic mark up in our same store statistics this quarter.","The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today at EC continues to be robust, a 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenants or expansions. We also have active discussions with new tenants for an additional four vacant floors totaling 100,000 square feet. So with very, very busier Embarcadero Center, I would say however that relevant to the end of 2015 when activity was described as its strongest it is ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit.","We\u2019ve signed additional leases for floor to Salesforce Tower, a 180,000 square feet which is in our statistics today, so our occupancy is 59% and the next wave lease proposals are progressing and include some single floor users, as well as large tenants between two and four floors. All of the discussions involve pending late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The steel in the core are rising into the San Francisco skylines, and we hope to have our first tenants and occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.","Now based on conversations we\u2019ve had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there has been a prevalence of concern about the next market I'm going to talk about which is Midtown Manhattan. Now our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014, when we recognized there was going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diverse industry group, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio that are expanding today. Some of the more recent transactions in the marketplace from an expansion perspective have included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Vox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Shroders, and Chubb. ","In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision making from small financial firms. And the first quarter was certainly a rollercoaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high end, which is predominantly a small financial services firm demand pool. Across the market in the first quarter, there were five relocation transactions written at starting rent over $100 of square foot and that includes the Citadel lease at 425 Park. So if you remove the Citadel transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet, so four leases 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter.","During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet, over 100,000 square feet of our demand had starting rents over a $100 of square foot. They were all renewals and explore expansions. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasings between $80 and $120 of square foot, the velocity above $125 of square foot have slowed. We\u2019ve been successful leasing small unit across the portfolio for a number of years and we are going to take a very similar approach for the two General Motors floors we get back on July 1st, subdividing them for smaller customers as required.","Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continue to be very, very active, given the magnitude of the commitment by the perspective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year. Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250, West 55th Street, and while we have not signed a lease on any of that place in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of food operators have presented proposals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that take back is stronger than we anticipated.","At 399 Park, we are in lease negotiations with two existing tenants that would expand and commit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in 2017, a 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. And we\u2019ve had some questions about the rollup and roll down of the office space that city is going to be leading in 2017, and our expectation is that it\u2019s going to be pretty moderate with very slight rollup. So as an example, we completed a four floor extension on one of the floors that is in question and the rollup was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e. pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a rollup of over 35% on a gross basis, so clearly 399 is one of the more moderate pieces of that.","Mike made some significant enhancements to our supplement package this quarter and he is going to discuss those, but the one I want to point out is the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington DC region, it illustrates what we\u2019ve been saying for some time which is that our Washington DC, CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company\u2019s NOI.","We\u2019ve seen a number of comments suggesting that the DC office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no demonstrable change in the leasing environment. Most of the DC law firms have completed their new installations, between 2016 and 2019, we are tracking only one law firm expiration over a 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there is likely to get little impact on any downsizing under market, the bad news is that they\u2019re selectively being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be a very \u2013 take a very measure approach to their renewals, it is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing our decisions.","In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete a 117,000 square foot lease at WeWork at Met Square this quarter, as well as get another 17,000 square feet of the uncommitted space at 601 Mass Avenue leased. This quarter we also completed a 60,000 square foot renewal in Reston Town Center, starting rents in the mid-50s and five smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased. ","One green shoot in the Washington DC and Northern Virginia marketplace comes from a group of midsize technology tenants that are slowly expanding. We have a few of the tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that Owen mentioned.","The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies, as well as for startup technology and maker organizations, this has led to a continual improvement and leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this quarter. Leasing velocity in the Waltham\/Lexington submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months, as a result of this type of demand and much of it is organic expansion. ","When we purchased Bay Colony in 2011, it was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenant and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost every one of them is in an expansion mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet in our suburban portfolio and we have responded to more than 500,000 square feet of additional proposals over the last months. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with a growth of the biotech industry and a tech tighten that are there, we have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active lease discussions as Owen described on 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site specific applications this year with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, as part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high rise product.","The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market and supply has been absorbed over the last few years, though there is some specular development going on in the seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants expanding into the overall market, much of the demand is still leased expiration driven. General Electric is going to be moving into a combination of new construction and rehab buildings currently owned by P&G and not utilizing existing inventory. ","This quarter, we completed over 520,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work that we did in 100 Federal Street, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon and 50,000 square feet at the Prudential Center. Activity at 120 St. James where we have 170,000 square feet of availability has picked up dramatically, and although we haven\u2019t signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their auctions at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet which will be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants would have occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.","Last quarter we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transaction this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th, we\u2019ve accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge.","And with I\u2019ll turn the floor over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. As Doug mentioned we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I\u2019d like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impact of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years.","In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we\u2019ve included supplemental information in our same property NOI performance pages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we\u2019ve historically provided, as well as the performance of our share of the portfolio. You will also note that we\u2019ve folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter due to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter.","Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we\u2019re embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider non-recurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure and the supplemental, we\u2019re now segregating the capital spend for these projects which have a total budget of approximately $165 million to be spent over the next few years.","Now turning to our results for the quarter, as you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share, about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million of this outperformance with about half of it coming from faster than projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are streamlined into our revenues upon lease signing. We also incurred earlier than projected occupancy from new leasing and smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower than projected operating expenses that stemmed from warmer than normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit, as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project will be incurred later this year.","On development and management services fee income, we were approximately $1 million ahead of our projections, the majority relates to higher than anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multiyear development fee for worth that commenced this quarter.","Our first quarter same property performance was solid, with the combined portfolio cash NOI up 5.6% and GAAP NOI up 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company's share of NOI growth differs from the combined results and if you pull out the non-controlling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% in 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading adjusted combined.","As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same property growth to moderate through the year. Our same property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015, but burned off during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI will be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 757 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue where we\u2019ve completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low-rise building starting later this year. We expect this portion of the building to be out of service for about two years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime, but in late 2018 when we reintroduce both the new retail and low-rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building.","Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally in line with our prior projections. Overall, we\u2019ve modestly increased our combined same property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, but we still project roughly breakeven growth from 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015. ","Again, when you remove the non-controlling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our GAAP NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for non-cash straight line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year.","We acquired Peterson Way this quarter with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime the building is a 100% leased for the next five years and it\u2019s projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we\u2019ve increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our non-same property portfolio that includes our new developments and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contributions from these developments and acquisitions for 2016 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI.","We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income.","That completes our formal remarks. I\u2019d appreciate if the operator would open up the lines for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. ","Emmanuel Korchman","Maybe if can we just stick to New York City for a second and we think about the Madison Avenue corridor, that sounds like it's going to have a bunch of new supply coming on if all these projects go forward over the next few years. Do you think that that submarket can handle the new supply coming from One Vanderbilt, if we classify it as Madison, MTA site, and now Sony coming back to office?","Doug Linde","So you just mentioned three projects, one of them is the existing building and the other two are new development. I can\u2019t comment on the timing of the One Vanderbilt, but I think that the MTA site is a site that will take some time to go through entitlement, and hopefully over time that the city of New York have a demand generator that allows us to start that building with a significant pre-leasing commitment associated with it. I think that the challenge with New York City, and I will let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying above $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchored tenants that would be paid over $100 a square foot in size. And so, I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to a hope that simply rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large scale tenant demand that the city currently sees. John, do you want to comment anymore?","John Powers","No, I think you have it Doug. On the Madison comment, as you said there is a big timing difference, 550 is vacant now, and the MTA site has to go through the whole Euler process, so their objective is to have that done when East site access comes, which is 2021, it\u2019s a long way from now.","Emmanuel Korchman","If we switch course for a second, given your positive commentary on Silicon Valley in Santa Clara specifically, can your express your interest or your views on the Yahoo site that seems to be coming to market?","Doug Linde","Bob, do you want to take that one.","Bob Pester","Yeah, it\u2019s a big site. They\u2019re looking for approximately $300 million, it\u2019s not a bad site. We think the site that we purchased is a smaller and more manageable and closer to the center of activity. The Yahoo site has been on the market for quite some time, so that will tell you how many buyers are out there for a $300 million site.","Emmanuel Korchman","I will take it that you\u2019re not a likely buyer there?","Bob Pester","No, I don\u2019t see there is a likely buyer at this time.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. ","John Kim","Your cash pre-leasing spreads at 26% was more than double what you achieved last year, would you characterize this as unusually high this quarter or a reflection of what you\u2019re seeing for the remaining of the year?","Doug Linde","So, the challenge with our pre-leasing spreads is that they\u2019re so dependent upon the particular portion of the portfolio that\u2019s rolling over at any one time. So we may have a quarter where we have much more significant growth and then we may have a quarter where we have a much more muted perspective because of the specifics associated with \u2013 again the granularity of that. In general, the dominant quarter is relative to its San Francisco rollover, the higher that numbers will be because on average there is \u2013 it is probably somewhere around 50% or 55% mark-to-market on virtually everything that we are doing in Embarcadero Centre, so as that gets a larger portion of each particular quarter that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it, and then I think the second area would be our New York portfolio at new General Motors building where we have significant embedded upside, so when those things rollover into the market you\u2019re going to see a much higher number and then our Cambridge portfolio where there is a significant embedded upside, those are the sort of three portions of the market, where when they hit the statistics in any one quarter they will push it in the right direction.","John Kim ","So outside of those buildings there would be more of a 10% to 15% number?","Doug Linde","I wish I could give you specific number, I just can\u2019t because it\u2019s really dependent upon the granularity, there is not much in the way of roll up on our CBD portfolio. So if 100% of that was occurring in anyone typical quarter it will be more muted.","John Kim ","Okay. And then can I ask you about 767 Fifth Avenue, more on the re-financing side with a fair amount of debt due next year. I know you swapped \u2013 swap rates are part of it earlier this year, but can you talk about the overall financing strategy next year and if you\u2019re planning to utilize similar amount of debt of the mortgage mezzanine debt?","Doug Linde","I mean, I think that the amount of debt we will be able to get will be at least equal to what is there and it will all be senior. We won\u2019t need the used mezzanine debt to get to that level. The cash flow that property has grown pretty dramatically over the last 10 years that we owned it, as we\u2019ve rolled up rents pretty consistently over that timeframe and there is still \u2013 it\u2019s still under rented from a lease rate perspective. So from a debt underwriting perspective, lenders will be comfortable with the cash flow characteristics and the future cash flow characteristics, it\u2019s obviously a large loan. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge with it, is that the current financing is $1.6 billion, it\u2019s naturally going to be good for the CMBS market, CMBS market can easily handle a loan of that size typically, but that market has been a little more volatile over the last six to nine months. ","Although I would say that most of the volatility is when you start to get into the higher leverage points, so when you\u2019re talking about a loan that is 40% to 50% leverage, that market is more -- is a better place to be today than if you\u2019re talking about a loan that is 60% to 65% leverage. So we could finance this loan today in the CMBS market based upon the leverage point that we have. The existing loan is indicative of bunch of banks and insurance companies, so it\u2019s also possible to execute in that type of environment where you would have somebody help you put together a large syndicate. So I think there is a couple of different ways for us to tackle this, it doesn\u2019t expire until the end of 2017, so obviously there is time, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve put in some hedges for about a third of the exposure at this point. So that\u2019s kind of where I see that standing.","John Kim ","And can you remind us what the on cost of that is versus where you think you could refinance it?","Doug Linde","So that debt on a cash basis is 6% debt. On a GAAP basis because of the \u2013 when we consolidated this thing the GAAP debt is about 3%. I would say the CMBS market today for 50% financing is somewhere in the high 3s to 4.25, and as you go leverage say towards 60% and kind of get into that 4.5 level, so that\u2019s a significant reduction I would see from a cash interest basis based upon current interest rates.","John Kim ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Good morning. I guess to start, can you talk about leasing prospects for 888 Boylston, which is coming online in the third quarter.","Doug Linde","Sure, so the 888 Boylston Street is a 17 storey building and floors three through 11, and floors 15, 16, and 17 are already committed and leased, and so we have four floors left and I think we have strong interest in the building from anyone who comes to the building and looks at it because the design and development group here have created a building that is paramount to the most sustainable, exciting, innovative building that the City of Boston has ever seen. And the issue is that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re looking for premium rent, and so the number of tenants that are prepared to pay a premium rent is a smaller number than the average of the marketplace, and so we have to be patient with regards to the progress that we\u2019re going to make at least in that space, as what our expectations are.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And in terms of the on 2016 guidance, I guess there is none \u2013 2017?","Doug Linde","Yeah. The large tenants in the building are coming into the building from a rent commencement in 2017, I think there is about 75,000 square feet that could hit the fourth quarter with the top three floors.","Mike LaBelle","That\u2019s already in our guidance and I think it\u2019s a 25 that\u2019s in 2016, and then a couple of those other floors are in the beginning of 2017, and then the anchor tenant is towards the end of 2017.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Then I appreciate the color on San Francisco and the Bay Area. Can you guys talk a little more about supply, like how you guys are thinking about the competitive supply both in San Francisco and in the Valley?","Doug Linde","Bob, you want to take that one?","Bob Pester","Yeah, in San Francisco, I mean, right now in addition to Salesforce Tower there is the 181 Fremont project in Block 5, which is under construction. I don\u2019t see anything else coming out of the ground that\u2019s entitled in the Central SoMa district or the SoMa district or the Downtown any time soon, so that\u2019s the main competition that we have. Mission Bay does have the Kilroy project that's under construction. But we really don\u2019t think that anyone that\u2019s going to be looking at that project is going to be looking at our project at Salesforce Tower.","And then down in Valley, there is numerous projects that are under construction and planned several million square feet and we think that will offer opportunities for tenants to expand in and temper the vacancy rate somewhat from a standpoint of possibly increasing. But in San Francisco overall there is the very little competition that\u2019s going to come into play in Prop M, obviously is going to have an impact on future development because there is nothing that\u2019s being resolved on Prop in one way or another and I don\u2019t see anything getting resolved on it in the near future.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. But I guess going back to the comments about not that many large tenants looking for space right now, how do you think about some of the buildings that are under construction in the CBD, that space going \u2013 that space getting leased? Do you think they will sit for a while or we'll see that stuff get leased up pretty quickly once it's done?","Doug Linde","We\u2019ve heard there is a couple of Silicon Valley users that have looked at Block 5, they have a no commitment. 181 is a smaller \u2013 a much smaller floor plate building, so whether that appeals the tech remains to be seen. I can only talk from the standpoint of the activity that we\u2019re seeing at Salesforce Tower and we continue to do tours weekly and presentations weekly and we continue to exchange paper proposals within it, you know we hope in the next \u2013 by the next quarterly call that we\u2019ll have done hopefully another 100,000 square feet in leases.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Then finally for Mike LaBelle, can you just talk about what the new guidance means for AFFO and dividend coverage for the year?","Mike LaBelle","So yeah, I\u2019m happy to, you know our AFFO is going to be better than it was last year where we had a lot of pre-rent. So pre-rent last year was a well over $100 million, so this year\u2019s pre-rent guidance is $40 million to $55 million, so that\u2019s going to be a benefit to it. I mean I would say on a per share basis, the way we calculate FAD in our supplemental, we expect it to be similar in the $415 million to $440 million range. You\u2019re talking \u2013 in order to meet our occupancy guidance that we\u2019re going to have leasing cost of somewhere in the $150 million range, and CapEx of \u2013 on a recurring CapEx basis, somewhere $75 million to $90 million, which is pretty similar to last year, maybe a little bit higher.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan ","Morning, guys. You mentioned seeing a slowdown in high-end tenant demand in New York City this past quarter. Just with some of the market volatility settling down in the past couple months, are you seeing signs of those types of tenants getting more active again?","Doug Linde","I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let John comment. So I actually \u2013 I talked to a handful of brokers in the third week in January, and then I talked to them again last week. And I think to describe their personality is somewhat manic, on the good and the bad. And the number of tours that is occurring right now in the greater Midtown small tenant market is significantly accelerated versus where it was when the Dow and the credit markets were a little bit more in turmoil. John, do you have any other perspective?","John Powers","No, I mentioned on the last call that we had this in August and the beginning of September when the equity markets had a lot of jitters and spread and widened in the bond market. And we had the same thing happen in January, but it didn\u2019t stick with leasing market in the fall and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stick with the leasing market now. Certainly on the high-end financial hedge funds et cetera, they\u2019re very, very close to that market and when there is issues there they have concerns.","Jed Reagan ","Okay. That's helpful. Just switching to DC, can you talk about your outlook for DC beyond 2016 as far as leasing activity and rent growth is concerned? Do you think that's a market that turns the corner in a noticeable way in 2017 and 2018, let's say, following the election?","Doug Linde","I will take a crack at it and then Peter can add to it. Well we lack in DC that you hear in the other markets are kind of unexpected demand drivers. Right now, we\u2019re still pre-dominantly lease expiration driven market, so we\u2019re going to look in advance and see where the demand is coming from, from existing tenants and thus match up relative supplies, is pretty equal. We\u2019re not going to see a tremendous increase in vacancy, nor are we going to see a tightness, it\u2019s a pretty balanced picture right now, but what we really need is for the election to take place, clear the slate and look at some technology and some other demand drivers coming to the marketplace. Until that additional demand comes, we\u2019re going to be pretty status-quo market. Peter, do you have anything to add. ","Peter Johnston","I would certainly say, that\u2019s true, it relates to the election. I do think looking at the job growth numbers and looking at where the GSA has been, they\u2019ve been shedding that jobs and that has stabilized in the last 12 months and they\u2019re actually starting to add jobs again, which I think will be a positive, but as is always the case, the money won\u2019t start to flow till after the election for those things.","Jed Reagan ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","I guess Owen or Doug, just more generally, you guys talked about the development pipeline; but can you just talk more about where you think we are in the cycle, and how that pertains to the shadow development pipeline? Has your level of comfort going ahead with any of those projects changed as we've come through the cycle? And how do you think about the importance of pre-leasing at this point?","Owen Thomas","I don\u2019t it\u2019s changed, but I do think it is shifting gradually. In terms of your question about the cycle obviously it\u2019s difficult for us to predict exactly when the cycle will end and when we\u2019ll have the next recession, there are number of people predicting it, in the near term, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite as concerned about a near term recession, but as I mentioned in my remarks growth is clearly slow and I think we anticipate that by continuing here for some period of time. But we\u2019re not blind to the prospects of a recession in the \u2013 certainly in the medium term. And then, what I mean by saying a shift, I do think our thinking about launching new development is shifting. I think our pre-let requirement is higher, it\u2019s difficult for us to say precisely that we need x percent for a building pre-let to launch it because it depends a lot on other factors, like where is the tenant coming from, what\u2019s the size of the building, what\u2019s the nature of the market at the time, so we don\u2019t set those kinds of fixed hurdles. But I do think as we look at our portfolio and we look at projects that we want to launch a pre-let requirement is clearly required and I mentioned in my remark three projects that we\u2019re looking at now for 2016, and we\u2019re not going to launch any of them without some kind of significant pre-let.","Blaine Heck","Okay, that's helpful. Then it sounds like you guys are progressing well with the tenant for the FAO space. Can you give any estimate as to the potential NOI upside versus the temporary tenant that you have there, and maybe even versus what FAO was paying?","Owen Thomas","We\u2019ve been reticent to talk about the specific economics of the deal. We\u2019ve talked in sort of big picture perspective about the income that\u2019s been generated by the overall resale space in the past at the General Motors building. I think we\u2019ve said in the past and if you could figure it out from our disclosure that the rent that FAO is paying was about $20 million a years and we think the number is significantly higher than that.","Blaine Heck","Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Doug or Owen, when we look at your occupancy by market, there is a real bifurcation in a couple places between the CBDs and the suburban\u2019s. And I am just wondering if you could sort of comment on Princeton, you know it's 75% occupied today versus your New York, which is 95%. You've obviously got a few things you talked about down in South San Francisco that may get cleared up. But then when you look at the Washington portfolio, you're doing well in DC, specifically in Reston, but then suburban Maryland. How do you think about those markets in particular? And maybe Ray can comment on the Annapolis Junction, which just doesn't seem to be getting much traction on the leasing front?","Doug Linde","Sure. Let me take a quick stab at that, Steve, because it\u2019s a fair question. So the good news is that the occupancy number you're describing and the contribution from the properties that the occupancy number is significantly underweighted. In other words, if it were leased, it\u2019s the relative rent that it would achieve is de minimus relative to the rents that we are achieving in our CBD property. So as an example, the Washington DC vacancy is in our VA 95 product, and it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s actually the first time in the 20 some odd years that we\u2019ve been a public company we\u2019ve had significant availability in that particular park, but the net rents that we are achieving here are $13 a square foot. The big pieces of availability in our portfolio are at Tower Center in New Brunswick, which is an excess of 300,000 square feet of that availability and then the property in South San Francisco at Gateway. So if you pull those three out, the VA 95, the Gateway and the Tower Center, we have a very different picture, but it is true that the majority of our challenge space is in the suburban marketplace.","Steve Sakwa","Yeah. I guess, Doug, it just seems like it takes a lot of management effort for maybe not a lot of reward. And I guess is it worth longer-term keeping it versus focusing your efforts on other things in the portfolio?","Owen Thomas","So Steve, it\u2019s a great point. Just to debate we constantly have as a management team. And I described a lot of investor\u2019s enthusiasm for real estate, but it\u2019s primarily for lease buildings in our core markets and there is less investor enthusiasm for unleased buildings in suburban market. So, our tradeoff is \u2013 we don\u2019t want to sell assets just to sell them at deeply discounted prices. We want to perform the real estate skill, lease the buildings, and get a proper price for them. And I would say if you go back and look at the asset sales that we\u2019ve done, clearly we\u2019ve done some of the large joint ventures on the urban assets, but mixed in with that, if you go back over the last couple of years, we have sold non-core assets in some of our suburban locations in Boston and in Washington DC. And also as Doug said, one of the things I just want to clarify when you talked about the Princeton vacancy, the Carnegie vacancy is \u2013 the Carnegie occupancy is 86% of all resident in that Tower Center as Doug described.","Steve Sakwa","And I guess, any comment from Ray on just the Annapolis Junction? That just doesn't seem to be getting a lot of traction at this point.","Ray Ritchey","I\u2019ll be glad to take a crack at that, Steve. First of all, again, we only own 50% of those buildings with our partners the Goulds, and we are seeing the NSA demand be focused more back on the base as oppose to reaching out to satellite office location. And the MegaCenter which was the main driver for the Annapolis Junction project, they changes the use of that that was like a \u2013 it was like WeWork for spies. It was a scenario where people would come in and have temporary occupancy. Those requirements are also getting moved back on the base. So we are seeing a slowdown in the demand, but again our presence there is relatively small on a relative basis to the overall Boston Properties Enterprise.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess just one last question for Bob Pester. I know this is hard. You say there is not a lot of large requirements in the marketplace today, but what we've heard from brokers in the past is a lot of these large requirements are stealthfully done, maybe either away from the brokerage firm or directly with some landlords. Any perspective you can just sort of offer on that today? I realize if they're not on a brokerage list and maybe they're not in the market or you would know about them, but how should we think about that?","Bob Pester","Yeah, I think that's a bunch of baloney, Steve. We haven\u2019t seen after the years we\u2019ve been in this marketplace where some mega deal happens that nobody knew about.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Aslakson with Stifel.","Erin Aslakson","Good morning. So yeah, my question was kind of along the same lines, just regarding the Annapolis Junction asset. I realize it's 50% owned, but it had a huge loan-to-value in place, $339 a square foot. That we assume is being relocated on base. Is that what you were referring to, Ray?","Ray Ritchey","Yeah, basically, Erin, they seemed to be concerned about security now more than ever. So the outreach to \u2013 again, third-party space providers is not as great as it was before. We still have a strong presence there. We are pretty well occupied in the other buildings of the MegaCenter and Mike wants to talk about the debt, you can go ahead and ask questions to him.","Erin Aslakson","Okay, that's fine. Then that was on AJ One, where the big debt was in place. On AJ Seven, there was a one year extension done on the loan there, which is much more reasonable, $170 a square foot. But is there a lack of demand? I mean, that's a 100% leased asset, but is there some expectation that that tenancy goes away as well?","Mike LaBelle","Was a short-term lease, and no, there is no anticipated vacancy. We just decided to stay short and kind of evaluate the overall positions as we go forward. That lease is actually \u2013 as Ray correctly stated to one year lease. However, the government invested about $40 million in technology and that building and for better or worse the nature of that Park, those one year leases are just the way they get allocated funding. So what they do is basically give you a one year deal and then nine one-year extensions. So we have every expectation that they are going to stay in that space.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. And then how much did the government invest in the One Annapolis Junction asset?","Mike LaBelle","Actually we put the bulk of that investment in, and as Ray described it really was a plug-in play skiff with raised flooring all the way down to the desktop, computers and a 24 hour operating entity in there which was first SAIC and is now Leidos one of their successful entities with staff, help desk, 24x7. And as Ray indicated, what happened \u2013 having met with the director of logistics and facilities early in this part of the year \u2013 earlier this year rather, they\u2019ve had a couple of security issues up there. There was a fidelity outside the base. There was obviously the Edward Snowden incident, and it has \u2013 I think scared them into moving certain requirements on base when they\u2019ve been able to do that. We are in the process now with Leidos of throttling back, based on our conversations with the logistics folks from NSA. The level of services that we\u2019ve been providing to a number that we can adjust the rent downward and take that part of the operating expense if you will. So where we\u2019ve been leasing space there in the $120 to $130 range, we just did a deal at $95, which quite frankly if can continue to do deals with that rate, I think we can put the building back on a pretty sound footing.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. Is there any indication in the size of the amount of square footage going back on base in total?","Mike LaBelle","They didn\u2019t really share that. They didn\u2019t really share that information with us.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. Well, thank you, guys, very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Good morning, everyone. Just going back to San Francisco here for a second, I know we've talked about it quite a bit, but just curious. It does look like you got some leasing done at Salesforce Tower. Can you just comment on \u2013 and I think you said that you\u2019re hoping for another 100,000 square foot or so in the next couple of quarters. Just curious who is taking space there today? Obviously, the larger guys are not out there, but where is the demand coming from today?","Owen Thomas","We\u2019ve talked about this in the past and it hasn\u2019t changed, but I want to just reiterate that. So all of the demand that we are seeing at Salesforce Tower is really lease expiration driven demand. I mean there maybe a couple of tenants that are in the market for a floor that have asked for a presentation, but it is a truly representative FIRREA-oriented group of tenants that are looking for high quality brand new visible state-of-the-art office space. So its brokerage firms, consulting firms, accounting firms, lawyers, investment professionals, asset managers, venture capitalists. That's sort of the laundry list of the type of users who are the most likely tenants to be in that building. Remember the first available floor is now 32, and so, you know, you're in the high-rise of high-rise office building in the clinical location in San Francisco.","Vincent Chao","Okay; thanks for that. And then just maybe going back to the East Coast, just any comment you can provide on the Penn Station redevelopment, your interest and maybe the process from here?","John Powers","We\u2019re not bidding on the Penn Station redevelopment. We looked at it carefully, there is two opportunities, one is Penn Station and the other is the Fairway Building. It\u2019s very complex, both of them are very complex. Penn is primarily exclusively a retail play and Fairway has a combination of retail, probably some hotel and office, but it\u2019s very complex. And as I said, we analyzed carefully and decided not to participate.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alex Goldfarb","Good morning and thank you. Just two questions here. First, you guys obviously spoke a lot about Midtown and what's going on, and then also the growth out West. But looking at your portfolio mix, New York is still a pretty big component of BXP relative to the West Coast. And if we look at where a lot of the economic growth is, there seems to be a lot more coming out of the Bay Area versus New York. So should we expect more and more of the investment to be out West? Or should we expect it to be as it's been right now, where there is a West Coast investment announcement and at the same time you have a New York investment announcement as well?","Owen Thomas","So Alex, we certainly think about our portfolio mix and our balance across the various regions as we think about making new investments and buildings or in developments. And for that reason if you pro-forma-ed what we\u2019re going to look like over the next few years, the San Francisco component of our overall results is going to grow materially, primarily driven by the sale \u2013 the delivery of the Salesforce Tower, but also by some of the other project that we delivered last year like 680, 690, 535 mission and so forth. So there has been a conscious effort and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a conscious effort that we're going grow our company is areas where there is the greatest tenant demand, which today is technology and life sciences. So, the answer to your question is, yes, but I would also say that the investment that we make are also opportunity driven. So, you know, our team in each of the regions work vigorously on identifying new investments, switching our development pipelines forward. And so that we think about a top-down the actual allocation are also driven by where the opportunity is opportunities present themselves.","Doug Linde","I mean, Alex, just if you take Salesforce Tower rate, it\u2019s 1.4 million square feet and if average gross rent in there is in the mid-80s, we are talking about $150 and $120 million of additional revenue, which is a significant jump in the overall percentage that San Francisco will have when the building is fully in service in 2018 or early 2019. I also think that \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our description of this, which is we're a demand oriented company. We are looking to serve those users who are growing and where the demand is been generated. And to the extent that there is more demand and users that are sort of technology oriented and it happen to be in the West Coast. We\u2019re going to see everything we possibly can to service those companies. On other hand, New York City and the Boston and the Cambridge marketplace is in to some degree Northern Virginia also have a pretty interesting feature demand pool that we are going to try and serve as best we can as well. And so I think that we are going to be aggressive about making investments in all of those places where we think there is an opportunity there to find tenants who are growing and we are looking for high quality office space.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, I think in your opening comments you said the activity down in Silicon Valley area is much more active than in San Francisco, did I hear correctly?","Doug Linde","Yeah, I mean if you look at the activity in the Silicon Valley in 2015, the work what went on in San Francisco.","Alex Goldfarb ","Okay. Then my question is, how much of that is just where businesses are growing because of what's happening internally in the business versus there may be easier access to, quote-unquote, cheaper, more affordable housing that's causing people to maybe \u2013 down South maybe there's San Jose or South of there, there's more affordable housing for people versus the explosive residential rent growth that's been in San Francisco. So how much of it has been employee driven versus business driven?","Doug Linde","So, I will make a few comments and then I will let Bob and Owen chime in. So, the first is that, Google and Apple are by far the most dominant users of office space in the Silicon Valley. And their headquarters is in the Silicon Valley and I think there\u2019s absolutely no expectation that whether that\u2019s going to change. I also think that, the number of people who are living in the city of San Francisco and that are using commuter oriented transit, mostly in the form of private buses to get to those campuses down in the Silicon Valley is very, very significant. And so I think that the value of the affordable housing is less critical to the growth of the Silicon Valley than the natural establishment of those campuses and those businesses in terms of historically where they have been and their ability to still be able to attract labor from the urban market, if they\u2019re looking for younger and more transit oriented types of opportunities. Bob, any other thoughts?","Bob Pester","Yeah, I\u2019ll just add, I think the housing prices in the Silicon Valley have anything to do with the growth, I think all the growth is organic growth where they\u2019re growing and getting bigger. If they were looking about residential values they would move to the East Bay, because that\u2019s the cheapest housing in the Bay area.","Alex Goldfarb ","That's one heck of a commute. Listen, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick"," Good morning; thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, I understand it's a relatively small segment of your overall business, but it looks like the multifamily and hotel segment has been dragging on same-store NOI the last little bit here. What's your prognosis for that segment going forward?","Mike LaBelle","I think on the same-store side our hotel was down a little bit that drove it this quarter. The challenge is, it\u2019s such a small portfolio that any kind of little change has an impact and also if you look at the residential page of our supplemental, the avenue is in one year and not in the other, so you really have to look at the same-store days, which is not as \u2013 it\u2019s not as bad because that excludes the avenue, which was sold during the year.","The Avant and the Atlantic Wharf property, retro-wharf, have both stayed very, very well occupied year to year and continue to improve.","Doug Linde","And I would also just add, we are interested in continuing to grow our residential portfolio, primarily through development. And if you look at our active pipeline and our pre-development pipeline, we have a number of projects that we anticipate, under construction now where we anticipate building, we talked a little about Reston, certainly in Cambridge, North Station; there are several examples to this around the company.","Tom Lesnick","Got it, thanks. Then maybe one for Ray. It looks like you guys are introducing paid parking at Reston Town Center. Just wondering; is it possible for you to quantify the incremental revenue opportunity there? And are there any other opportunities across the entire portfolio where you could also realize upside potential?","Ray Ritchey","I\u2019ll let Peter address that he\u2019s away more political than I on those type of investments, so go ahead Peter.","Peter Johnston","Well, I don\u2019t think we want to get into necessarily quantifying it, I would say that there is approximately 8,000 parking spaces there. We undertook for a couple of reasons, obviously revenue is one, but we\u2019ve got a circumstance where we have to control to honor our obligations with both the retailers and the office tenants there, and people in adjacent resident parking in our space is so to speak, as well as commuter is doing the same thing. And part of implementing it now is we\u2019ve got enough runway that with the introduction of Metro proximate to Town Center probably in about three, three and a half years. We want to be in a position where this system is up and running. It\u2019s going to be a licensed plate recognition system, you\u2019ll be using an app to park there and we think it\u2019s going to be a pretty significant enhancement for our customer base coming to the Town Center.","Doug Linde","One point I would like to make is we talked to some other major retailers about the experience of implementing paid parking and after the fact they actually noted an increase in sales of up to 10% of the retailers because the people who do come to the malls now find it way more convenient and as a result spend more time there and spend more dollars. So we view it as a great thing for our retailers and our office tenants and the income we get will certainly be helpful, but by no means the main driver.","Tom Lesnick","Interesting, I appreciate the insight. That's all I've got.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Thanks, guys. Just curious, going back to San Francisco, your commentary on it being a little bit slower. Just curious if that's filtered in, impact at all, rent level discussions as you're trying to fill up the rest of Salesforce?","Doug Linde","It actually hasn\u2019t, the overall availability in San Francisco I think is under 6% right now. And I think what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to price all of our product appropriately for the market, we are not striding to set record for the sake of setting records, where we think we are hitting the market bid and we are doing it pretty consistently because we\u2019re acting a true, honest market price that both the tenant and the landlord feel good about. And so we\u2019ve not seen any diminishing in our pricing component of our concession package and rental rate economics over the past three to four months.","Craig Mailman","That's helpful. Then just lastly, down at Peterson Way, I know it's a longer fuse on this one, but would this be spec or build-to-suit? ","Doug Linde","I would hope that it will be build-to-suit, but in 2023 we\u2019ll be in a different environment, so we\u2019ll see where we are when we get there.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thank you. ","Owen Thomas","So that concludes the questions and our formal remarks. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Boston Properties.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. We are still in a rather weak overall economic environment, an environment that we have been sort of anticipating and being concerned about for the better part of the last 5 years. I'm going to just indicate the number that has continued to be the one that is most distressing, which is the employment numbers or more specifically, the unemployment numbers, which the unemployment rate climbed up to 8.3% from 8.2%. But the other measure of the job market, which includes people who have only part-time work when they would like -- they're called involuntary part-time workers, that's at 15% and the only reason why the numbers went up in the last month is because the Bureau of Labor Statistics added 377,000 jobs on the basis of seasonal adjustment, the largest such adjustment in July over the past decade. So these numbers in a sense still leave us with some degree of concern over the general direction of the economy. But in that context, I must say that Boston Properties had a very, very good quarter, and I think that we are very comfortable with our anticipation of the way the business is going to go for the next while.","Just to give you some of the highlights, our operations, the FFO or funds from operation, for the quarter which just ended was $1.38 or $206.8 million compared to $1.37 -- pardon me, $1.24 for the comparable quarter of last year. And the net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $119.1 million compared to $60.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. And the net income available on an EPS basis was $0.79 compared to $0.41 for the second quarter of 2011. So we've had a very strong quarter. And that was due to a whole number of things. I'm just going to highlight a couple of major events, then I'm going to ask Doug to give a much more comprehensive view of it. But I'd like to mention the fact that we did complete a public offering of $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. They were 10.5 years and the interest rate was 3.85% with all-in costs, if you include financing fees, goes to 3.95% to maturity. So we are very -- frankly, we are proud to have such a very good reception in the bond market and on such solid terms. We have in mind, of course, investment of those funds in additional assets, either development assets or acquisition. We, for example, did have an agreement now to basically involve ourselves in a joint venture in something called Fountain Square in Reston, Virginia, which is an approximately 811,000 net rentable square foot office and retail complex. What is critical for us is it's adjacent to the company's other critical Reston property. This will actually be a two-stage venture in which the joint venture partner will contribute property valued at approximately $385 million and related mortgage indebtedness for a 50% joint venture -- or in the joint venture, rather. We will contribute about $87 million in cash for our 50% interest, which will be distributed to the joint venture partner and we'll be able to consolidate this joint venture. But we also will have the right to acquire the partner's 50% interest as they will have the right to force us to acquire that interest on January 4, 2016, at a fixed price, totaling approximately $102 million in cash. This is a project that we believe will not only be a wonderful project standing on its own, but will really reinforce and enhance a large commitment and investment in that whole Reston complex.","Doug Linde did a terrific job in making this an off-market transaction because of the relationship that he and Boston Properties have had with Beacon for a long period of time. And I think it just describes and reflects the kind of confidence that we have been able to generate within the industry and within the financial community.","Looking forward, we still think that we are in the best market, in the markets that still have done relatively well in a very weak economic environment. And we are constantly on the lookout for additional assets to develop and acquire. We're very cautious under these current economic conditions, but we are not so cautious that we don't think that they will be in a very sort of flexible or shall we say unpredictable economic environment. Nobody is quite sure where it's going to go because we are in an unprecedented kind of macroeconomic environment, which is now described as the great recession. It is a very long-standing recession that has really reflected a huge deleveraging, A, on the part of the consumer and the part of the public in large part because of what's happened in the housing growth. The average family has lost over 40% of their net worth from 2007 until today, which is a stunning collapse of the household net worth and it's going to have a big effect on the economy going forward. And frankly, nobody knows exactly how this is going to work out. We've had the biggest or the most stimulative fiscal and monetary policy in our history, and here we are, 3 or 4 years later, and we've run up deficits of close to $5 trillion and it has not taken the economy out of the very weak status. It's still in many ways declining and not growing and nobody is quite sure what to do or how to do it. And the other part of it is that we are in a time of political gridlock and governmental dysfunction, which doesn't help business confidence and there's a lot of hostility to the business community that is an attempt on the other part of politicians to channel the anger in the country over the economy to the business world instead of to the people who are running the country at the governmental level, both at the congressional level and at the national level.","So we still feel we will have some good activity going forward. We are, as I said, on the lookout and because we have both credibility and financial strength to make additional acquisitions, we're looking for those opportunities. They're not going to be easy to come by, but over time, they generally do. We have 1 or 2 other projects, which we believe we might very well tie up within the next short while, and we will be on the lookout for additional growth opportunities. And in the meantime, we are working very hard to lease up our space, and frankly, have done very well, by and large, in that process. When you think of how this whole economy is being affected by the fundamental economic trends, we feel very comfortable about the progress we have made and the progress we think we will continue to make.","With that, I will ask Doug to come in and fill in everything that you might want to know about, and I thank you for your attention.","Douglas T. Linde","Good morning, everybody. Thanks, Mort. So I thought I'd just sort of start off this morning and just sort of take a real macro perspective real quickly just to sort of reiterate some of the things that Mort not only said today but has been saying over the, I guess, the last 5 years, which is sort of shocking to me.","We keep talking about unemployment, and last summer, we were talking about the U.S. debt ceiling and the deficit reduction issues, and gosh, for the better part of 3 or 4 years, we've been talking about European sovereign, balance sheet solvencies and the banking system, and now we have this national election. And I think the most telling thing is that time really hasn't yielded much in the way of discernible improvement. So this is the environment that we feel like we're going to be in for a period of time.","And as we talk about what our portfolio is doing, I think you should gain some comfort that we are in a rather challenging economic backdrop doing as well as we are doing it. But I think there are reasons why we're doing well, and I hope that we're going to be able to demonstrate and continue to show the progress that we have shown since back quite frankly in 2008 when this whole disaster started from a financial perspective.","I think the one thing that's a little bit different than where we were a year ago is that last year, when we were talking, we were still pretty ebullient about the corporate American business improvements and top line sale increases and margin improvements, and I think it's fair to say that, that amount of air in the system has started to leak out and top line sales are coming down and margins probably don't have much in the way to go up. And I think that we are, while we're seeing great balance sheets, we still don't see much in the way of a large-scale macro across-the-board business hiring, which obviously is going to be the most critical thing to our business which is the office leasing business and we need bodies to occupy space.","The growth in our markets, which are thankfully characterized by supply limitations, have really been driven by increases in demand from the technology in the life science users, but they have been offset by employment reductions and productivity enhancements with regards to the use of space coming from what we refer to as the traditional financial services and professional services firms.","And when I use the word technology, it's somewhat broad, but it includes industries like software and the hardware industry, but also now digital content and social media, e-commerce, mobile applications, digital marketing and cyber security. That's -- the technology world is starting to feel bigger and involve more and more people.","New enterprises are being formed and one of the things that we like to watch every quarter is the flow of capital running into the venture businesses, just to sort of get a sense of new business formation on a small scale. And it's interesting, venture investing has been running at a level of between $6 billion and $8 billion per quarter for the last year or so. Just to give you a perspective of how that is relative to where it was at its height. Back in 2000, there was $22 billion per quarter. That was the height of the telecom, the dot-com world. So we're -- we've got a ways to go, but it's been pretty consistent. And not surprisingly, the Silicon Valley in San Francisco, Boston and New York City are the places that are winning the share of those investments. In fact, if you look at San Francisco, more than 70% of the transactions in the San Francisco CBD this year have been technology related and technology companies now occupy 20% of the CBD market. That's both north of market, south of market and sort of the other areas that have -- that has been popping up.","The strongest market in the Boston area is Cambridge. And we now have 6 new buildings under construction totaling almost 1.8 million square feet for growing life science organizations. The Boston CBD is starting to experience some migration of tech companies into traditional financial services-centric assets. So we had PayPal this quarter recently commit to International Place. That's one of the large towers that's on the greenway, and they joined Brightcove and Communispace, which have located recently at Atlantic Wharf, which is our project that we're -- in the financial area.","For technology companies and entrepreneurs, it's finding capable talent that really has become critical. And New York City, which is so desirable for its quality of life especially for a young workforce, has really become a great place to find employees and is really seeing a shift in the makeup of its workforce. Engineers and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have all really become a very important element in the New York City business community. And at the same time all this is happening, we are seeing businesses become much more efficient users of office space. So as leases expire, professional service and financial firms are downsizing their footprint, not necessarily their headcounts, interestingly, but they are downsizing their footprints.","And the market is getting additional supply, which obviously is serving to dampen any recovery. We've been discussing this for a number of quarters, so every time a law firm renews its lease, it's probably reducing its square footage by 15% or more, and it's also similarly occurring with some of the large financial institutions that are restructuring and downsizing their businesses as a result of the new regulatory environment, and I think there is in fact in some industries a real reduction in headcount as well, the financial services industry being the most significant example of that.","But productivity enhancements are nothing new. I mean, it's always happening, it's always going on. We actually embrace it. And with the way we design our space is important as we think about that. And we think it actually is going to result in companies having the financial capacity to upgrade their premises and look for better located, more desirable real estate, which again, fits right into our sweet spot.","We can't minimize enough that in a low-growth environment, Boston Properties really can increase its market share, its revenue and its cash flows. During our Investor Day last fall, we did a case study on Reston Town Center and we sort of described our success in the face of a 25% availability rate on the Toll Road market, where not only do we dramatically outperform the market from an occupancy perspective, today I think we're at 95%, but we've been able to create this environment where tenants are really willing to pay a dramatic premium versus the market for commodity office space. And as Mort said, with our pending purchase of Fountain Square in the Reston urban core, which we're going to talk about a little more detail in a few minute, we really hope to expand our success in this rather unique market.","Overall leasing activity across the markets during the second quarter was pretty sluggish, and I'm talking about the markets, not Boston Properties. And as we move into the summer, it's been basically the same. But in spite of a slowing market, we had an incredible great, great quarter with approximately 1.5 million square feet of transactions, which is way above our historical average over the last 7 years.","Our second-generation statistics were right in line with our expectations. The rolldown in San Francisco is very much what we expected and we have offset that with gains in Boston and New York. This is a perspective. The average expiring rent in San Francisco was $78, the new rent was $50 and those leases were all done about a year ago, and if we were to mark-to-market all the San Francisco leases today, we'd be about $10 or 20% higher than where we're showing you in our statistics. That market has obviously changed dramatically and it's changed quickly.","Now while San Francisco and the Silicon Valley still have remained the strongest markets in our portfolio, things have slowed down there too. There has been a dropoff of activity versus the last 2 quarters, and statistically, interestingly enough, if you were to read the brokerage reports, you'd actually think things were declining because there was some slight negative absorption, but I think really that's a timing issue. Large transactions and growth in California are still happening. So in the Valley, LinkedIn and Lab 126 have each committed to 530,000 and 350,000 square feet and just in the last week those 2 requirements are about 50% growth. And Autodesk and Yelp and Amazon have all leased incremental space in the traditional CBD San Francisco assets during the quarter.","On the peninsula, there really is a dearth of quality space in the Palo Alto and Mountain View and Cupertino markets, and we are seeing speculative development. Given that there is speculative development, we do expect that there's going to be a reduction in the growth rate in market rents and that things are going to slow down.","In the CBD, our availability of EC is about 4%. We completed 15 transactions during the quarter, but it only totaled 60,000 square feet, for the most part renewals, and we have another 100,000 square feet that are in active negotiations, again, predominantly renewals, given our availability. When we spoke to you in April about New York City, I described that one of the brokers that we deal with and said that his comments were, things were gray, that there wasn't much upward pressure on rent, but the pessimists weren't winning the day. So last week I actually called him and said, \"So this is what you told me last quarter. Would you change your view?\" And he said, \"Well, rents are creeping up a little bit but so is availability and there are a few more pessimists in the market.\" Well, we had a really great second quarter in New York City.","So let's start with 250 West 55th Street. Morrison & Foerster exercised an expansion right and leased an additional 24,000 square feet, but the big news is that we are negotiating a lease with a second law firm for an additional 266,000 square feet in the low rise of the building, which will mean that 250 West 55th will be just under 48% leased with all of the remaining space concentrated on floors 25 to 38, the top of the tower. This is obviously subject to them signing a lease, but we're cautiously optimistic that things are going to move in the right direction.","As Mort said, we've completed additional leasing at 510 Madison and we are now at least 55% leased and we have a number of active discussions on both smaller suite and full floors again. Last Tuesday, we got back 150,000 square feet of space at 399 Park and we've signed 3 leases totaling 112,000 square feet and are negotiating a fourth that will bring our commitments to 136. These are all 10 to 15 year leases. They were cut at starting rents in the low 90s with between $65 and $75 in tenant improvement allowance.","In 2012, just to give you a perspective, there've been 34 high-end midtown leasing deals and we define high-end as deals that are over $90 per square foot and they totaled 752,000 square feet, and that includes renewals and expansions and some relocations. In all of 2011, there were 54 deals totaling 880,000 square feet. So things still are feeling pretty good at the high end, but it is a small market.","Finally, we also signed a 468,000 square foot lease extension with Citibank through 2026 for the low rise of 601. We mentioned that last quarter but the lease was signed during the second quarter. That lease was expected to expire in 2016. They are consolidating from some of their other spaces in midtown, rebuilding their space as we speak. And the rent in 2016 is going to be about equal to what the GAAP rent is today.","There was one major announcement on our press release regarding a termination income. And I did want to give a little bit of color on that. CBS hasshut down their morning show studio at the GM Building and they wanted to get out of the lease. As of July 1, their remaining obligation was $39 million. So we negotiated the deal for them, giving us the space back as of July 1, they paid us $28 million or 71% of the obligation. So we did basically fast-forwarded the rental obligation. And we did this because we made the determination that controlling the space and then trying to lease it put us in a better position of being successful than going out and looking for a tenant and then trying to work out a termination deal with CBS.","Moving down to Boston. We're off to Boston.Activity in Cambridge continues to lead the Boston region. The technology and the life science tenants continue to expand and the market is continuing to tighten. As I mentioned, there are now 6 new buildings under construction, which are committed to Pfizer, Biogen, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, the Broad Institute and Novartis. There's also one speculative building that's going up for about 125,000 square feet. The vacancy rate in East Cambridge is under 10%. You're going to note in our development page of our supplemental that we've added the Google connector building in Cambridge to our statistics. As we mentioned before, the city approved a 43,000 square foot expansion at Cambridge Center in conjunction with the major lease expansion with Google. Google now occupies 144,000 square feet and they've agreed to take another 106,000, including that 43,000 square foot connector. The lease is going to run through the end of 2025. We expect that Google will be fully occupied and the connector will be in service by the third quarter of 2013.","So we're now 99% committed in Cambridge on our 1.6 million square foot portfolio, 17 Cambridge Center is topped out ahead of schedule and should be in service in the third quarter of 2013. What are we doing in Cambridge? Well, we're working with both a tenant and the City of Cambridge to find additional ways to increase the density at Cambridge Center. And so there will be more to talk about hopefully on that in the next few quarters.","In Boston, the CBD had another sort of okay quarter. A little positive absorption, but not much is going to change in the short term because quite frankly, there aren't a lot of 2012 and 2013 tenants in the market and we are in still a lease expiration driven market for the most part in the Boston area. We are negotiating leases on all of the remaining space at Atlantic Wharf, 52,000 square feet, and those leases will commence in '13 and '14. In the Back Bay, we have very limited short-term availability and we continue to do forward leasing. So this quarter, we signed 120,000 square feet of forward extensions in the Hancock Tower and we're working on 1 more that will bring us to the year to about 150,000 square feet. And over the last 12 months, in total, we'll have done about 244,000 square feet of forward leasing in the Hancock Tower.","We've also signed a letter of intent with Blue Cross Blue Shield to lease 330,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue. That lease is going to commence in '15 when the existing tenants, which are Manulife, Arnold Communications and First American, have their leases expire at the end of '14 or in the middle of '14. We have another 90,000 square feet of pending renewals and expansions under negotiation in our Back Bay portfolio and we continue to work on additional forward leasing opportunities. That's what the name of the game is in Boston right now.","Our integration of 100 Federal Street is going as planned and we are negotiating our first full floor lease on one of the 3 currently vacant floors there. In the Boston suburban market, there still is a pretty good pace of organic growth from these tech companies and some of these life science companies. We completed 100,000 square foot lease with New York Life, so there are still some traditional users in the market, to backfill our vacancy in the Waltham portfolio. And we're working with 150,000 square foot user right now on a plan to expand into another 100,000 square feet in one of our new buildings over the next 2 years as other leases expire. There were 2 other 100-plus thousand square foot expansion requirements in the market, and we are talking to tenants about some build-to-suits at our Waltham property. Our renovation of our first building at Bay Colony is complete, and the building is really being well received, now 87% leased and we're on to the second building.","The one market in our portfolio that is really feeling the impact of the election, but also the budgetary issues is obviously Washington, D.C. The unknown impact of the deficit reductions and spending changes, and as well as the presidential election have really created a pretty soft demand environment. I think the one thing people talk about but don't like to sort of mention too loudly is the hypothetical impact of sequestration, which is the automatic budget cuts on the federal jobs because we don't really know what it means, but we know that it would have a severe negative impact on the D.C. economy, but I think there's consensus that we're not hopefully going to get to that point.","In the district, we really just don't see the government expanding in 2012 or 2013. Interestingly, for the first time since 1999, there wasn't much in the way of big leasing in the city, nothing in excess of 100,000 square feet. So the uncertainty is really impacting the GSA world. We continue to struggle with the GSA with our final building at Patriot Park where you saw the last tenant move out during the quarter. We actually have a tenant ready to go, we believe. They're in holdover in their current location. The building is close to in move-in condition, and we're just trying to get the GSA and the government to make a legal decision to move into the building. But we're confident it's going to happen. Over the last few quarters, we've been discussing the market dynamics in D.C. where the next round of large leases are really not coming out on the private sector paces until 2015 and 2016. Well, there are 2 of those major tenants in the market right now with '15 and '16 expirations. And one of them has been reported to have committed to a new development at City Center, that's the property just across from our property at 901 New York.","And the second is talking to us in exclusive discussions about our 478,000 square foot development at Mass Ave. And they are looking at about 320,000 square feet. So if we have a pre-lease commitment, we will start this building towards the end of '13 and we'll hopefully be able to put those -- that tenant into occupancy by the middle to end of 2015. Today, our D.C. portfolio is 97% leased, 83,000 square feet of expirations that are uncovered in 2012. In the short term, we're very, very comfortable with our portfolio. In the long term, we're very comfortable with D.C., and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing happening at 601 next.","Northern Virginia is really where our activity in the short term is, and Reston continues to be the outlier with the consistent activity that Mort alluded to and rents that are in the mid-$40s in the urban core. Our availability is now limited to very smaller blocks of space and we continue to see pretty good activity on that. Now you do have to realize that Reston, while it has its share of defense-related contractors, the makeup of Town Center is actually weighted towards technology companies and engineering companies and professional services companies and educational users, College Board being the largest of those. And we continue to complete deals at One Freedom Square with starting rents in the mid to high $40s while Toll Road deals are being done low $30s with free rent.","As Mort suggested, we've been able to make a second off-market transaction this year and we reached an agreement with Beacon Capital to purchase Fountain Square. Those are the remaining commercial buildings in Reston. We're going to be purchasing the 2 office buildings, which are 540,000 square feet and 270,000 square feet of retail space plus 2 parking structures. Average rents in the portfolio are about $40 a square foot, which is I'd say somewhere between 10% and 20% below market, depending on where they are in the buildings. And the average rent on the retail space is $34 triple net and retail rents average from anywhere in the mid-$30s to as much as $70 or $85 per square foot for some of the smaller spaces. The office tenancy is very diversified. It's actually much smaller than the average tenant size that we have in the rest of our urban core portfolio. Retail sales are pretty strong, excluding the Apple Store. They average about $540 per square foot. But there are lots of operating synergies to be accomplished over time, and clearly, owning more highly desirable space in a very concentrated submarket should create a really great opportunity for us to continue to be very successful in the Reston Town Center.","We've outlined the projected pro forma returns, which are 6% on a GAAP basis and 5.6% on a cash basis, but the returns don't reflect the impact of any savings on the other 2.5 million square feet of space that we own in Town Center or the future opportunities we have with regards to parking income. We continue to believe there is lots of future potential growth and we're very optimistic about the impact that Metro will have on urban core when the station is delivered in a few years. As Mort alluded to, we are working on additional acquisitions, some of them are off market and some of them are being widely marketed. We also are thinking about some selective dispositions and do have some things both on the market and that will be in the market relatively soon, and we will continue to provide you details as these things progress. We're not going to comment on where they are or how big they are as part of our remarks today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I just want to start by quickly going over the activity that we've had in the capital markets. As Mort indicated, in June, we raised $1 billion of senior unsecured bonds. They will mature in February 2023 and they're priced at an all-in yield of 3.95%. We also issued 1.3 million shares, raising $138 million of net proceeds under our equity ATM program in the second quarter. Our capital raising activity restored our cash balances to $1.7 billion. This is after acquiring 100 Federal Street in Boston for $615 million and paying off $780 million of debt in the first half of the year.","We've elected to redeem the remaining $225 million of bonds that expire in January of 2013. These bonds have a coupon of 6.25%, and we've notified the trustee that we will repay them on August 24 using the make-whole provision and documents. This will accelerate the remaining interest payments that are discounted at Treasuries plus 35 basis points into the third quarter of 2012 and reduce our interest expense thereafter. We also expect to prepay a $23 million mortgage on our Sumner Square property in Washington, D.C. On September 1, the prepayment penalty reduces from a yield maintenance penalty to a flat 1% fee. So that's advantageous to us, especially given the high 7.35% coupon that this mortgage carries.","So we have no expiring debt for the remainder of 2012 and after these repayments, we will have about $590 million of maturities in 2013. Our liquidity position provides us with great flexibility to both aggressively seek new opportunities on the investment side and utilize cash to pay off our 2013 expiring debt. Despite all of the economic uncertainties that Mort mentioned, the debt markets have really continued to improve, especially in the last 60 days. Credit spreads in the REIT market have compressed by over 50 basis points, and with the Treasury market hovering at historically low levels, borrowing costs remain incredibly attractive.","Our 10-year bond spreads are now trading in the high 100s, which indicates new issue pricing for 10-year bonds in the 3.25% to 3.5% range. The mortgage market is a little bit slower to react but many of the larger life insurance companies are willing to break the 4% coupon barrier for 10-year loans that they like. And in the CMBS market, origination spreads are relatively unchanged, but as Treasuries have come down, the resulting coupons have really narrowed the pricing gap from more traditional lenders, making the CMBS market also more competitive today.","As Doug discussed, we signed an agreement to acquire a 50% interest in Fountain Square in Reston Town Center. The structure of the transaction includes putting call rights in the future that provides us with the right and also potentially the obligation to acquire the remaining interest in the property in 2016. The accounting associated with the structure provides that we will consolidate the property on our financial statements. The debt associated with Fountain Square totals $211 million and with a coupon of 5.71%, it is significantly above market. We expect that the non-cash fair value debt adjustment will reduce the interest expense by over $6 million annually.","Turning to our second quarter results. Last night, we reported funds from operation of $1.37 per share, which is $22 million or $0.13 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. $15 million of this was due to larger-than-normal termination income, $9 million was additional property and fee income, offset by $2 million of higher interest expense from our $1 billion bond offering that we closed on June 11. The most significant variance to our budget emanated from the execution of the termination agreement with CBS, a 36,000 square foot retail tenant in the GM Building that Doug mentioned. Our joint venture will receive $28 million and after accounting for our 60% share of the building, and the write off of the straight line rent balance, we have an $11 million positive variance to our budget. The full amount of the termination income was booked in the second quarter, so this transaction will reduce our income going forward until the space is relet.","The other unusual item for the quarter was a termination income of $3.6 million from a settlement that we received related to a former tenant bankruptcy. The tenant rejected our lease back in 2009 and we have since released all of the space to other tenants.","The portfolio exceeded our budget by about $5.5 million. The majority of the outperformance is due to savings in operating expenses of $4 million. $3 million of the savings relates to repair and maintenance items that we believe will be completed later in the year, so we'll actually be decreasing our guidance for the remainder of 2012 by this amount. Other improvements in the portfolio came from leasing and parking revenue primarily in Boston and in San Francisco. At the Hancock Tower in Boston, we completed a full floor expansion into previously vacant space and a full floor early renewal that had a 53% increase in rent, demonstrating the potential for rent growth at Hancock Tower.","Our fee income exceeded expectations by $2.6 million, with about $1 million in higher than projected tenant service income and the rest associated with the receipt of contingent development fee income. The contribution from our joint ventures exceeded our budget by $12 million. As I noted, the biggest piece is the $11 million variance from termination income at the GM Building, but we also had an additional $1 million contribution from expense savings and higher than projected percentage rent.","The only other significant change for the quarter was in our interest expense, where the impact of our bond issuance in mid-June added $1.9 million of interest expense that we had not budgeted. In May, we closed on the sale of Bedford Business Park, which we had announced was under contract last quarter. The sale was anticipated, so it had no impact on our budget, but it did result on a gain on sale of $36.9 million that is reflected in our net earnings but is not part of FFO. We structured the transaction as a 1031 lifetime exchange with the acquisition of 2440 West El Camino Real in San Francisco that we closed last -- late last year. So the gain will not have an impact on our dividend distribution requirements.","As we look forward to the rest of 2012, the most significant change we have to our guidance is from the impact of the interest expense associated with our bond offering that adds $20 million to our interest expense. This is partially offset by the improvement in leasing at the John Hancock Tower, 399 Park Avenue and the pending acquisition of Fountain Square.","As we've discussed in prior calls, we expect our full year 2012 same-store NOI to be down from 2011 due to the rollover we experienced in Embarcadero Center and Gateway Center in San Francisco, Patriots Park in Reston and 399 Park Avenue in New York City. Now as Doug noted, the demand for space at 399 Park Avenue has been really strong and we now have commitments on nearly all of the available space, which is reducing our downtime projections. We also completed earlier-than-projected leasing at the Hancock Tower in Boston and at One and Two Freedom Square in Reston. The result of this leasing is improvement in our projected same-store GAAP NOI for 2012 and we now project a decline of only 0.5% to 1% from 2011. This is a 75 basis point improvement from last quarter.","As most of this leasing contains free-rent periods, our 2012 cash same-store NOI projections are relatively unchanged, at negative 1% to negative 1.5% from 2011. As we expected, our occupancy declined slightly to 91.6% with the move out of 186,000 square feet in Three Patriots Park by Lockheed Martin and bringing 510 Madison Avenue fully into service at just over 50% occupied. We expect our occupancy to remain relatively stable between 91% and 92% through the end of 2012.","The 2012 projected NOI contribution from our developments is slightly better than our budget last quarter at $68 million to $72 million with better-than-projected rental revenue coming from the Residences on The Avenue in Washington, D.C., and lower expenses at 510 Madison Avenue. These numbers include both 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue and Atlantic Wharf as they will not be in the same-store portfolio until next year. We expect that our straight line rents and fair value lease revenue for the consolidated portfolio, including our development, will total $90 million to $94 million for 2012. This is higher than last quarter due to our success in backfilling the expiring space at 399 Park Avenue and the additional leasing I mentioned at the Hancock Tower.","Our Cambridge Center Hotel had another solid quarter. RevPAR is up 11% year-to-date over last year. Our projections are in line with where we were last quarter and we anticipate the hotel will contribute between $9 million and $10 million to our 2012 FFO. The contribution from our JV portfolio beat our projections in the second quarter by $12 million, due primarily to termination income. We are not projecting replacing the lost CBS rental income for the rest of 2012, so we will give back a portion of the second quarter outperformance. For the full-year 2012, we are projecting joint venture FFO contribution to be $135 million to $140 million, which is up about $10 million from our projection last quarter. The joint venture projections include $54 million of fair value lease revenue and $6 million to $10 million straight-line rent. Our 2012 projection for development and management services income is $30 million to $34 million, it's up $2.5 million to -- better than projected second quarter fee income.","Our G&A expenses are right in line with last quarter, we project between $85 million and $87 million for the year. Net interest expense will be higher than our prior projection due primarily to our recent bond offering that adds $20 million to the full year net of interest income. For the full year 2012, we expect our net interest expense to be $408 million to $412 million with capitalized interest for the year projected to be $42 million to $45 million. We anticipate that the acquisition of Fountain Square will close by the end of the third quarter. We've disclosed the anticipated returns in our press release and based upon our 50% share, we project it to contribute just over a penny per share to our 2012 FFO.","So if you take all of these assumptions into account, we are modifying our 2012 FFO guidance range to $4.85 to $4.91 per share. At the midpoint, this is in line with our previous projection despite the increase in net interest expense of approximately $0.12 per share and dilution from the issuance of equity under our ATM program of $0.02 per share. The offsetting positives are the improvements in the portfolio, additional fee income, the termination income from the second quarter and the acquisition of Fountain Square.","For the third quarter, we project FFO of $1.13 to $1.15 per share. The third quarter is impacted by seasonality, which results in higher utility expenses plus the deferral of repair and maintenance items from the second quarter, which in aggregate is projected to increase our expenses by about $6 million from the second quarter.","In addition, the redemption of $225 million of unsecured bonds will result in the acceleration of $3.5 million of interest expense into the third quarter with no expense for these bonds in the fourth quarter. Now we won't be providing specific guidance for 2013 until next quarter, but I would like to mention the impact that our leasing success over the past few quarters will have on our 2013 cash NOI. We have a number of large leases that are in free rent periods during 2012, including at Embarcadero Center, at 111 Huntington Avenue, Cambridge Center, Reston Overlook and 399 Park Avenue, in addition to leasing in our recent development deliveries, where we will see free rent convert to cash rent by 2013.","Just in this handful of properties, we project approximately $45 million of cash NOI improvement next year. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you want to open the line for questions, that will be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first call comes in the line of Michael Knott.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Hey guys, I was curious if you can talk a little bit about your lease roll in '13. It looks fairly manageable, any thoughts on mark-to-market there and then also '14 roll picks up a little bit more, just any thoughts on any possibilities there or potential mark-to-market opportunities in that bunch?","Douglas T. Linde","This is Doug, Michael. I think the mark-to-market that we have is clearly on the positive slope at this point. We are probably somewhere in the \"mid-40s\" on an average rent going forward in 2013, and I wouldn't be surprised to think that, that portfolio is probably somewhere between $0.07 to $0.10 below market because all of the drag we've had over the last few quarters has been in San Francisco. So the good news is that we are now below market in San Francisco in total on a going-forward basis. So I think that '14 and '15 is really Back Bay-centric. And the goal we have is to get in front of that leasing as quickly and as expeditiously as we possibly can in the context of making sure that we're not leaving money on the table. And we've -- as I think I've suggested, we've been pretty successful with that portfolio, and that's really the space that we've described in 101 Huntington Avenue and at the John Hancock Tower. Most of our suburban exposure in that same period of time is in Waltham, and we're actively working on that as well. So we feel pretty good about the manageability of where we have the vacancy upcoming and our expectations of being able to do something with that tenancy prior to those leases actually turning over.","Michael E. LaBelle","Michael, you're right in that it's relatively low. I mean, it's 4.7% of the portfolio. Our typical -- if you think about our average lease rate, it would typically be between 9% and 10%. But obviously, as we get closer, we're doing forward leasing all the time, so it tends to reduce down as we get closer to the year. So again, as Doug said, if you look at 2014 right now, it's 10%. By the time we get there, it's going to be less than 10% because we're doing allot of that leasing now.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","All right. That makes sense. And then just on your comments on '13 cash same-store NOI growth, so the $45 million number might be just throughout -- that's kind of just a base starting line for when we think about what '13 probably looks like. It's not going to be limited to just that, I would think. Is that a fair assumption?","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes, that's fair. I mean, we've -- like I said, we're not going to give 2013 projections on this call, but I did want to give a sense. Because we've talked about the fact that 2012 was a transition year, the fact that we had a lot of leasing that we did and we had a lot of free rent this year, so I wanted to demonstrate just in kind of 5 or 6 properties, there's a significant amount of change for '13.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","On a percentage basis, that's what, 4% or 5% right offhand?","Michael E. LaBelle","That sounds about right.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, Doug, you talked about your confidence in Boston Properties continuing to fare well in sort of a low-job-growth, low-demand environment. Do you guys feel confident that you can","[Audio Gap]","historical occupancy rates of, call it, 95%, I think, is prior peak kind of levels. Do you feel like you can get back to that in the next couple of years?","Douglas T. Linde","I do. I can tell you that if you look at our availability today, the bulk of that availability is in 2 places. The first is in suburban Boston, and we are, in fact, seeing a pretty, pretty consistent organic growth of technology and biotech companies out there. These are not household names from a public market cap perspective, but they probably are household names in the venture world. And I think the other area where we have large vacancy is in the suburban San Francisco portfolio, from a total square footage perspective, and we're encouraged by the ability to lease space in Silicon Valley on a going-forward basis because there really just isn't a lot of high-quality space there to be leased. So those 2 areas, I think, are probably the largest numbers. I think picking up 183,000 square feet in Reston, hopefully next quarter, will go a long way to basically putting us in a position where those are really 2 of the major exposures. And then, obviously, 510 Madison, we have 130,000 square feet of leasing that we're going to get done there, which I think will, again, impact our occupancy numbers in a very positive way.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just talk a little bit about investment opportunity. I know we're just about passing the fourth anniversary of your acquisition of the GM Building and 540 and 125. And I was curious if there's been any news or anything you can enlighten us on the opportunity to sort of increase the stake vis-\u00e0-vis your joint venture partner's interest there.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I don't think we have any -- this is Mort. I don't think we have any indication of any change in their interest, but I can tell you that if there is any change, we will probably be one of the first to talk to them about it.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you'd expect them to be long-term holders there?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, not necessarily. I mean, I don't have any way of adjusting, and I think one of the particular investors might very well be interested in reviewing their position here. But we haven't heard anything about that for quite a number of months, and we haven't seen anything happening there. So we just don't know where they are. But I can tell you, we are very bullish about these assets, and I'm sure that so are they. They're not going to have too many opportunities to invest in real estate of that quality.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So on the GM Building, the CBS space, could you just give us a sense of what the rent was for that space and maybe what the opportunity might look like? I know, Mike, you said in your comments you're not assuming anything in 2012 in terms of backfilling it. But what might a re-leasing opportunity look like for that space?","Douglas T. Linde","So let me answer the first question, Jordan, which is -- so we told you what the total remaining obligation was and how long the lease was going. It was going through, I believe, middle of '15. And I think we told you what the square footage was. It was 39,000 square feet. So you can get a sense of -- you can figure out what the rent was. The space is in 2 pieces. There's a concourse level space, and then there's space that's in the -- on the first floor of the building. And there are users who are looking for one of those 2 pieces, and there are users who are looking for -- who would consider taking some mezzanine space or some concourse space, as well as some first floor space. We're encouraged by the type of interest we have in the space. We're not expecting to announce a deal in the next 6 weeks and have rent commencement in 2012. It's an important space. It's an expensive space, so it's for the right client at the right time, but we're encouraged by the demand we've had. We had a very seriously interested tenant a few weeks ago that continues to talk to us, and there are others who are now aware that the space is available. We are doing some work to improve the visibility of the space. You can then imagine that CBS and their use of the space was not a traditional use, given the fact that there was a studio. So in order to sort of explain and expose the space to the market, we have to do some work to improve its visibility, and in order to do that, we had to get the space back. So we think we're going to be successful with this space. I can't tell you why.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. Last, a little more administrative. I noticed that 510 went up in terms of the size of the building. I assume remeasurement. Can you maybe just describe what went on there? I mean, it looks like you did a little bit -- when you sort of back in to the remeasuring, maybe the leasing there in the quarter was a little bit more than we would've expected on the surface.","Michael E. LaBelle","The square footage did increase a little bit. We had not included the fitness center space in the square footage before. So that's really the increase in the square footage. And what is the second part of your question? Sorry, Jordan.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That doesn't affect the volume of leasing that's been done there essentially, right?","Michael E. LaBelle","No.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. You're just -- the denominator is bigger, but the volume of leasing is just the same number?","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Stevenson.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you -- Doug or Mike, can you talk a little bit about the San Francisco portfolio and when the year-over-year comps for you guys normalize and it stops being such a negative impact on the NOI?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, it's already stopped being a negative impact on the NOI. It's only a negative impact on our same-store leasing statistics because as the spaces are already been let, and so all we're doing is we're doing the comparison from where the rents were to where the rents are. So there is no negative impact on our numbers, and it's not going down. It's actually going up because as we burn off free rent, as Mike suggested, and we're doing build-out, we're gaining both occupancy as well as revenue recognition. But as each of the leases commence, from an economic perspective, we're explaining to the world what the previous rent was versus that rent. And again, that's why there's that statistical impact. But I think we've been explaining this now ad nauseum for the better part of 2.5 years. And we are now positive mark-to-market in a big way in San Francisco.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And you guys are showing 90.6% leased on Embarcadero 4 in the supplemental. Where is that on a committed basis today?","Michael R. Walsh","96%, Rob. It's Mike Walsh. On your earlier question, once we get to the fourth quarter, you'll start to see the same store flatten out because of the 200,000 square feet of leasing that we've talked about over the -- as Doug said, over the past 2 or 3 years.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then Doug or Mort, are you seeing more of your typical high-quality assets that you guys target coming to market as we move to the fall here? Seems to have been a big lull in transactions in most of your markets at the high end over the last 3 to 6 months. And is there any real importance from guys that you talk to these days in getting deals done under the current tax code and perspective changes as we move into '13? And has that affected the decision-making process?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I'll answer that part. We haven't seen very much in the way of an increase in available assets to be purchased. There is always some, and we're sort of always in that game. I do think that the financial strength and resources that we have will give us a comparative advantage as well as the ability to move quickly. But as you know, these things are -- each one of them is a one-off transaction and we are always in the flow of them. And sometimes they go through and sometimes they don't for various reasons. But there is not a great supply of the kind of assets that we would like to buy.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one quick for Mike. Where are you guys sitting in terms of the taxable earnings in the dividend today? I mean, you guys have a fairly low payout. Is it going to be -- the upward pressure here, you said that the gains didn't do anything to that. But is the pushup in just overall earnings growth, as you see in '12 and '13, likely to force your guys' hand on the dividend as we rotate in the beginning of the year?","Michael E. LaBelle","I mean, I would expect our taxable income to continue to go up. It went up in 2011. It went up to a point in 2011 when -- that we decided that it was the right thing to do, at the end of '11, to increase the dividend. With some of the acquisition activity that we're having, it's going up in '12 as well. We're going to be reviewing our dividend projections with our board next quarter and talking a little about -- further about what we're to do going forward into '13. Taxable income is also impacted by cash. So as the free rent becomes cash rent, it has an impact on taxable income as well. So that is something that we're going to be looking -- we look at it on a quarterly basis, so we're going to be looking at it in a much more formal way heading into the third and fourth quarters of this year.","Douglas T. Linde","Yes, Rob, I'll just mention one thing. I guess I'd suggest that the word force is not the right word. We're encouraged that our income and our taxable income, because our earnings are going up, is going to increase. And if that results in a requirement by the REIT statute to increase our dividend, that's not a bad thing. So we're not being forced to do it, we're happy to earn our way into a higher dividend.","Operator","Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question is for Mort or for Doug. Just given that the election is coming up, sort of curious with New York office, the tenants being on hold through the election and certainly similar in D.C., what do you think happens the day after the election if Romney wins or if Obama wins again? Do you think suddenly that changes leasing decisions one way or the other or the crisis of confidence that business leaders are facing means that it's going to take more than just the election?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, it's Mort, I'm going to take a crack at that. I do think that there is the widest range of unease in the business and financial community that I've ever witnessed in relation to a particular government. I've expressed it in the following way. Generally speaking, in America, we boo the loser. But this is an administration that boos the winner. I think people are very, very uncomfortable about that, and they don't know exactly where it goes or where it's going to take this administration. But in any event, they don't like it. So my general view is that, and not only in terms of the personalities, but also in terms of the general policies, that a Romney election would be better received by the overall business community and would, I think, give a lot more confidence going forward to the business community because 4 years is an awfully long time on top of what has been 4 of the weakest years in our economy since the 1930s. So I do think that's going to have a serious effect on the economy. Another thing that is going to be really critical is this so-called fiscal cliff. I mean, here we have an economy that's growing somewhere, if it's growing at all, it's not growing more than, on an annualized basis, more than 1%, 1.5%. If you hit that fiscal cliff and nothing is done about it because of a lack of leadership or because of dysfunctional government or a level of partisanship that makes everything impossible, you are looking at a major, major effect on the economy probably in the range of 4% of GDP, and that means you would almost guarantee a real slowdown in the economy next year. We just don't know how this is all going to play out. You always would like to think that there is a certain level of maturity in our national leadership, both in the Congress and in the executive branch. But I must say, a lot of people are disappointed with that expectation, and I just don't know how this is going to play out. But those are the issues that are at risk as we sit here and look at the election. I have long believed that this election is going to be determined by the economy, but particularly by the unemployment numbers, and the unemployment numbers are much worse than the headline numbers, so we're just going to have to see how that plays out because the real campaign has not started. It will start only after Romney accepts the nomination at his party convention and the country begins to really focus in on this, which typical [ph] September and October. And that's when we'll get a feel for where it is and whether or not there's going to be any new proposals, economic proposals, given what might be happening in the economy.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But if Obama wins, do you think that business -- that the leasing decisions, those leaders will stay on hold? Or ultimately, because of restocking and efficiency of space, they'll have to get on with it and start actively looking at taking new space or committing to new buildings?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I do think that an Obama election will undoubtedly suppress some of the willingness of American business to invest, to renew, to add space. I absolutely do think that, that is a part of it. I'm astonished, frankly. I've never gotten -- never seen anything like what we are going through now, where there is such a void of confidence in the financial and economic leadership of the country. I say this, by the way, as somebody who voted for and supported Obama in the last election, but I do think that this is a very serious issue that, at least, I have never witnessed anything close to what exists today. And the conversations and the public measurement of confidence on the part of the business world in the economy, it's very, very shaky, in part because the economy has been so weak for so long and in part because there's a feeling that the macroeconomic policies, as compared to the monetary policies, have really not worked. We've really had a failure of policy, which, I have to say, was reasonably predictable. And whether or not you have another level of political gridlock going into the next couple of years, it's going to be really important for the business community because, in a sense, a lot of what we're going to be looking for is going to have to come out of Washington in terms of starting up energy in the economy. And particular, as we know, the animal spirits, as we -- phrase that we use in America to describe the economy, is very important. It really does reflect confidence, and I don't think anybody will deny that diminution of confidence in the business world that has taken place over the last 3 or 4 years over what's happened in Washington.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is just looking at assets, especially with the propensity of the tech tenants to like older industrial assets. Can you just talk about if you guys are sort of evolving, in which case you would start to look at some of these older industrial-style assets that may be attractive to tech? And then also, we heard that you guys have a site, maybe it's under option, on the far west side of New York. If you could just comment on that.","Douglas T. Linde","I'm going to -- let me start on that one. So I guess I would respectfully disagree with your view that they are looking for older industrial properties. If you go down to the Silicon Valley, you won't find any older industrial properties. You'll find campuses that have been created over the last 25 years, which are made up of suburban office buildings of between 3 and 6 stories, with floor plates between 35,000 and 50,000 square feet, which have more amenities than you can shake a stick at, and either parking fields and\/or parking structures and the hope of public transportation. And that's the heart of the technology business in California. As companies have come into the city, they have -- small companies have sort of looked at some of this, what we refer to as brick-and-beam older rehab building construction. But many of the buildings that are being occupied by technology companies in the city of San Francisco are traditional office buildings with modern HVAC electrical distribution systems, good-quality floor plates, good light and air. And the way they're using the space is different than what a traditional law firm might be using that space. If you go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of the products have been built since the late '70s, early '80s, and they are 3-story, 5-story, 7-story, 11-story, 15-story office buildings. They are brick for the most part. Some of them are curtain wall, and they are occupied by Google and EMC and Microsoft and VMware and Akamai and all the sort of brand-name companies, as well as a number of smaller companies, whose names we haven't heard of. And again, very traditional space. Now there are locations like Midtown South where -- that have developed, where companies have been looking for inexpensive space, traditionally, and they have migrated to what I would refer to as non-A buildings. And that seems to be a trend that is important down there. But I -- we believe that as those tenants become more sophisticated and they grow and they become larger, they will struggle to want to locate in those types of environments. That's not to say that there won't be a new generation of up-and-coming venture capital and entrepreneurial companies that won't want that space, but the companies that are growing and being successful will have to find and migrate into what I would refer to as more traditional space. So while there is clearly an interest in that type of space, we believe that there is just as much of an interest and a need for great, traditional, new construction buildings that were built in locations and have amenities packages and transportation networks and demographics that are attractive to buildings that we earn -- that we own today.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Spector.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on New York City, Doug. I thought it was interesting when we discussed the theory -- the fact that in San Francisco, you're seeing -- you always see new media and tech companies expand, but you're not seeing that in New York City. Any change there? Anything to do with those tenants in New York?","Douglas T. Linde","I didn't catch the drift? What kind of tenants?","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The new media and tech tenants. In San Francisco, you had commented you're constantly seeing those tenants look to expand, that they're hiring for more space. But in New York City, you haven't really seen that. Any change there?","Douglas T. Linde","I would, I guess -- we don't -- we're not in the midst of what's going on in Midtown South. But tenants like Google are, in fact, expanding, and tenants like Microsoft are, in fact, expanding and Oracle and companies like that because, quite frankly, they need to improve their employment base because they're looking for the most qualified interesting types of folks to work in those organizations. And so they are expanding in sort of modest ways in New York City. And then you do have a number of technology companies that are in the either social media or the digital media or the media content business that are -- that we are aware of that are growing in Midtown South and other places. So there is expansion. I think my point was and this is -- for people who weren't part of the conversation, the discussion was: At what point will, if at all, those larger companies start to look at some of the buildings in places like Sixth Avenue, which have very large floor plates and are very significant assets as a viable location for those types of enterprises? And there are some that are looking today, but they are the more traditional, what we would refer to as mature companies and not that sort of new-of-breed companies. But time will tell.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up question on the acquisition. I guess it's hard to tell if Mort was more optimistic that you might see more acquisitions in the next couple of years, but it ties into what some of our broker contacts have been saying. It seems that some families, let's say in New York City, there's a little bit more talk today than in the past of possibly selling over the next couple of years, I'm not talking about this year given the tax issue, but just over the next couple of years versus years ago there really wasn't that buzz. Is that an accurate statement? Or do you feel like it's really -- there's always buzz?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I'll try my hand at that. No, there always is buzz, but I do think there is more buzz, if I can say that, these days. Look, everybody's very nervous just about the future of the economy and how it would affect every market, but it also is going to affect New York. New York has had also extraordinary fiscal and political leadership over the last 20 years between Giuliani and Bloomberg, and nobody knows who the next mayor is going to be and what effect that will have on the general business environment. So I do think there's more chatter. But a lot of these things, as you know, there are a lot of families in New York that own a lot of real estate. When they move, they move slowly at first and then very quickly. Our whole effort will be to be around and be a part of those discussions when they move. And we just can't be any more specific about predictions than that.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then -- this is Jamie Feldman, here with Jeff. I just have a quick follow-up. On San Francisco, I mean, we're hearing that some of the wind was kind of taken off the sales in that market with the Facebook IPO. Some of the tech companies have been a little bit below expectations, and then we have some new developments coming online. I mean, can you guys talk about your multiyear view here and kind of where we are in the phase of the recovery in the [indiscernible] and then also in the valley?","Douglas T. Linde","I think, Jamie, our multiyear view is that if you're looking for the formation of wealth and knowledge-based companies, the greater San Francisco area has -- is the dominant cluster of where those businesses want to locate and where the really intellectually capable employees migrate to when they're looking to find fame and fortune, I'm not being facetious, in the U.S. economy. And so we continue to see that as being a critically important part of the growth of the country's economic prosperity, and therefore, we think it's a great place to own real estate if we can find it and it's well priced and well located. As I said, things clearly have slowed down in San Francisco, but they were going at such a rapid pace, that -- I mean, when you see a 500 basis points reduction in the availability rate in a major market in a little less than a year, that's a pretty extraordinary phenomenon, and it can't stay up that way forever. And San Francisco has always been a volatile market. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of these companies actually don't survive. I mean, it's not like every IPO technology company is going to survive for the next 25 years and become the next Microsoft or the next Apple, so we're going to see failures. But I think out of those same companies, there are going to be lots of great employees who can find other places to work and other things to do, which will be a great bench for the growth of that particular marketplace. So I think you're going to see the ups and downs of that market. But in the sort of big picture, I think, you're going to see a lot of progress and a lot of opportunity there because that's, quite frankly, where wealth accretion is occurring.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask one more on D.C. I mean, sentiment, including yours, every other we've spoken to is pretty negative. What's kind of the best-case scenario for the office markets in D.C. over the next 12 or 18 months?","Douglas T. Linde","Mr. Ritchey, do you want to take that one?","Raymond A. Ritchey","That's -- I'm happy to give it a shot, let's just say. It's -- we talk about the presidential election, but I think even more important is going to be the congressional flavor coming out of the election as well. They're the ones who really set the agenda relative to dealing with GSA. Clearly, I'm not so concerned about GSA because they have expirations and -- which they have to address. What I'm much more concerned about is the defense contractors and the sequestration that Doug addressed has really had these organizations on the sidelines. And what has to come out in early '13 is a clear direction of what the Congress and the national budget is going to have to do relative to defense. And specifically, not necessarily cutting a carrier base out of [indiscernible] but what does it mean for cyber security, what does it mean for the support of the CIA and other intelligence organizations, and everybody is just sitting on the sidelines until there's a clear direction and the Congress has to come out with a clear direction on the defense budget very early in 2013 for this to turn around.","Operator","Your next question is from John Guinee.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Doug, congratulations, and Ray, congratulations on Fountain Square. It looks to me as if the all-in's probably $400 million when you exercise your option on the second part of buying out Beacon. And then you'll probably end at about $500 a foot, which, on one hand, seems like a high number; but on the other hand, roughly 1\/3 of the space is retail. Can you bifurcate sort of on a price per pound what you think you pay for the office versus what you're paying for the retail at Fountain Square? And then second, when you control all this retail, control all the parking, how does it change how you operate that oasis?","Douglas T. Linde","Ray, why don't you and Peter talk about how it changes the operation of the environment there and what we're -- what we will do over time. And Michael can do some calculations and try to answer John's technical question.","Raymond A. Ritchey","Peter, why don't you give it a shot on the operational side.","Peter Johnston","Sure. The point going forward for us is Metro, as everyone is aware, is going to be arriving in Reston in late 2016 or early 2017. Between the urban core properties that we'll control, with the addition of Beacon parking spaces and then the ones that we built along the toll road, you're probably talking somewhere plus or minus 10,000 to 12,000 parking spaces. Metro, right now, at a typical Metro garage, you're looking at anywhere from $5 to $6 a day for someone to park there. Unlike all of the other locations for that rail system going out the toll road to Reston Town Center station, no municipal-driven parking decks are going to be built. So if you think about Reston really running from the toll road north all the way to the north boundary of the urban core at New Dominion, we're effectively going to be controlling all of the public parking, I would say. There are some commercial apartment and residential buildings that are not open to the public. So our leases are written as are -- from what we've seen, Beacon's leases the ability to, over time, charge for parking on renewals, if it's a part of what a market rate would be. So we think the upside operationally there is excellent. We're already in the process of putting gate arms in as a transition, which is to say getting our customer base and the retail customers used to the prospect of coming in to a controlled environment as a precursor to being able to charge for parking.","Raymond A. Ritchey","Let me just talk a little bit about the leasing as well. Beacon did a great job in re-leasing and stabilizing this asset. I mean, it's -- we're buying an asset that's 98% leased and less than 10% rollover over the next 3 years, about 3% per year for the next 3 years. The average tenant size in there is 9,800 square feet, as opposed to on our side, which is 42,000 square feet. So what we're seeing with the smaller tenants, they're much less price-sensitive than the larger tenants, and we view this as a perfect complement to our existing portfolio and to control 2 million-plus square feet in a market where there is extraordinary barriers to entry. You talk about replacement costs, well this is a market where it's almost impossible to replace an asset comparable to Reston Town Center. So if we sound enthusiastic about this acquisition, it's because we definitely are.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess on the square foot, maybe we'll talk about that later.","Michael E. LaBelle","Yes. John, just to get on the -- talk to you a little bit about the valuations. I mean, the way we look at the retail, as Doug mentioned, the run rates in the retail range anywhere from the high $30s to the $80 range on a market basis. And today, it's in the mid $30s triple net. We think that, that retail is worth somewhere between $650 to $700 a square foot probably, given the higher net income from that, NOI from that. The office space is about $40 on a gross basis, which is a little under $30 on a net basis. Again, we think it's a little bit below market, as Doug mentioned. So if you had to do a split, you might do a split of $450-or-so for the office and $650 to $700 for the retail, something like that.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then a follow-up question. One thing that always interests me is that south San Francisco market tends to be in a world of its own relative to the continuum from San Francisco down to Silicon Valley. Can you talk about how you look at the south San Francisco relative to the rest of the peninsula?","Douglas T. Linde","Bob, you want to take that?","Robert E. Pester","Sure. I mean, clearly, it's a biotech-driven market and Genentech being the biggest player there. As the market gets tighter, we have seen people transition up from the mid-peninsula towards south San Francisco. The [indiscernible] activity overall right now remains very static. We hope that Genentech continues to expand. But barring that, we think activity is going to remain slow there for this foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question is from the Chris Caton.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to come back on the leasing results or -- and the leasing plan for the rest of the year. You've done -- you've executed around 2, 2.5 million square feet against, I'd say, 5 million last year. With about 1\/3 of that, I think, over 2 leases this year. How is the leasing pipeline shaping up for the rest of the year? Is it active? Is it -- or can you give us a little more color there?","Douglas T. Linde","I would say that it is active, but it is clearly slower than it was last year largely due to the fact that we don't have nearly as many renewal opportunities in the portfolio as we otherwise would have had. And I think we've made this point clear in previous discussions. Most tenants, when they're looking for larger requirements, get out in front of their availability by certainly 12 months plus. And so to the extent that something is not leased today and we're not working on it, it's not going to hit our statistics for the third or the fourth quarter. And we have good activity. We've got a bunch of larger transactions that are in place. Will we get to where we were last year? I don't think we can. I mean, we just don't have the square footage to lease.","Raymond A. Ritchey","I don't think we need to, Doug. That's the point.","Michael E. LaBelle","No, I mean, I think, that as Doug mentioned, a lot of the leasing we're doing is forward leasing. It's for '13 and '14 and '15. For '12, we just -- we don't have that much coming due. If you kind of look at what we indicated our occupancy projection would be and you look at what our rollover is, we're really talking about doing 1 million, 1.2 million square feet that will kind of affect 2012. Now we're going to do a lot more leasing than that, but it's going to be for '13 and '14. And we do have quite a few larger deals that we're working on, but again, that's for later in the year. But if you think about what happens with '12, it's really looking at our occupancy and where rollover is.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Last question for me would be on PayPal and Boston. I think they're moving maybe from North Beach, so maybe they were always going to go into the CBD. But I wonder did they contemplate other submarkets and if you have any color on how they thought about leasing the space. If you do, that would be helpful.","Douglas T. Linde","Bryan?","Bryan J. Koop","This is Bryan. What we're finding from tech companies, as Doug mentioned, there's, call it larger expansion of what is a tech company, and they would fit into it, is that we are seeing greater, call it variability in the type of product that they're looking at, and they're really focusing on what we're calling -- let's call it the big 3, which is the focus on where can they get their talent, where can they project their brand and their culture, and where can they be connected. And what we're finding is that we are seeing an increase in these tech companies looking into CBD because it is, as Doug mentioned, really great quality space. They haven't traditionally, call it, looked at it, but they're finding good bargains there. So it's fitting a lot of things like the essentials of transportation. And it really didn't surprise us when we heard about the deal being finalized at International Place. It's a great building, and you look at that location, it's very attractive for the things that these types of companies are looking to do. And I think I'd just echo Doug's comments on, it isn't just, call it, the brick and beam that's attractive to these tech companies. They want to fulfill getting talent, and these are spots that are going to become really attractive. We're finding it in 100 Fed. Our lower floors of that building, the balds [ph] floors as we call it, have suddenly become attractive to several companies like that. We're in discussions with clients like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Attie.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman with Josh. Doug, when you think about this $1.7 billion of cash, that basically takes care of the bond redemption, all the cash for Fountain, takes care of all equity funding for the development pipeline that you currently have underway and takes care of all the bond maturities for next year. The $1.7 billion in total. So I'm just curious, as you think about, I think Mort talked in his opening comments about 2 projects in the next short while, I don't know if that was in reference to developments like Mass Ave or if that was acquisitions. How quickly would you want to replenish or gain more capacity, especially now with where bond yields are, being able to do a 10-year in the low-3s or continued ATM issuance? I'm just curious how you think about the capacity side of it.","Douglas T. Linde","The way we think about it, and this is probably not going to be a very satisfying answer to you, so I apologize in advance, is that we think about what our opportunity set might in terms of use of capital, what our liquidity looks like in a short-term and a medium-term basis and at what point do we feel that the markets are changing in a way that could impact that decision-making. The point being that, yes, we have $600,000 -- $600 million of expirations in the middle of 2013 on the bond side, but we're not really thinking about prefunding that in the next 6 months but -- sorry, next 60 days. But our anticipation is we will prefund that at some point. And the question is: Will we have used our cash or not used our cash? If we have found things to invest in that are both value-accretive and earnings-accretive and opportunities to improve the growth of the company, we will do that, and we'll figure out how to capitalize those opportunities based upon what the capital structure of those assets may be. So for example, if we're buying an asset that is 80% leverage, probably doesn't make a lot of sense to necessarily use debt financing to purchase that asset. On the other hand, if we're buying an asset that is 100% unencumbered, having a mix of equity and a mix of debt and selling some assets or raising equity or doing a bond issuance or doing a convertible or doing some preferred, perpetual preferred, which is certainly an option to us now. All those things are on the table.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you talked in your opening comments about having some dispositions that were on the market and some that you're going to bring to market, what does that sort of represent in terms of dues in those assets? Has the growth profile changed? Or has your view of the growth profile changed? Is it submarkets that you want to exit? Is it how the market is going to price those assets that's making it enticing? And you think back to '06 when you obviously did some very large sales at some very low cap rates, can you sort of compare and contrast sort of this disposition activity that you're embarking on and that?","Douglas T. Linde","I think all the things that you said were accurate, and it was a well spoken sort of explanation of what I'm going to say. I'd say the thing that's changing is that there are probably a few more, what I would refer to as not core assets that we are sort of moving out of, aka the Bedford Research Park, which was a $63 million asset. There are a number of those that we are looking at in addition to getting out of some high-quality core assets that we think somebody else's view of what the potential of those assets are versus what ours is may be higher, and therefore, we're going to get paid very well to exit those assets and be able to redeploy the capital into something else.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify Mort's comment at the beginning in terms of the 2 projects. That was related to 2 potential development starts or that represented acquisitions?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll let Mort clarify.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Acquisitions.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Josh. Can you quantify what some of the initial cost synergies might be at Fountain Square with what you already own in Reston? It looks like the operating margins on what you bought are around 64%. How does that compare with what you already own?","Douglas T. Linde","I'm going to be honest with you, Josh. You're being far more inquisitive than we are yet ready to answer. I will say this that we think we're going to be able to reduce the cost that Beacon is expending to operate the buildings, not insignificantly, in the order of $7,500 a square foot. And in addition, adding the math and reorganizing how we manage the property and start to bid out with larger square footage on certain types of enterprises, like landscaping and security and all those sort of things, should reduce our costs on our existing buildings. And the question is: What does it mean for our tenants? And what does it mean for us? To the extent that we have triple net leases, it just means the tenants have a lower cost of occupancy, which is a great thing. And to the extent we have gross leases, it means that there's obviously more income coming in the door than there otherwise would have been. But that will play itself out over time.","Operator","The next question is from David Harris [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I wonder if you could just talk about your appetite for the joint ventures. And I'd like you to comment both on your appetite and third parties'. Would you be able to distinguish between the third-party interest domestically and from overseas sources?","Douglas T. Linde","Could you -- I just -- David, could you just explain that again? I'm confused as to what you're referring to.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, just talk about your appetite for further JVs and what the interest from third parties might be. And as an adjunct to that, could you distinguish between the appetite from third parties that are based domestically and those that are perhaps from overseas sources?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, let me give one part of that, okay? I think there is still a lot of sources from outside the United States who want to invest in high-quality real estate here in the United States. We are equal opportunity partners that we're happy to work with them, and we're happy to work with other institutions here in the United States. But I think a lot of the people feel -- people who are managing funds in Europe and indeed, in Asia are really much more confident about the American economy than they are in their own economies. The European economy is in very, very serious shape, and everything depends there, in the short run, on the central bank; but over the intermediate term, on whether or not they can get their economies moving again. And the same thing is true of a lot of the countries in Asia. And they still have a lot of funds to put out, and I think frankly, we probably have good access to these investors who are really contacting us on a regular basis and have been for years. But the real issue from our point of view is: Can we find the kind of assets that we want to buy? This is not an easy question to answer because we really have very high standards, and those standards are not just a measure of social standards. We have had a long experience in terms of what we think not only works in good times, but most particularly, we have a very -- and always have had, a very real concern on the assets that would do well in difficult times, which is why we always say we try and buy A assets in A locations and quite simply it's because those are the assets that do relatively better in difficult times, not -- you don't only compare them to good times, and that's what a lot of investors are looking for. Those assets do not come along every day, every week or every month, and we just are in that flow. And if we can find those assets, we will be very active in trying to acquire them on reasonable terms, and at some point, we might very well involve ourselves to a greater degree than we have in the past, in partnership with some of these international or foreign funds that are certainly all around the real estate market. They like real estate because it is a real asset. They're very worried about assets where there could be a decline in value. If you have real estate assets, which are reasonably well leased, even though the yields are relatively low compared to historical numbers at which you can acquire these assets, the fact is that they are relatively a safer investment in the short term and a more attractive investment in the longer term, which is the way we feel as well, I have to tell you, just about our own investment. So I think there is a lot of pent-up demand among financial institutions to go into real state. You've read a lot about this, I'm sure, and it's been all over the press. And I think they're for the reasons that I'm describing, it makes a lot of sense for those investors to get out of the relatively weak economies that they are in, both in Asia and in Europe, to get into the relatively stronger economy, even though the yields are lower than they used to be comparatively, in terms of both the security of the principal and the longer-term possibility of depreciation. They are very attractive investments for foreign funds.","Unknown Analyst","Would you include developments as a possibility within a joint venture structure? Or would you envisage continuing to do that purely on balance sheet?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I think, frankly, we would probably focus more on investment properties with partners. But we would -- depending on the kind of an investment it was, we would be open to a partnership even on developments. But that's a much more difficult thing to explain and to assess and to evaluate. We -- that's what we've done for so many years, I mean, how many decades have we been in it. And that's something we're more comfortable with. They are, by and large, more comfortable in investment properties where there have -- there's a lot easier challenge to figuring out what they think the income would be in the shorter term, the medium term and longer term.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Doug, can I come to you -- I think I picked out the word -- you used sluggish space demand in some of your prepared remarks. I just wonder what your outlook is for leasing CapEx. Do you think we can hold at these levels in your market? Or do you think we\u2019re going to come under some pressure in that regard?","Douglas T. Linde","I think that, for the most part, if you want to increase velocity or shall I say, if we want to increase velocity, what we have found is that we have to invest more capital into our spaces earlier. And so you are seeing us with a preponderance of investments into some of these pre-billed suite opportunities and buildings like 510 Madison and 599 Lex and 540 Madison, soon to be as SAC moves out of the base of that building. And I think that involves more capital than you would be putting in on a \"negotiated lease basis.\" So if a turnkey installation on a small fleet is $85 a square foot, that's $20 -- $10 or $20 a square foot more. The reason that we do that is we make a decision that we thing we're going to improve the velocity of the leasing significantly, and so instead of having to wait 12 months, we only have to wait 3 months because we've taken care of the build-out time and we've only had to put $10 or $20 a square foot more into the space. That's the type of, I'd say, increase in capital expenditures we are seeing on the leasing side. We are not seeing a weakness in the market, whereby there is a significant increase in the overall availability of space in any of our markets, which are leading landlords to provide much greater concession packages than they would have 6 months or 9 months ago.","Unknown Analyst","And by definition, I suppose there are far fewer people who are -- have got such access to capital that can compete with you in putting so much capital upfront in deals.","Douglas T. Linde","It would be nice to believe that. I think there continue to be some significantly well-capitalized competitors of ours in our markets that are prepared to do similar types of transactions, although, they may be more reluctant to do it than we are, and therefore, that's why we're having as much success as we're having.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Douglas T. Linde","I think that ends our comments. We thank you for being patient and holding your summer plans until this week. We wish you all a happy and enjoyable couple of weeks until we get back in September. We will, I promise you, not be all going on summer vacation. We'll still be leasing space and looking for acquisitions and trying to get developments going even as the...","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","He doesn't mean to say that we're going to be doing that while you're all on vacation.","Douglas T. Linde","But we will talk to you again in the early fall. Thanks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Thank you all.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a good day."],"3537":["Boston Properties, Inc.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista and good morning to everyone. On current results, our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.05 above our prior forecast and $0.05 above Street consensus, due primarily to operational outperformance. We also has a result increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.04.","We\u2019ve leased approximately 2.8 million square feet year-to-date in our portfolio. This includes 926,000 square feet in the second quarter and approximately 1.3 million square feet of leasing already in the third quarter, including a renewal of Estee Lauder at the General Motors Building, as well as lease with Marriott, which commences the development of their new headquarters.","Our in-service office portfolio occupancy increased to 90.8%, up 40 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strongly positive rent roll ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross and 28% on a net basis compared to the prior lease.","Lastly, year-to-date, we\u2019ve raised significant new capital and either commenced or secured nearly $1 billion in new developments, the office components of which are fully leased.","So moving to the economic environment, the tepid yet consistent growth of the U.S. economy continues and as a constructive force for our business. U.S. GDP growth picked up in the second quarter, as current estimates are 2.6%. The employment picture also continues to be healthy with 222,000 jobs created in June and the unemployment rate steady at 4.4%.","Though the Fed has hiked rates three times since December and continues to signal more is coming, the capital markets are diverging as the ten year U.S. Treasury remained low at 2.3% and has dropped approximately 15 basis points year-to-date, and 10 basis points since the end of the first quarter.","Given continued muted growth low inflation and the uncertainty associated with Federal stimulus and tax cuts, we are not overly concerned about a sharp rise in the long-term interest rates and anticipate for now a continuation of reasonably healthy operating and financial market conditions.","Given the growth in the U.S. economy, the office markets where we operate have positive demand and healthy activity, but are in relative equilibrium given additions to supply. Job creation in our five markets grew 2.1% over the last year versus the national average of 1%. In the CBDs of our four core markets and West L.A., net absorption year-to-date is 1.3 million square feet or 0.2% of stock, while additions to supply year-to-date have been 2.2 million square feet or 0.3% of stock. Asking rents rose 2.6% in the first half of 2017, while vacancy stayed flat at 8.1%. Our leasing activity remains active with pockets of strength, though concessions are rising in specific market.","In the private real estate capital market, our commercial real estate transactions year-to-date through July are down 20% and a little less for office, but there continues to be a strong bid from both domestic and non-U.S. investors in size for high quality office assets in our core markets, and the international sources of capital continue to rotate geographically.","Cap rates have remain stable for high quality office buildings in our portfolio generally in the low 4% range for stabilized properties. Once again, this past quarter several significant office transactions were completed above replacement costs. And some of these examples are in Santa Monica, Arboretum Courtyard, a 147,000 square foot office building is under contract for $1,030 a square foot and a 4% cap to a domestic real estate adviser.","Also in LA, 9665 Wilshire Boulevard is a 171,000 square foot office building located in Beverly Hill, sold for $1,035 a square foot and a 4.1% cap rate to a domestic REIT partnered with non-U.S. capital.","Moving to Boston, 75 Arlington and 10 St James in the Back Bay, which collectively comprise 825,000 square feet were sold for $816 a foot and a 4.3% cap rate to a Japanese investment firm marking its first U.S. real estate investment.","Lastly, in Washington DC, 900 16th Street and 1101 New York Avenue were sold for $1,150 a square foot and around a 4% cap rate on a blended basis to a partnership of non-U.S. investors. The pricing for 900 16th Street is $1,254 a square foot, which represents a new high in pricing for Washington DC.","So let me bring all this together and discuss our current capital allocation posture. On the positive side, economic growth, job creation and leasing demand are steady with no visible catalyst for correction and interest rates appear benign at least in the near-term. In addition, private capital demand remains strong for high quality office assets in our market.","On the risk side, supply is increasing in a handful of our markets with rising tenant concessions, and there is the continuing backdrop of macro risk, including global hot spot and unpredictable outcomes from Federal Legislators. We therefore remain cautiously constructive and will continue to invest capital selectively in new development and existing assets that we can improve.","However, the risk tolerance bar continues to be raised, we are requiring material preleasing for new development and keeping our leverage relatively low in the event of a correction and a resultant more robust opportunity set. And disposition decisions are driven by achieving attractive pricing for non-core assets.","So moving to the execution of our capital strategy and starting with acquisitions, we completed a small 96,000 square foot bolt-on purchase for $16 million of one of the few office buildings we don\u2019t own at Carnegie Center at an attractive price and something that we can efficiently manage. We are looking for new investments in all our four core markets as well as LA given our desire to build on our presence in that market.","As an aside on acquisitions, Mike will talk about a financing we\u2019re completing on Colorado Center, which was appraised for $1.2 billion as part of the financing process. We bought a 50% interest in the property the valuation of $1 billion just over a year ago.","On dispositions, this past quarter we sell the building and related site on Shattuck Road in Andover, Mass in two transactions for total proceeds of $17 million. This asset is non-core and has a remote location relative to our Suburban Boston portfolio. We have a small number of non-core assets either in the market or planned for sale in the Washington DC region and Suburban Boston, our target for dispositions for 2017 remains at approximately $200 million.","Our development activity remains robust, we delivered reservoir place north of 73,000 square foot redevelopment in Waltham, Mass, where we have a letter of intent with a full building user. We commenced 145 Broadway, Akamai\u2019s 485,000 square foot headquarters at Kendall Square in Cambridge and MacArthur Transit Village of 402 unit residential high-rise located adjacent to the MacArthur BART station in Oakland, California.","And last week, we signed a 720,000 square foot lease with Marriott to commence their new headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. We own 50% of this project with a local landowner. These three deals alone represent $815 million in new investment for us at a projected cash yield of approximately 7% and the commercial component is essentially fully preleased.","Further, we\u2019ve made significant progress advancing a 300,000 square foot anchor lease commitment for our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development in Washington DC and are working on multiple build to suite leased opportunities precisely own in Northern Virginia. These transactions could add over 1 million square feet of leasing for 2017 and several significant investments to our development pipeline if completed.","At the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline consists of eight new projects and two redevelopments totaling 4.7 million square feet and 2.9 billion in our share of projected costs of which $1.5 billion has been funded through the end of the second quarter. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments remains in excess of 7% and the preleasing of the commercial component increased 12% in the quarter to 66%.","So to conclude, we continue to be confident about our prospects for growth and ability to create shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We\u2019re making good progress on our clearly communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through new development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. This growth excludes our recent new business wins and potential new investments for which we have significant capacity.","So let me turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thank you, Owen. Good morning everybody. I\u2019m going to start, just a little bit of color on our same-store statistics. So we had a pretty healthy increase as Owen described in that same-store portfolio. And remember, those are the leases that commenced this quarter, those are not necessarily leases that were signed this quarter. So let me just give you a color on that pool.","So in Boston, there was about 370,000 square feet in the same-store, in the Putnam transaction, which we completed over a year ago at 100 Federal Street is finally coming into play. Again it\u2019s sort of one of those things where we talked about a repositioning we talked about leases that were signed and we had to be patient about when that revenue was going to come in, but the revenue is there.","In San Francisco, there\u2019s about 230,000 square feet from Embarcadero Center, and it\u2019s really just a continuation there of all the renewals and relocations that we\u2019ve executed over the past 12 plus months, where we\u2019re seeing those roll ups of between 40% and 50% on a gross basis and in excess of 60% on a net basis.","In New York City, there\u2019s about 300,000 square feet and that includes \u2013 actually a deal that we did back in 2014 at 601 Lexington Avenue with a major law firm, which again had a big increase and it\u2019s showing up this quarter. And then Washington DC which was on the negative side, there\u2019s about 127,000 square feet of space in Northern Virginia and the biggest deal there was actually a law firm renewal that was done in the beginning of 2016, where there was a pretty small downtick, it was about $0.65 a square foot and that lease had 2.5% escalators and it\u2019s for 12 years. And remember, all of these numbers that we\u2019ve described are the first year rent versus the last year rent on a cash basis.","So to the extent, there are GAAP increases which there are in virtually every one of our leases those are not reflected in these same-store numbers. If you look at our TI numbers, they popped up a little bit this quarter too. And I think that\u2019s the trend we\u2019ve been seeing. The construction industry continued to be very busy in all of our markets and its resulting in increased in base building we budget those accurately. And it\u2019s also impacting tenant improvement installations.","Tenants are investing more capital on the improvement and we are investing more capital in their spaces. This is an across the board reality in San Francisco, in Boston, in New York City, in DC, in Los Angeles, and it\u2019s urban and suburban. And I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a result of three factors. First, higher production costs, which is costing more because people are very busy. Two, there are increase code related issues, Title 24 in San Francisco being the easiest one to describe. And then third, we\u2019re competing in all of our second generation space with new construction, and new constructions typically offer significant amounts of tenant improvement and it\u2019s just part of the supply dynamics that we are dealing with across the board.","So in some cases, we\u2019re increasing our allowances. In some cases where prebuilding space which we\u2019ve described to you before, and in other cases, we\u2019re providing turnkey installations. Rents and other concessions, however, really have been pretty steady over the past number of quarters.","I\u2019m going to start my regional comments this morning, in San Francisco with Salesforce Tower. So last quarter, we announced a 100,000 square feet of leasing and I discussed active proposal that we were talking to with a number of tenants. Well, guess what? In the second quarter, we leased another 175,000 square feet brings us to 1.135 million square feet leased, 82% and we are in lease negotiations on five more floors totaling another 116,000 square feet. And then last week, we received offer on another 4.5.","To current discussions involved law firms and co-working firms and private equity firms and hedge funds and private foundations and venture capital firms and even some sovereign wealth advisors. If we complete the deal just in lease negotiation will be left with two 10,000 square foot spaces and floors 51 through 56, a 130,000 square feet, or it will be over 90% leased.","The available space is priced at over $100 growth. Now in spite of all the talk over the past year about the overhang of the new construction in San Francisco, the overall market continues to improve. While there haven\u2019t been any blockbuster deals Amazon this quarter took another 175,000 square feet, Cloudera took 55,000 square feet, Airbnb expanded again bringing their net absorption just this year to 250,000 square feet.","And we are aware of five active requirements in excess of 100,000 square feet in the market, and they are all focusing on new construction since it\u2019s the only large block option. Sublet space inventory has shrunk. The top 25 sublet spaces make up about 625,000 square feet and there are only two spaces above 50,000 square feet. And this compares to 1 million square feet in the second quarter of 2016, a big reduction. We tracked more than 20 deals with rent over $80 a square foot gross this quarter and the new construction pricing is high 80s growth and up.","Last quarter, I said that the story to follow in San Francisco, CBD will be the continued demand growth and tenants respond to the price of new construction. Tenants are accepting the higher pricing in the market. We completed nine deals for 73,000 square feet of office leasing at Estee this quarter and we have three more full floor deals in negotiation and we have active proposals for another six floors, including the space set to expire in 2018 from Bain Capital or Bain consulting that\u2019s moving over to Salesforce Tower by the end of this year.","We completed a 62,000 square foot deal at Colorado Center this quarter bringing our committed space to 93%. We have proposals ongoing on the last piece of space there, so I\u2019ll tell you that our view of the overall leasing velocity in the LA market particularly in the West LA market has moderated. There were very few large deals completed in the second quarter and the same tenants are in the market with the same availabilities in play.","Our repositioning plans are close to complete and we are working with the local permitting authority with a goal of commencing construction on the amenities work by the end of this year. Shifting to the other side of the country in Boston. We\u2019ve made significant progress on our availability at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon. In the second quarter, we signed 83,000 square feet of leases and since the beginning of July, we\u2019ve signed another 51,000 square feet and has 54,000 under negotiation, all of the space at 120 St. James is committed.","We\u2019ve executed our first prebuilt at 200 Clarendon on the 45th floor, which will be completed in the third quarter and we are in lease with a second user. Down the Street at 888 Boylston Street, during the quarter, we completed the leasing on all of the remaining retail space, 17,000 square feet, and additional leasing in the office tower, leaving us with 30,000 square feet in this 417,000 square foot project nine months after opening, 92.8% leased.","While there are not a lot of large exploration driven requirements of the Boston CBD at the moment, we have seen the growth activity picking up. Amazon grew by 150,000 square feet in July in the Seaport, and we are in active dialogue with six tenants, four from the technology industry, ranging from 30,000 square feet to 175,000 square feet for the 175,000 square feet space at the Hub on Causeway that we\u2019ll deliver in the first half of 2019.","Overall, in the CBD market, rents are stable though depending upon the condition of the space, the landlord\u2019s contribution to tenant improvements has risen as I said at the outset of my comments. In our Waltham suburban portfolio, our largest executed transaction involved the recapturing and releasing of 40,000 square feet at our Reservoir Place asset. We also have, as Owen said, a lease under negotiation with a tenant for the entirety of 73,000 square feet at Reservoir Place North.","We continue to see growth from life science companies, and we actually completed another 25,000 square foot expansion at Bay Colony with an organization that has grown from 13,000 square feet in sublet space in 2001, to a 150,000 square feet of direct space today. We responded to two new additional build to suit proposals at our CityPoint landholdings, though as Owen stated, our leasing thresholds are very high. If we are able to land a major lease commitment, this would add to our investment pipeline for 2020 and beyond. And if any of these projects go forward, the rents will be in excess of $50 a square foot gross.","We\u2019ve commenced the marketing of that 100,000 square feet of space. We\u2019re going to getting back in Cambridge in early 2018 Our 2.4 million square foot portfolio, which is 100% leased, is dominated by large users. We\u2019ve received a very strong interest from co-working operators that find us location on the top of the Kendall Square T station to be an ideal spot for small tenant opportunities, which are lacking in Cambridge. We are exploring this news for a portion of the space. This space also has its own dedicated entrance if a user is interested in expressing its brand. The Cambridge office and lab markets continue to be very tight and expensive, forcing tenants to consider alternative locations like The Hub on Causeway project.","Last quarter, I commented that our large tenant at the General Motors Building with a 2020 lease exploration had been actively evaluating their alternatives. Well, as Owen stated, Estee Lauder has made a long-term commitment to the building. In addition to the location, and the view, the building infrastructure, we believe one of the strong selling points for Estee Lauder was our ability to provide flexibility as they move forward with rebuilding and replanning their space, facilitated by the use of two swing force.","They are currently in 295,000 square feet and have committed to 220,000 square feet with rights to expand. This was an important transaction for the building as it is a great tenant and at limits available space for some time. As I\u2019ve said before, the issue with the high-end market is not pricing, it\u2019s the depth of the market, and there is a more high-end the space entering the market as we speak.","This quarter, we were encouraged as there were more relocations over $100 than there have been in recent memory. Now this is due directly to the new construction on the west side at the Hudson Yards and 1 Manhattan Place \u2013 excuse me, 1 Manhattan West, which complete the deals. During the first half of 2017, so the first six months, there were 30 deals at 19 distinct buildings, above $100 a square foot in starting rent and the average deal size increase to 20,000 square feet. There were five deals between 40,000 square feet and 90,000 square feet. Size of deals is still the issue.","With the execution of our renewal at the General Motors Building, our biggest exposure in New York City are at 399 Park Avenue and 159 East 53rd Street. Activity at 399 Park is good. We have leases in negotiation right now for 66,000 square feet and we are in discussions with three medium sized financial service organization between 150,000 square feet and 250,000 square feet of our low rise space, which encompasses 250,000 square feet. Obviously, we can do all those deals. And we have a steady stream of tours and proposals on the individual tower floors, which begin on 18th in the building up to the 35th floor.","Our low rice space on Park Avenue is priced in the mid-$80s to the low-$90s. So repeating what we said last quarter, in 2017, we\u2019re collecting $31 million from the expiring tenants at 399 Park. We\u2019re going to get the space back during the third quarter. We\u2019re making proposals. We\u2019re going to lease the space consistent with these economics I just described, but in every case, we\u2019re going to have to demolish the existing improvements and occupancy will not be until 2019, which will mean that this space will not generate any revenue in 2018. And it\u2019s going to show up as a decline in our same-store growth.","Same-store, just repeating it, from last quarter. At 159 East 53rd Street, which is currently out of service, the new curtain wall is being hung as we speak, go over to Third Avenue, look up and you\u2019ll see the brand-new building. We\u2019ve made a number of proposals on 195,000 square feet of office space that is being rebuilt and will be delivered in early 2018.","We\u2019re optimistic that we will have signed leases in place contemporaneously with the base building completion, and revenue recognition will be in 2019. We are marketing a new building with a great new enhanced window line, mechanical plant and tremendous outdoor space on each floor at a great relative value.","Often during the summer, we describe a hiatus in activity as vacations impact individual transactions. This year, we have pushed through this pause in San Francisco, we pushed through in New York and we pushed through in Boston. So the summer slowdown seems to have impacted the DC spot market, in the CBD. In the DC CBD, the spot leasing market continues to be a challenge with significant available inventory in existing assets, and as a number of brokerage reports have pointed out, availability from new construction of partially leased buildings.","Concessions are generous and additional GSA, contractor, law firm or other private- sector demand has yet to pick up in DC. Nonetheless, this quarter, we had a lot of activity in DC. The majority of it on the operating front was focused a Capital Gallery, which is a 99% lease building and where we did six renewals totaling 53,000 square-feet. And in Northern Virginia, where we completed 120,000 square feet including a full building, user 63,000 square feet in our VA 95 Park and in Reston Town Center, we have 45,000 square feet of leases under negotiation on vacant space and Discovery Square, which expired in June, about 38 days ago.","Under negotiation, all of it, which would bring us to 98% leased, and there are number of technology companies looking to expand in Reston Town Center just as the defense contractors have begun to retreat. As evidenced by the Marriott lease, the progress we\u2019re making at 2100 Penn, with a 300,000 square foot lead tenant as Owen described, and a recent build to suit requirement in excess of 600,000 square-feet that we are hotly pursuing in Reston Town Center, our new transaction activity is a robust as it has been in our history and it involves very little speculative space.","I want to conclude my remarks this morning with a portfolio comment. We\u2019ve been conducting major capital reposition activities across the portfolio that have impacted the availability of significant space. 399 Park, 601 Lexington Avenue, the General Motors retail, the Prudential Center retail, 120 St. James, Reservoir Place North and 181 Spring Street in Suburban Boston and 100 Federal Street. These assets are all part of the revenue bridge, operating or development, and we\u2019ve been discussing them over the last 18 months on a continual basis.","Moving forward, the only buildings in the portfolio planned for future repositioning, but not actively underway, where our activities could impact tenant space are at Metropolitan Square, where we own 20%, and 1333 New Hampshire. Both of these buildings are in Washington, DC. The buildings have known 2019 lease expirations. Our current share of the annualized NOI impact from the future rollover in lease assets is $13.8 million, pretty modest. We will continue to make other capital investments across the portfolio as we rebuild generators, and elevator controls, and lobby finishes, put new roofs on, and all other kinds of building systems, but there are no building project in the portfolio where we expect tenant spaces to be impacted.","At the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve now completed leases that we expect will add $69 million to our goal of $160 million, which includes all the releasing at 399 Park, for net growth of $111 million of annualized in-service NOI, our revenue bridge. And finally, we\u2019ve added 350 basis points to our development pipeline, where 70.6% where we anticipate a 2020 annualized incremental NOI of $242 million stabilized versus year-end 2015.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","All right, thanks, Doug. I\u2019m going to get started with a discussion of our results for the quarter. Our top line revenue growth was strong this quarter and is reflected in an increase in net operating income from the portfolio of $14 million, net of termination income. We gained 40 basis points of occupancy, which included significant gains at 100 Federal Street and 200 Clarendon Street in Boston, 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City, and our Suburban Washington, DC. Portfolio, mostly from leases that were signed in previous quarters and what revenue has now commenced.","This also shows up in our same-store results for the quarter, with our share of same property NOI up nicely at 3.9% versus last year. In June, we closed our $2.3 billion 10 year refinancing of the GM Building at a GAAP interest rate of 3.64%. The repayment of the existing debt resulted in a noncash gain on debt extinguishment this quarter of $14.6 million.","This was in our guidance and I spoke about it last quarter. It is from the acceleration of fair value interest and is now cleaned up and will not recur. Since it is related to a consolidated joint venture, our share is $9 million with the offset in our noncontrolling interest line.","As I mentioned last quarter, the loss of noncash fair value interest will increase our interest expense going forward. In 2018, we project our interest expense to be between $390 million and $410 million compared to our 2017 guidance of $355 million to $368 million. This represents an increase in interest expense of $38 million or $0.22 per share in 2018 at the midpoint, which you should reflect in your models.","For our earnings, we had a solid quarter and reported funds from operations of $0.67 per share, this was $8.5 million or $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. $0.02 per share of the improvement is due to expenses that were deferred to later in the year. So we anticipate only $0.03 per share will flow into our full-year\u2019s results. The remaining $0.03 was comprised of $0.02 per share of earlier than projected leasing, primarily in Boston and San Francisco. At 200 Clarendon Street in Boston, we continue seeing uptick in activity and are successfully converting proposals to signed leases and getting tenants in the occupancy as quickly as we can.","Similarly, at Embarcadero Center, we gained occupancy again this quarter and executed another full floor renewal with a strong rental increase. In Mountain View, we signed a lease with a tenant for immediate occupancy at a 70% increase in net rent over the prior lease. None of the outperformance in the portfolio this quarter is from termination income. We did record $11.5 million in termination income this quarter, being our share, this is primarily from terminations at 399 Park Avenue and the GM Building that we discussed last quarter and were in our guidance.","The other increase to our anticipated results this quarter was in development and management services fee income where we recorded revenue approximately $0.01 ahead of our expectations. The variance was mostly in-service income and development fees. Based upon the leasing that we completed this quarter and that we project for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re increasing our assumptions for 2017 same-property NOI growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint to between 2% and 3% compared to 2016.","Most of the improvement is coming from leasing velocity in San Francisco, and Boston as well as in New York, where we completed our early renewal with Estee Lauder. Although our current same-property growth pace exceeds 3%, as Doug described, we expect our same property growth will decelerate in the back half of 2017 due to lower occupancy from lease expirations at 399 Park Avenue.","Most of our second quarter uptick in leasing came from new leases with free rent periods and early renewals with rent increases, which flow into our straight-line rent. This is reflected in our new guidance for straight-line rent and fair value rental income of $75 million to $85 million for 2017 that represents an increase of $5 million at the midpoint from last quarter.","We\u2019re also increasing our guidance for development and management services income based upon the results of the second quarter, and we now project $30 million to $33 million in fee income for 2017. We have not changed our guidance range for interest expense, though the financing of Colorado Center this quarter is dilutive to our 2017 earnings and will reduce our income from joint ventures by about $4 million. The loss is partially offset by expected lower borrowing under our line of credit and higher interest income. The anticipated net loss to our budget is about $0.01 per share.","So in summary, we are increasing our guidance for 2017 funds from operations to $6.20 to $6.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint that represents an increase of $0.04 per share from improvement and portfolio NOI, $0.01 per share from management and development services income, offset by a reduction of a $0.01 per share from our financing activities.","As Owen mentioned, we added three additional developments to our pipeline, totaling nearly $815 million of new investment, and I want to make a few comments on our funding capacity and plans. Our development pipeline now totals $3.1 billion and has additional funding of approximately $1.5 billion remaining.","At quarter end, we had a cash position of approximately $500 million and we have full availability under our bank line of credit and term loan facilities totaling $2 billion. Last week, we closed a 10 year fixed rate mortgage on our Colorado Center property located in Santa Monica. The loan in the amount of $550 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.56%.","The property is held in a 50-50 joint venture, it was previously unencumbered and we received a distribution of $250 million, adding to our liquidity. Since acquiring Colorado Center in the third quarter last year, we have leased more than 300,000 square feet, bringing the leasing up from 65% to 93%. Our LA team has done a phenomenal job and we\u2019re significantly exceeding our original underwriting projections both in terms of lease-up timing and stabilized projected income contribution.","Upon full lease-up and stabilization, we project an unleveraged cash return of approximately 5.8%, and after rolling up existing below-market leases, we expected to get to the mid-6% range. With long-term financing at 3.56%, the equity returns are even stronger. We have now accessed over $4.8 billion in the debt markets in 2017, demonstrating the strong support we have in the capital markets.","We also expect to raise approximately $225 million of construction financing, representing our share to finance a portion of the cost of The Hub on Causeway and Marriott developments. Overall, we have plenty of resources in the form of liquidity and debt facilities to fund our pipeline. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our balance sheet is strong with relatively low leverage, that provides more than sufficient capacity to fund these as well as additional investments without raising common equity.","Lastly, I just want to remind everyone that we\u2019re having our investor conference this fall. The date is on October 4, and it will be in Boston with a formal presentation starting at 8:00 AM. We will also be doing property tours on the afternoon of October 3, and hosting a cocktail party that evening. You should have received a save the date already and a formal invitation will come out soon. We look forward to seeing you all there and as always, we appreciate your support. That completes our formal remarks.","Operator, you can open up the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first call is from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Hey, good morning guys. You described a lot of good recent in pending leasing activity at Salesforce Tower. Just curious if you can explain briefly the drivers behind pushing that stabilization date out a couple quarters?","Owen Thomas","So the \u2013 on the stabilization, we have gotten, I guess, information from Salesforce on their planned phasing in. So as the building gets closer to completion, it\u2019s going to complete at the end of this year. Salesforce has basically six phases of work that they are putting into place and we can start revenue recognition on the space when they complete their TIs. So basically, they\u2019re going to start moving into the building at the beginning of 2018 and over six quarters, they\u2019re going to phase in to these six phases.","So the last quarter of their move-in is going to be at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019. I would say that they are paying us cash rent before they\u2019re actually physically occupying the space because the way the lease works, there are set dates in the lease for each phase when they have to start paying cash rent.","So we\u2019re actually going to be putting a bunch of deferred revenue up on our balance sheet as they pay cash rent and before they occupy, because we can\u2019t recognize the revenue. And then when they occupy each phase, we will recognize all that deferred revenue over the term of the lease. So our cash will be coming in earlier. It\u2019s just we won\u2019t be able to recognize it as revenue.","Jed Reagan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And you mentioned that pre-leasing requirements have increased recently for developments. I was just wondering if you can quantify where you\u2019d peg that today versus maybe what that threshold was, say, a year or two ago?","Owen Thomas","So, Jed, it\u2019s hard \u2013 it\u2019s Owen, it\u2019s hard to give you an exact number on that, it depends on a lot of factors. What\u2019s the size of the building, what\u2019s \u2013 how active is the current market, what is the kind of leasing dialogues that we\u2019ve had, but as an example several years ago, we launched 535 Mission in San Francisco on a spec basis, we probably wouldn\u2019t do something like that today. And also as an example, most of the transactions that you\u2019re seeing us do today, they\u2019re substantially, if not fully pre-let, so we\u2019ve announced recently Akamai\u2019s headquarters, fully pre-let, Marriott\u2019s headquarters, fully pre-let. We talked about the 300,000-foot anchor commitment were trying to secure at 2100 Pennsylvania. So it\u2019s hard to give you an exact number. It depends on a lot of factors but we want significant pre-letting in our new developments.","Doug Linde","I\u2019ll give you a real life example. So the tenant that Owen and I described is looking at Reservoir Place North at 72,000 square feet. They asked us for proposal for the next building at City Place and we said we weren\u2019t going to give them a proposal because 73,000 square feet or 80,000 square feet or a 200,000 square-feet building was not enough for us to deem it appropriate to start that building.","Jed Reagan","Okay, appreciate that. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Just turning to the Estee Lauder renewal. Could you just explain when the shrinkage of this space happens and what year? And your comfort level in taking back 75-year \u2013 and your comfort level in taking back 75,000 square foot of space along with, what type of package you have to offer to keep the tenant rather than have him go to somewhere else. Let\u2019s start with that. Thanks.","Owen Thomas","So let me start, and I\u2019ll let John Powers chime in. So Estee Lauder has a lease through at the beginning \u2013 middle of 2020, and that lease is remaining in place. And they signed an extension on 220,000 square feet and we will begin to provide them with some swing space sometime towards the end of \u2013 or middle to end of 2018. So they can start their work. And I\u2019ll let John keep going from there.","John Powers","Well, I don\u2019t have too much to add. They may in fact increase their square footage over the next period of time. We don\u2019t really know that. They have flexibility take significantly more space.","Nick Yulico","Okay. As far as the rents, I mean, is this rolls down on rents flat. How should we think about that?","Owen Thomas","You should think about it as follows. When we bought the building back in 2008, there were two leases that were very, very, very billable market, and one of them was Wild [indiscernible] the other one was Aramis, Estee Lauder. We were able to keep both of those tenants in the building and we will be able to offer those tenants really attractive lease rates. That were probably lower than what we would charge a tenant that was taking 15,000 square feet or 20,000 square feet or 30,000 square feet in the building. And so it was a win-win situation for both parties.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just last question, you talked about some of the activity at 399 Park and the low rise of 601 Lex. Sounds like the activity there is pretty good. How do you feeling about getting leasing announced before year-end for the bulk of the space for both buildings?","Owen Thomas","John, you want to take that one.","John Powers","Well, we have some good prospects. We\u2019re trading papers. So we\u2019re optimistic we could have it done by recent, but maybe it will drift into the first quarter. These are big leases and after you have a term sheet. It\u2019s typically 90 days to get it signed. So we do have good interest. On the three prospects that Doug mentioned, the 399, they\u2019re all on different time frames. So one of them probably would certainly be done by the end of the year, the others probably would be in the first quarter.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks, John and Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. So I just wanted to dig in a bit into your comments around the high-end of the market, you mentioned pricing is not an issue, but the depth and maybe just private tenancies. Can maybe just give a little bit more color. What you seen exactly at some of the higher-end space, maybe a 399 Park and some of the tenants that are looking at some of the floors that are at vacant in the GM Building?","Mike LaBelle","Do you want to start with that one, John, and then I\u2019ll add to color this time?","John Powers","Sure. I think we have some good activity at the GM Building. It\u2019s funding in the market is, as Doug said, pretty flat in terms of the pricing today and it\u2019s more pressure on the TI dollars, but there\u2019s a pretty good activity. So we have a floor and a part of the floor available. So we have two or three tenants looking at that at GM. We had two or three tenants looking at the four floors, or more than four floors in the Tower at 399.","Owen Thomas","And again, just \u2013 this is sort of my market commentary. There are lots of tenants, who are prepared to pay in excess of $100 a square foot to be in, as I described, the 19 buildings that may deal this quarter. The challenge in the market in Manhattan is that, the tenants that\u2019s paying well in excess of $100 a square foot is a smaller tenant.","And so, it\u2019s a question just of the size of that pool relative to the amount of square footage that is coming onto the market over time. And I think that is where the rubber is going to meet the road. They will continue to be, and we believe lots of single floor and two-floor deals, and 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 or maybe even some 80,000 or 90,000 square foot deals.","It\u2019s hard to imagine there being hundreds of thousands of square feet of leases from single tenants in the marketplace that well in excess of $100 a square foot in the current environment. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen in three or four years, but in the current environment, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, and just to clarify, on the GM \u2013 on the Estee Lauder space, you mentioned that there will be some swing space. Are they taking some lower floors while you redevelop some stuff? Can you just maybe walk us through how that will work?","Owen Thomas","Sure. Go ahead, John.","John Powers","Yes. You noticed, I think it was last quarter, we took some termination income at GM. And we did that to provide swing space for Estee Lauder to swing through the building. They need at least two floors to rebuild as they go through their space.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. So thank you.","John Powers","So just understand this process will take them about three years to do and they\u2019ll be making decisions on which brands to keep there, and which ones to move. So we won\u2019t know the answer to exactly how much of space they take for probably another year or two.","Vikram Malhotra","But as of now, they\u2019ve committed to roughly 50,000 left space, is that correct?","Doug Linde","That\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve given them a lot of flexibility, because they are repositioning their whole portfolio and they have a number of different brands and there\u2019s a lot of completed decisions that they have to make. So we decided to go in early, get this deal done and allow them the flexibility. So the commitment they\u2019ve made is the minimum commitment. That maybe the final commitment, but as I said, things will change over the next two years.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Good morning, everyone. Maybe if we turn to LA for second, it\u2019s a market that you\u2019ve had some successful leasing at Colorado. What do you see in terms of other opportunities there and would you stay sort of in that West LA submarket or would you go a little bit broader?","Owen Thomas","We have been \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, growing LA is the priority for us. We\u2019ve had initial success with Colorado Center and we want to build on our toehold there. We have been looking and studying a number of new investments, some of them have been offered by intermediaries, more broadly, and some of them are more private discussions, some of them are acquisitions, some are development and redevelopment. We\u2019re continuing to track \u2013 I\u2019d say probably a little under half a dozen things at this point. The perimeter is more or less consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about, which is more West LA, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, El Segundo, those kinds of areas as opposed to downtown.","And \u2013 but again, as we did with Colorado Center, we\u2019re not trying to grow just for growth\u2019s sake. We want to, in addition to growing, we want to make money for shareholders in the process and we feel, we did that on Colorado Center and that\u2019s our bar for new investments.","Manny Korchman","Great. And then maybe, Mike or Doug, if we turn back to your slides that you presented at NAREIT, has anything changed in terms of timing there either from the contribution from the developments or sort of the expectations of when NOI kicks in from the projects outlined there?","Doug Linde","Honestly, Manny, the only thing that\u2019s changed is the developments have kind of gone up slightly I think it was 241 and not 242 or 243. So it\u2019s gone up a little bit, because we\u2019re, honestly, we\u2019re able to achieve more income from Salesforce Tower than we originally thought we would. But, again, we were very circumspect about the specific timing of our development in terms of when it was going to be put in services and it\u2019s the first question this morning addressed that the timing of the income from the largest tenant at Salesforce Tower is just \u2013 it\u2019s not in our discretion. We know when the cash is coming in, but we don\u2019t know when the revenue recognitions are going to occur.","Manny Korchman","Got it. And final one for me, just \u2013 could you share your thoughts on your Street retail, it\u2019s been a big topic of discussion and especially maybe as you\u2019re leasing up at 399 and other places?","Doug Linde","I\u2019ll make one comment, and then I\u2019ll let John respond. So our Street retail is a pretty de minimis amount of square footage, although it has a lot of value. And we have a couple of spaces on Madison Avenue, and we\u2019re in reasonable constructive conversations with a few tenants there. And then the bulk of our retail in Manhattan is about food and \"lifestyle choices\" AKA, what we\u2019re doing at 601 Lexington Avenue with our repositioning of the retail there, and I\u2019ll let John describe what\u2019s going on there.","John Powers","Well, we\u2019re repositioning the base of 601. As you know, putting in a food hall there and we\u2019re out to lease with a, let\u2019s say, a master retailer that would run the whole food hall for us. I guess, the retail in Manhattan, as Doug said, we don\u2019t have a big exposure. Clearly, the market is soft in many places.","Manny Korchman","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Thanks, guys, good morning. Just curious, your commentary about TIs going up, kind of rents staying in place. Just kind of curious how that dovetails to the type of yield you guys are expecting on some of these build to suit developments? I mean, where should we expect those returns come in versus maybe 12 to 18 months ago?","Doug Linde","Well, we mentioned in our remarks that the new developments that we are adding, we believe on pro forma basis, are going to yield for the company roughly a 7% cash yield. And that has more or less been our target for commercial development. We\u2019ve been through that from time to time, if we have material preleasing, and frankly, we\u2019ve achieved better than that. So I think the yields have stayed relatively constant. I think that\u2019s logical given where interest rates have stayed. I think of the development, the risk bar has really gone up more on the preleasing \u2013 with our preleasing requirement, which we talked about further. And then on residential, the yields are probably 100 basis points lower in general, when we look at new development.","Craig Mailman","That\u2019s helpful. And then, just turning to kind of co-working space, you guys \u2013 WeWork\u2019s at about 83 bps plus what\u2019s coming on at Dock72. And you guys are talking about, I\u2019m also looking up in the Boston area or co-working tenant looking up in the Boston area. Just curious, how much exposure you guys want to that kind of vertical from a tenant perspective?","Doug Linde","Let me try and describe the answer to your question in a couple of ways. So number one, we are affirmatively believers that co-working and the aggregation of small tenant users is a good thing for the market, and it\u2019s a good thing for our properties. And so we have been very accommodative and outward in terms of being receptive to those types of users. There are a whole host of these organizations now. Some of them will not be successful and some of them will be very successful. Obviously, we have a position with WeWork, from a tenant perspective, we don\u2019t, we have no investment and we work as an equity owner and we\u2019ve had that question before.","And we have been pretty dogmatic about modest amounts of tenant improvement exposure there and high-quality secure deposits in the form of LCs and guarantees of their mothership in various cases. So we are \u2013 obviously, there are limited they\u2019re not full guarantees. So we are thoughtful about our exposure and there\u2019s clearly a limit in terms of how much we would have, no different than I think, there\u2019s a limit and how much we would have lot of different types of tenants, particularly ones that are in their more nascent origination as opposed to a company that\u2019s been around for 15 or 20 years. And so we\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it.","Craig Mailman","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you and good morning. Owen, I want to go back to your comments on the capital markets. And I think you said bids are rotating geographically. Can you just talk about that rotation, especially as it relates to China, which has been in the news, maybe pulling back capital? Thanks.","Owen Thomas","So, Jamie, this is a hard thing to exactly quantify. A lot of this is anecdotal and what we see and who\u2019s doing which deals where and what we hear about. But, couple of things: one, as I mentioned, I do think the bid for the kinds of assets that we own remains strong. And I gave bunch of examples of things trading this quarter in the low 4s cap rate. And a lot of them traded to non-U.S. investors. When I talked about rotation, I do think there have been a few adjustments over the last quarter.","Again, this isn\u2019t \u2013 a switch doesn\u2019t flip. These happen slowly over time. We\u2019re seeing, for example, more Korean investors today, I would say, than we saw a year ago. I would say, we\u2019re seeing more Japanese investors in the market today, than we saw, say, versus a year ago. So \u2013 and then some of those investors that we saw a year ago, again this isn\u2019t always the truth \u2013 or always the case, but for example, investors from Canada maybe are slightly less active, or the Middle East. Again, there are examples of transactions to being completed by all these groups.","But that\u2019s just our feel in terms of the tenor of the market. In terms of Chinese investors, look, I am aware as you are of probably specific examples of where capital controls are put in place and specific investors have been taken out of the market. But I do think there are lots of examples where Chinese corporations as well as sovereign funds have made major investments. These are in the U.S. or globally over the last quarter. So I don\u2019t think there is a general wall that\u2019s been built up around China that has cut off outbound capital. And I think, if anything, the Chinese capital has been quite robust over the last quarter.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just very recently, is there a change in that or \u2013 in China, specifically?","Owen Thomas","I can\u2019t tell you that I think there\u2019s been a change in regulation in China that\u2019s cut off capital flows. I could \u2013 I know of \u2013 or I\u2019m aware \u2013 I think we\u2019re aware of some specific examples of investors that have suddenly gone out of the market. But there are definitely other Chinese investors that are actively pursuing transactions, not only in the U.S. but all over the world. And that capital remains flowing.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, Mike, I appreciate your color on how to think about interest expense for next year. And you guys seem like you\u2019re trending ahead of your core guidance. So as we think about 2018 \u2013 and I know you made some comments on the last call, you\u2019re kind of starting in the hole with 399 Park, but any thoughts on how the core outlook looks for next year in terms of same-store and if the better than expected trend from this quarter and the rest of the year is going to help that?","Mike LaBelle","I don\u2019t think anything necessarily changed from last quarter. On the same-store, the challenge we\u2019ve got is that the 399 Park drop is 250 basis points of our same-store, effectively. So we\u2019re going to have growth in the rest of same-store, and the question is how much is it and how far can it overcome that 2.5%. And what I said on the call last quarter was that I thought it was going to be positive. So it was going to be able to overcome the 250 basis points. I don\u2019t want to get more specific than that because there\u2019s a lot of time between now and then, and we\u2019re not going to give guidance until next quarter.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, guys. I think most of my questions have been answered here, but just maybe a quick one on the guidance. Given the beat in the quarter versus your own expectations and excluding the deferred expenses, I guess I\u2019m just wondering with the $0.04 increase based from the straight line being a little bit higher on better leasing activity, curious why it seems like roughly $0.02 upside versus 2Q expectation wouldn\u2019t have maybe flowed through a little bit more, resulting in a little bit more upside. Or was some of that just earlier timing of expected leasing?","Mike LaBelle","I think it mostly was earlier timing. We project that these things are going to happen. We don\u2019t know exactly the date. And when you get a renewal done 45 days in advance of when you expected a quarter ago and you get to start straight-lining that 45 days earlier, it has an impact, but then it\u2019s in our model already for the fourth quarter, right, that, that was going to happen. Same thing with kind of new leases. When you get something done 60 days early, it\u2019s still in the back half of the year of happening, but it\u2019s just happening a little bit sooner. So that\u2019s most of what it is.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks. I don\u2019t know if I missed this from earlier, but did you provide the cap rate for the Carnegie acquisition?","Owen Thomas","We didn\u2019t. So it was a competitive and attractive cap rate.","Doug Linde","I mean, I\u2019m going to speak off the top of my head because I don\u2019t remember. I want to say that the building was like 80-somewhat-percent leased, and it was in the mid-7s.","Vincent Chao","Yes.","Doug Linde","So I think our stabilized number was somewhere close to 8.5% or 9% once we complete the leasing.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Doug, Doug, can we go back to \u2013 on Midtown versus the far West Side. You\u2019ve spoken about the price point and the value space that existing buildings provide versus new construction. But clearly, if tenants are looking for efficiencies or modern space, the new construction is better, and yet the existing buildings are still winning tenants. So are there other things that the existing Midtown buildings offer apart from just value space that keeps tenants going \u2013 coming back versus going for the more efficient floor plates?","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to start with that, and I will add on?","John Powers","Sure. Look, every tenant is different, and every tenant has its own buyer characteristics. We\u2019re dealing with tenants now that have no interest in going to the West Side at all. We have other tenants in our portfolio that went to the West Side. So the Midtown core is still where most tenants want to be. It\u2019s \u2013 many of the tenants that went to the West Side couldn\u2019t find space in the core because of the size of their requirement. So the core of Midtown is very, very stable. And furthermore, the West Side is almost completely leased up now.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, okay, that\u2026","John Powers","So those are not opportunities. When a tenant goes into market, like for example, BlackRock went into market, where are their opportunities? They only had two opportunities in Manhattan. There was no space that size on the East side at all. So they had opportunities to stay in their location. They were split. They wanted to consolidate. They could have gone downtown or they could have the building constructed in the West Side, and that\u2019s what they chose to do.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But John, I appreciate that. And then the second question, just with all the news around MTA in infrastructure and the need there, I know you guys have the MTA site in Midtown. Are there other opportunities where \u2013 for public partner \u2013 public-private partnership where you guys can help sort of with capital needs that the MTA may have and get additional development sites or redevelopment sites?","Owen Thomas","So Alex, a couple of things I want to mention. So on that, there is nothing \u2013 there should be, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything identifiable that we\u2019re actively working on, but there are multiple examples in our overall corporate portfolio where we\u2019re working with transportation authorities on building great buildings. A great example is the Back Bay development where we\u2019re working with MassDOT and don\u2019t forget the origins of the Salesforce Tower where the Transbay authority that is building a major transit hub in San Francisco. So this theme of public-private partnership is very prevalent in our portfolio, and I would assume it would continue.","I think the other thing I just want to touch on, on your question about Midtown versus Hudson Yards and what\u2019s the tenant reaction that we\u2019ve had, certainly, I agree completely with John on a lot of this is the tenant\u2019s preference on where they want to be. I think the other things that I would mention that are important that we hear is transportation infrastructure. When you think about the Grand Central Terminal, all the subway lines, the transportation infrastructure that exists in Midtown is, again, very, very competitive. And also, I think the other thing that\u2019s happening, and obviously, we\u2019re contributing to this, walk around Midtown. Look at the amount of scaffolding and the work that\u2019s going on and the \u2013 and a lot of this work is improving the infrastructure that\u2019s there. And we\u2019re doing it with our own amenities and our own buildings, and I think you\u2019re seeing other landlords all over the district doing this.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Owen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Rob Simone","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. A bunch of mine have already been answered already. But just on Colorado Center real quick. I read a couple months \u2013 about a month ago or so that HBO is giving back about 130,000 square feet. I think it was in 2019. Can you guys comment on that? And I think, Mike, you cited a mid-6% is a stabilized yield. Does that expiration impact that yield at all? And if so, by how much? Thanks a lot.","Doug Linde","So let me comment, and I don\u2019t know if Ray is on, but he can \u2013 I\u2019ll let him add if he\u2019s available.","John Powers","Ray is on.","Doug Linde","Great. HBO has a lease expiration in the beginning of 2019. We are not aware that they have made any conclusive plans to leave. There have been a lot of articles that have been written about their interest in going to a new development that is yet to start. I\u2019m not a soothsayer, but I think it\u2019s going to be awful hard for a new building to be built that hasn\u2019t started yet for them to be in it by that time in 2019. So I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of confidence in everything you read and the timing of everything you read.","Ray Ritchey","I would also add that if HBO does move out, we have tremendous internal demand within Colorado Center that would back fill the HBO space with a substantial uptick in the current space with HBO. So we\u2019re not at all concerned. The HBO space is probably the best space in Colorado Center, and it\u2019s probably 30% to 50% below market. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 if they do depart and then, as Doug said, that\u2019s still in question. In the event, that will be greeted with great glee with the current tenants in the Center.","Rob Simone","Thanks a lot guys, really helpful.","Doug Linde","And just one last comment on that, just \u2013 they are the tenant probably with the least mark-to-market \u2013 the lowest rent and the highest mark-to-market that we have in the Center.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","Erin Aslakson","Hi, good afternoon, guys. So Erin Aslakson here for John. Quick question on Estee Lauder lease. On a net effective basis, I guess, in 2020 this will commence, obviously, rents are actually increasing quite a lot. Would that be a fair assumption? And can you quantify?","Doug Linde","So Erin, I don\u2019t want to be [indiscernible] or snarky about this. I don\u2019t feel like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position to describe what is happening with a specific tenant. The rent will be going up from where it is today, but after that, it will bleed through and you\u2019ll see it in our portfolio statistics and you\u2019ll see it in our same-store, but we\u2019re not going to break out what a specific tenant is paying.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Just one for me, probably for Doug. Appreciate the color on the rent spreads on the 1.3 million square feet of commenced leases during the quarter, but obviously, that\u2019s a little backward looking. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing for the spreads on the leases that were executed in the quarter and whether we should expect any trend, up or down, for spreads in the coming quarters and into 2018.","Doug Linde","I can tell you \u2013 I don\u2019t have a list in front of me as we speak, but the majority of the leasing that\u2019s been done this quarter at the 200 Clarendon Street Building has a dramatic uptick in rents. We were \u2013 we took space back at somewhere between $35 and $45 a square foot, and we\u2019re getting rents between $55 and $80 a square foot. So that piece is dramatic. The \u2013 all the Embarcadero Center leasing is going to be consistent with the leasing that we\u2019ve been doing over the past few quarters where we are generally getting somewhere between a 40% and a 50% gross markup in our leases on a fixed rate basis. And I think I said this before, in the leases that we are doing at 601 and at 399, it\u2019s a pretty flat running-in-place kind of perspective.","So as you look forward, we basically said we need to work really hard, and John and his team are working really hard to put us in a position where we currently are. We\u2019ve got close to 500,000 [indiscernible] we\u2019ve got an average rent there that\u2019s just over $105 a square foot. And that\u2019s where we intend to probably achieve on a lease-to-lease basis when that leasing is done. So we have a modest uptick there, but that\u2019s where the bulk of that $50-plus million is going to come from.","Blaine Heck","Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks. Looks like we\u2019re about a year away from the initial occupancy of Dock72. Can you just provide an update on leasing prospects there?","Doug Linde","John?","John Powers","Well, this deal is up to seven on the West and up to the 12 out of 16 floors on the East. You are right, we\u2019re about one year away from occupancy there. We have no specific deals on, but we\u2019ve covered the market pretty well. We\u2019re bringing a bunch of brokers out there next week. And I think this is a product that will lease once people see it. We have no land costs, so we\u2019re at an advantageous position.","John Kim","Is transportation the major issue at this point as far as getting tenants comfortable with that?","John Powers","Well, there are a lot of issues. It\u2019s in Brooklyn, so that\u2019s a different market. There is a transportation issue. We do have the ferry now, and that\u2019s going to be a big plus.","John Kim","Okay. And then you provided the appraised value at Colorado Center, I was wondering if you had done the same thing with the valuation of the GM Building.","Mike LaBelle","We didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s probably available at $4.8 billion.","John Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks for sticking with us. Doug, regarding your comment on the bridge and the fact that you only have two remaining tenant-disruptive redevelopments planned that haven\u2019t commenced yet, I think Metro Square and 1333 New Hampshire, I\u2019m curious, do we view that as an indication that this huge pace is truly going to decline in terms of redevelopment? And I guess, how important is it to BXP as a publicly traded company with investors, analysts kind of patiently waiting to see this incremental activity decrease over the next three years, thereby allowing the full cash flow potential of the company to come through? Is that important to you? Or is it kind of out of your hand like HBO lease, Colorado Center, then you kind of have to do something? I\u2019m just curious where your mind is about how anxious you are to see that cash flow really start to matriculate to the bottom line.","Doug Linde","Yes. So I think it\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019m sorry, you had to wait this long for it. It\u2019s very important to us. We \u2013 and I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time talking about this when we all get together in October. We have effectively repositioned the portfolio for a long, long time. You don\u2019t do things like what we\u2019re doing at 399 Park Avenue or the plaza of the General Motors Building or the flagship at the Prudential Center or the re-skinning of a suburban office building that was built in the 1980s. You don\u2019t do that every 10 or 15 or 20 years. You do it every 30 or 40 years. And we happen to be in a position where we decided that this was the right time to do all of these things because of the lease expirations.","Buildings like the 120,000 square feet that potentially is expiring at Colorado Center are basic tenant improvements jobs, not repositioning jobs. We are doing the amenitization and the repositioning of that site outside of worrying about the disruption of tenant spaces because it\u2019s not going to impact them. It\u2019s only going to impact the amenity spaces. So we feel really good about where we have positioned the portfolio for a long, long time. We are going to have lease expirations, and some of them will be a little bit lumpy. When I look forward to sort of 2019, as an example, there are a couple of big ones in Washington, DC, but the GSA buildings, there \u2013 these are hardened buildings with unusual tenants in them. We fully expect the tenants to re-lease those buildings. There\u2019s going to be virtually no capital put into them. Things like that are going to happen in the portfolio all the time. But in terms of taking a building out of service and doing something major to it that impacts our ability to lease the space, we basically push through it all.","Rich Anderson","Okay. If you just allow me, it was mentioned \u2013 I think John mentioned West Side is now fully leased, but a lot \u2013 or many have not made the physical move yet. So is there a risk optically that Manhattan office vacancy rates could come down even though you know it may be coming when companies actually make their physical move to the West? Is that something that you have to manage the message a little bit on?","Owen Thomas","Well, let me pick that up. So we look obviously at the leasing statistics very carefully, and we obviously are aware of the supply that\u2019s coming out, and we try to think through the timing for the new supply and what the market will look like at that time. And as you know, we\u2019ve taken various actions in our portfolio, actually, several years ago in anticipation of the current supply that\u2019s coming into the market. So I think that our view is if absorption \u2013 net absorption continues at what it\u2019s been over the last few years that we think that \u2013 of this new construction in New York generally can be absorbed. I mean, you\u2019re going to have tenant movements in new districts, and there may be some pockets of strength and weakness, but in general, we think the market can absorb it.","The issue is will that net absorption continue, and that is more economically driven. I think New York is a vibrant and a competitively successful city and will continue to be that way, but if we have some kind of downturn in the overall economy and the net absorption goes away, that will be more harmful to the market, I think, particularly given this new supply that\u2019s coming on.","Rich Anderson","Right. And I guess it\u2019s just, right now, tenants are in two places, the pre-leased number in the West Side and the existing numbers point East. And that\u2019s my only point. But I guess it\u2019s just that it\u2019s happened at such large scale that\u2019s why I asked the question. And then the last question for me is the Princeton investment, I recognize this is relatively small in all scheme of things, but does that make your total investment there more marketable? And do you ultimately see Princeton as a larger kind of portfolio, a sale candidate down the road? Or are you committed long term to Princeton?","Owen Thomas","So we \u2013 you have to break Princeton into two pieces, first of all. You have Carnegie Center and Tower Center. So you look at \u2013 all our statistics are on a Princeton basis, but those two assets are very different.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Owen Thomas","Tower Center is more challenged. We\u2019ve had more difficulty in leasing it, and I would describe it as non-core. If you look at Carnegie, different story. It\u2019s perennially in the high 80s, low 90s. In terms of occupancy, we have a strong tenant base there, a lot of international pharma companies. We\u2019ve made significant investments at Carnegie, improving our amenities and improving the park overall. And so this \u2013 when this property became available, there\u2019s only three or four assets within the park that we don\u2019t own, and we thought this was a very logical acquisition. It\u2019s small. Doug talked about the cap rate earlier. We thought it was attractive. And of course, we can very efficiently manage it and, of course, spread all our spend on the amenities even further into that building. So we\u2019re committed to Carnegie Center.","Doug Linde","Yes. I would say that the incremental investment was an opportunistic investment. You have a willing seller in Mack Cali who \u2013 this is our only asset in this marketplace. They have one building across the street left. And the \u2013 we just put major money into re-amenitizing our Carnegie Center assets, and we were \u2013 because we didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate, we were not \u2013 we were prohibiting the tenants of other landlords from using the opportunity set and the amenity spaces that we\u2019ve created. And so we had the ability to opportunistically acquire this asset, introduce the amenity program that we have for all the other Carnegie Centers to this building and hopefully be in a position where we can, because we\u2019re doing that, increase the rental rates in the building in a modest to meaningful way over time as well as maintain higher leasing level. And so we looked at it really on a one-off basis and said, look, it will be accretive to our Carnegie investment over time.","Rich Anderson","Good, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Hey, guys. Just one or two follow-ups. It looks like Midtown East rezoning, they get finalized the next week or two. And just curious to get your guys thoughts on what this means for the market. And then can you just talk a little bit more specifically about your 343 Madison development rights there and kind of what place these plans are?","Doug Linde","John?","John Powers","Yes. Well, Midtown East rezoning, it\u2019s been hung up for a while. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a dramatic impact on the market in the short run. There aren\u2019t any a lot of properties that you can tear down and rebuild with an increased FAR. And a lot of Midtown is only built according to the existing code. And we\u2019re moving forward on the MTA site slowly, and hopefully, we\u2019ll have that tapered sometime early next year.","Jed Reagan","What kind of time line should we think about for maybe kicking off that project?","John Powers","It would be quite a ways from now. We\u2019d have to go through Europe, so you\u2019re talking about several years.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thanks. And just \u2013 I think it was mentioned earlier that concessions continue to march higher across your markets. If you are to strip out the rising construction costs, sort of order of magnitude, how much increase in concessions would you say you\u2019ve seen over the last year or so?","Doug Linde","That is an impossible question to answer, Jed. And it\u2019s funny because we\u2019ve talked about it ourselves, which is one of the reasons the concessions are up is because of the costs. So if you\u2019re in San Francisco and Article 24 has been enacted and it\u2019s costing you $35 a square foot more to build out your space, that\u2019s impacting the overall economics of the decision to move and to touch that space. And so it\u2019s impacting the market because it\u2019s just the reality of what you have to deal with. So it\u2019s hard to divorce the two things.","In addition, rents have not gone down, and there is more high-end space on the market in places like Midtown Manhattan. And when someone\u2019s paying $125 a square foot, the tenant improvement allowance is $75 a square foot that was sort of market in 2011, is probably not an appropriate number because the rents were a lot lower in 2011. And so there\u2019s a mismatch of concepts that are going on, so it\u2019s impossible to sort of describe what percentage of those numbers are attributable to the inventory issues in the market. John, I don\u2019t know if you have another thought.","John Powers","No. I think Doug mentioned it earlier. It\u2019s costing more for tenants to move. That\u2019s the key thing. So the TI packages are up, but the price for the tenant is not down. They\u2019re not getting more because of the increase in construction costs.","Jed Reagan","Sure, okay. Appreciate the comments guys.","Owen Thomas","That concludes all of our questions. Thank you for your time and attention. We look forward to seeing everyone at our Investor Conference in early October. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call.

Macro market trends of job growth, urbanization, and office usage remain favorable. Demand in our major markets continues to be strong and we continue to execute successfully on our revenue and earnings growth strategy.","In terms of our key financial highlights for the quarter, we continue to outperform our sector with strong FFO growth in 2019. For the third quarter, our FFO per share was $0.04 above our guidance at the mid-term when adjusting for the refinancing transaction completed in the quarter and was $0.02 above market consensus.","We also raised our full year 2019 FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint net of the refinancing transaction. We are now projecting 11% FFO growth year-over-year in 2019 even after accounting for the refinancing which is one of our strongest FFO growth years in recent history.","Looking ahead to 2020, we are demonstrating the sustainability of our positive growth momentum with initial guidance of 8% FFO per share growth at the midpoint again likely well above the peer average.","In terms of operational highlights, we had a busy and productive third quarter. We completed 2 million feet of leasing which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period bringing our total leasing to 5.9 million square feet year-to-date.","We once again recognized for sustainability performance and leadership by earning an 8th consecutive Green Star recognition from the GRESB assessment and ranking among the top 4% of almost 1000 worldwide participants. We acquired 880 and 890 Winter Street two office buildings in suburban Waltham.","We entered into a joint venture agreement with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for 45% interest in our Platform 16 development in San Jose. And we completed 700 million and 10-year unsecured refinancing on attractive terms.","Now moving to business conditions, our leasing activity remains healthy and evidenced by the well above average leasing volumes we have been reporting throughout 2019. that being said, most of the reported economic data we followed such as U.S. GDP growth, job creation and unemployment indicate healthy but moderating condition.","Economic growth outside the U.S. looks less favorable with China reporting its weakest numbers in three decades and Germany possibly already in recession. While geopolitical issues such as the U.S.-China trade war do not directly impact our business these risks are clearly not constructive for the broader economy.","As a result the U.S. Federal Reserve and most central banks in the developed world have an accommodative posture. The significant drop in yield on long-term rates has held in the U.S. this past quarter and long-term rates actually remain negative and many developed economies such as Japan and Germany.","In terms of impacts on Boston Properties, we do not anticipate a recession near term. The recession risks continue to rise despite slower economic growth, lower interest rates provide a tailwind for financing costs and real estate valuations. We maintain a hedged capital allocation posture in that we continue to invest in new projects driven by tech and life science demand. But at the same time, we are protecting the downside by keeping leverage low pre-leasing most of our developments and keeping our buildings full with credit worthy tenants and increasingly long-term leases. The private real estate capital market for assets in our core markets remains healthy. Those significant office transaction volume in the U.S. ended the third quarter down 18% from last quarter and down 7% from a year ago. We are still seeing reasonably strong investment demand in most of our markets.","The private capital market for office product is becoming more discerning with a preference for tech oriented market locations and minimal lease exposure for assets located in other markets. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. Starting in Boston, 100 Summer Street in the Financial District sold for $806 million, $722 a foot and a 4.2% cap rate. This 1.1 million square foot office property is 87% leased and sold to a real estate advisory firm.","In West LA 5900, Wilshire Boulevard is under agreement to sell for $315 million nearly $700 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate. This 450,000 square foot office building is 86% leased and will be sold to a real estate advisory firm.","In San Francisco, a 50% interest in 525 Market Street in the Financial District is under agreement to sell at a gross valuation of $1.2 billion or nearly $1200 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. This 1 million square foot office building is 97% leased and will be sold to a real estate investment manager. And finally, in Washington DC, 625 High Street in the Northwest Quarter sold for $259, $640 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. This 405,000 square foot building is 65% leased and sold to a real estate advisory firm.","So to summarize, our completed and expected capital activities for 2019, we sold in whole or part five assets for $398 million in gross proceeds versus our goal of $300 million in sales. Several small transactions remained under agreement and could close by year end. We completed three acquisitions so far for $336 million. We launched three new developments comprising a million square feet that are 65% pre-leased with an expected cost of $822 million and projected initial cash yields upon delivery of approximately 7.7%. And we have delivered or expect to deliver into service by year end two projects comprising 675,000 feet costing $508 million at forecast deals.","Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders and our pipeline of current and future developments remains robust. This quarter we commenced our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development property in Washington DC. This office building located near our 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue asset will comprise 480,000 square feet, 61% pre-leased to Wilmer Hale and has an expected total investment of $356 million.","We also commenced our 200 West Street redevelopment in Waltham, Mass. We are converting 126,000 square feet of this suburban office property to life science laboratory space and anticipate investing 48 million into the redevelopment project at double-digit incremental cash yield.","With these additions, our current development pipeline stands at 14 office and residential developments and redevelopment comprising 6.3 million aggregate square feet and $3.6 billion of total investment for our share.","The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7%. Most of the development pipeline is well underway and we have 1.6 billion of equity capital remaining to fund. Given selective asset sales, the scheduled delivery of our current development pipeline and forecast NOI growth from our in-service portfolio, we anticipate being able to fund the current development pipeline without either accessing the public equity markets or exceeding our leverage targets.","As we pursue and add additional new investment opportunities to the pipeline, we will be increasingly accessing private equity partners to extend the use of our equity capital and enhance our returns. To that end, this quarter we entered into a joint venture agreement with CPPIB to sell a 45% interest in our Platform 16 future development project. This anticipated 1.1 million square foot Class A urban office campus in downtown San Jose is adjacent to Google's planned 8 million square foot transit village and the Diridon station transit hub.","With this joint venture we were able to extend the use of our equity capital diversify our risk and enhance our return to shareholders through property level fees and a carried interest arrangement. We are very pleased and honored to enter into this second significant joint venture with CPPIB a leading global institutional investor.","Lastly, this quarter, Boston Properties acquired 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham for $106 million or $270 a square foot. This two building 392,000 square foot office campus which is currently 82% leased is located adjacent to our 1 million square foot Bay Colony property. With this acquisition, we increased our presence in Waltham to around 4 million square feet further increasing our position as the largest owner and manager of Class A office space in this vibrant market.","We plan to invest approximately 20 million of capital to refresh the building and upon lease up and rolling existing rents to market expect to receive in excess of a 7% unleveraged cash return within five years. This is a good example of our acquisition strategy where we use our market presence and knowledge and real estate skills to create value.","Before I conclude as a major office market participant, I wanted to provide Boston Properties perspective on WeWork and Co-Working given the intense media attention on the situation. We believe the shared workspace business which provides flexible term turnkey space at a premium price is an innovation that has aggregated user demand has been a positive for the office market and will remain an important procurement option for certain occupier requirements.","To put all this in perspective, shared workspace represents only 1.6% of office space in the U.S. and as high as 3.6% in New York and San Francisco. Its share of gross leasing activity and net absorption has been materially higher. Though we believe the shared workspace market has growth potential, we anticipate a pause given recent capital raising challenges in the industry. WeWork has built an important market position in the industry and has the potential for further growth assuming it executes well with the proceeds from its recent recapitalization.","Regarding the potential impact Boston Properties, the revenue we received from WeWork from five leases in Boston Properties whole and partially owned assets is about 1% of our total revenue. And all WeWork facilities in our portfolio that have been open for more than a year are substantially full.","And lastly, we also have relationships with other shared workspace operators and our own offering called FLEX by BXP.","So, to summarize BXPs performance in the third quarter, a year ago we told you, we were at the inflection point of strong and sustainable growth. We've delivered on that commitment and are on track to exceed the growth targets we outlined for 2019 a year ago. We're also delighted with our forecast trajectory for 2020 with estimated FFO per share growth of 8% at the midpoint.","Once again we are delivering that growth through a balance of solid same property growth pre-lease development coming into service and smart allocation of capital and expense control. We continue to outperform our sector along most key metrics greatest scale, strongest credit rating, strongest FFO per share growth, greater geographic diversity across both West Coast and East Coast markets, a newer and higher quality portfolio of assets that we've either recently developed or modernized and an unwavering focus on customer satisfaction making BXP the developer and landlord of choice.","Let me turn the call over to Doug for more details.","Doug Linde","Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody.","So, this is the time of the year that we introduced our perspective annual guidance which you all saw in our press release last night. My market commentary this morning is going to focus on the opportunities in our portfolio as they relate to that guidance. Mike's going to provide you with a range for our same-store growth in 2020 and you should think about my remarks as the backdrop for the upper and lower edges of that band. We have completed a significant amount of forward leasing over the past few years which has had the effect of creating an extremely durable revenue stream and provided good clarity on the range of expected outcome going forward especially for 2020.","So, I'll start in the Bay Area. San Francisco has a vacancy rate in the low single digits and an availability rate in the mid single digits, 2019 leasing activity has slowed simply to the lack of available space. It's anyone's guess when the first and mission projects, the only speculative building under construction will actually deliver. But it's surely not before 2023.","CBRE put out a report a few days ago that indicated that large available blocks over 30,000 square feet even if they're at the base of buildings have asking rents on average over $100 gross. In October, the Prop M received its annual allocation 875,000 square feet bringing the total available availability of Prop M to about 900,000 square feet. We're scheduled to go before the Planning Commission in December to receive our LPA and a Prop M allocation for 505,000 square feet a partial allocation for 4th and Harrison.","Our current plan allows for a phased development of the 505,000 square foot building and a 255,000 square foot building. We believe we could start the project as early as the fourth quarter of 2020 and deliver occupied space at the end of 2022. So still a pretty long way out.","Our San Francisco CBD portfolio ended the quarter at 96.8% occupied and 98.7% committed. To-date in 2019, we've completed 490,000 square feet of space leasing with an average gross rent increase of about 34%. In 2020, we have 5 full floor expirations in our entire 5.6 million square foot CBD portfolio. We have a lease out on one floor. We are taking one floor for our own office growth and we are dedicating one floor to small enterprise users. This leaves a single build out floor at 535 Mission where the asking rent is over $80 triple net compared to an expiring end of about $60 triple net. And a single floor at easy 3. We have one multi-floor expiration prior to the end of 2021 in the entire portfolio in the CBD. And that tenant has requested our renewal proposal. Last year at this time, we had seven available full floors.","In the Silicon Valley, we have a large portfolio of development opportunities. This market continues to experience strong growth led by Google, who recently purchased the former Yahoo campus from Verizon almost 1 million square feet. Verizon in turn has leased 650,000 square feet in close proximity to the Caltrans station in Santa Clara. Uber this quarter has taken another 300,000 square feet in Sunnyvale in close proximity to a Caltrans and we are aware of other San Francisco headquartered companies that are looking in the valley for large blocks of space as well as valley companies that continue to grow.","At Platform 16 in San Jose, we are enabling the site and making presentations to tenants that are looking for large blocks of space. It's next to Caltrans. In our existing Mountain View portfolio, we continue to release or renew space that rents in excess of 55 triple net that's single storey product. In 2020, our most significant opportunity in the Bay Area is in this Mountain View portfolio where we will soon have 150,000 square feet of availability.","Turning to the East Coast. These are our views on Manhattan now the market conditions have changed. Demand in Manhattan remains robust. Uber announced their deal, Google completed their transaction and at this moment there are technology tenants in active discussions on 300,000 square feet to 1.5 million square feet requirements that represents significant growth. There are a dozen other tenants law firm, banks, media companies, insurance companies and more technology companies with requirements in excess of 300,000 that are seriously considering a relocation to either new construction or renovated project. There will still be significant existing supply from known relocations much of it in older assets that will need substantial capital. So while we are optimistic about the shrinking availability of newly constructed space, we continue to have a cautious view on transaction economics over the next few years. This quarter, we completed a 20-year renewal at 599 Lex with our Anchor law firm starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338,000 square feet.","Let's pause here for a minute. We have now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140,000 feet that was due to expire through 2024. We started that back in 2014. And we relet the City space at 399 Park Avenue and 601 Lex in its entirety. As a note, the transaction costs disclosed in our supplemental are elevated this quarter due to the 340,000 square foot early renewal we completed in 2014 with [indiscernible] at the General Motors building that commenced this quarter. Excluding that lease transaction costs would drop the $43 in total or $5.33 a year. There was no free rent in that transaction but in lieu we provided a higher TI concession.","Our portfolio focused in New York remains the four floors 97,000 square foot block at 399 Park Avenue in the General Motors building. We are in lease negotiations today for three of the four floors at 399 Park Avenue and are in discussions with an existing tenant that is interested in expanding into the final floor.","We expect this currently vacant space will provide revenue during the fourth quarter of 2020. At the General Motors building since the completion of the plaza work and the opening of the Apple Cube last month, we have commenced lease negotiations for a full floor vacancy at the top, reached agreement to extend two additional four floors that are expiring in 2020 and have activity on a number of the smaller spaces in the building.","Activity is meaningfully up though revenue on shelf spaces won't commence until the end of 2020. We still have some work to do with three full floors that will be available during the second quarter of 2020. But we have great progress.","I also want to note that at 159 East 53rd Street, we will begin collecting cash rent in two days on the entire 195,000 square feet. However, our incoming tenant has yet to begin their improvement construction which means this will push out our GAAP recognition of revenue into late 2020.","Dock 72 opened in September for WeWork and we expect to open the amended space later this quarter. Along with the [Rudin] [ph] organization, we are doing everything we can to market the project to the real estate and tenant community. Two weeks ago, we hosted a two day CRE tech conference and had over 1700 real estate tech participants experience the project. Wegmans opened last week adding another amended to the Navy Yard. We continue to have tenant discussions but there is no imminent lease signing in our sites and hence no expectation for additional revenue contribution in 2020.","Moving on to DC, Northern Virginia where almost 10% of the company NOI originates has the largest opportunity for improved occupancy in 2020. The tech tenants that have identified the DC Metro employment base as a fertile area for workforce expansion are continuing to grow and that growth is going to be in Northern Virginia.","In addition, the contractors that serviced the defense and Homeland Security businesses are also expanding. Last week, the Pentagon awarded the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract a pretty big deal. We expect this initiative will create significant office demand in Northern Virginia. There is still vacancy in Northern Virginia. But the Urban Core of Reston continues to outperform the market with a vacancy rate under 9% and starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s. This quarter we completed a 15-year renewal with the GSA for 492,000 square feet and our Dominion project in 90,000 square feet of renewals in the Reston Urban Core. And two weeks ago, we executed the 75,000 square foot lease with Facebook on three available floors and the Reston Urban Core.","We are in active lease negotiations with two large tenants totaling 450,000 square feet. We still will have 500,000 square feet of known availability in 2020, but there are a number of active requirements a few in excess of 100,000 square feet and we expect to make some of these deals, Ray probably expects to make all of them. As we sit here in late 2019, this space is expected to be vacant during portions of 2020.","Finally, let's touch on the Boston market where current conditions are as good as we have seen them in our company's history. While similar to San Francisco to the extent there is very little available space in large blocks in the Boston CBD, there are some buildings under construction which will deliver in late 2022 and 2023 with current availability. And there are active plans for new construction which will create supply in 2023 and beyond. Currently, however, there are more than 20 active requirements in the market between 50,000 and 250,000 square feet.","Our CBD portfolio is 99% occupied today and we continue to complete forward leasing transactions. During the quarter, we completed almost 200,000 square feet of early renewals and expansions with an average increase in rents of about 30% in the CBD. Much of that expansion is leased to other tenants so we won't realize that revenue until the existing leases expire. In 2020, we have one full floor expiring in the entire Boston CBD portfolio and we have a lease out on that space for delivery upon expiration of the existing lease.","We leased an additional 112,000 square feet at our 100 Causeway Street Tower bringing that building under development to 87% leased. In Cambridge, we have no availability but our new development 145 Broadway, 485,000 square feet building leased entirely to Akamai is opening this week on Friday. There continues to be significant demand in the Waltham Lexington submarket which is where we have our greatest availability in the region approximately 5000,000 square feet including 75,000 square feet at the recently acquired 880, 890 assets.","Owen described our plans for 200 West Street. So, we have expanded our potential tenant universe in Waltham to now include lab requirements, 195 West Street is an adjacent 63,000 square foot building that became vacant during the third quarter. It may also be converted to life sciences, but we're holding off until we have better leasing visibility at 200 West Street. The 880, 809 buildings were added to the Waltham inventory at the end of August. Our ownership along with the knowledge that we intend to invest in the buildings as we have at Bay Colony has already paid off with signed leases or active negotiations on half of the vacant space at rents in the low to mid 40s. New construction offers rent in this market are in the mid 50s for office and lab rents are pushing $60 triple net.","To conclude tenant demand for high quality workspace remains strong and the fight for talent continues to be a primary focus for our customers. We are seeing very strong mark-to-markets in San Francisco and the Boston CBD assets and have opportunities for incremental occupancy related revenue pickup in our Mountain View and Waltham suburban submarkets.","Our activity at 399 Park Avenue should deliver some late 2020 revenue improvements and we are having good success with our high-end product at the General Motors building. Finally in Reston, we have good lease negotiations on some near-term expirations and we still need to bring in some new requirements to absorb the 2020 vacancy, but Jake Stroman and Ray Ritchie in the team in Washington is going to deliver that.","Michael now translate this operating activity into our 2020 earnings guidance.","Mike LaBelle","Great. Thanks Doug. Hello everybody.","So last night we released our 2019 and 2020 FFO guidance. We expect 2019 FFO growth of 11% and our initial guidance for 2020 FFO growth is 8% at the midpoint of our range. Our growth is being driven by a combination of strong fundamental operating performance in our portfolio and delivering accretive new developments.","Before I jump into the details, I want to touch on our recent financing activities because we were quite busy this quarter. First, we closed a $400 million construction loan to fund the remaining costs to complete our 100 Causeway Office Tower at the Hub on Causeway development in Boston. The financing is attractively priced at LIBOR plus a 150 basis points pointing to the strength of the project that is now 87% pre-leased and will start to be delivered in the second quarter of 2021.","Second we issued $700 million of new 10-year unsecured bonds at a 2.9% coupon. We use the proceeds to early redeem a $700 million existing bond that had a 5.6%, which was due to expire in November of 2020. As a result of this, we incurred a charge on debt extinguishment of $28 million which is the redemption premium to prepay the old bonds. The charge totaling $0.16 per share is reflected in our FFO results for the third quarter and our guidance for the full year 2019.","Although we don't expect interest rates to increase in the near-term credit spreads are potentially more volatile and are also near all time lows. We view this as an opportunistic trade and it significantly reduced our borrowing costs on $700 million by 270 basis points. The impact on our interest expense going forward is a reduction of approximately $18 million per year or $0.11 per share.","Turning to our earnings results, we had a strong third quarter with our revenues up 8% and our FFO up 10% over last year after adjusting for the debt extinguishment charge. We had strong same property performance as well with our share of same property NOI up 7.1% and our share of same property NOI on a cash basis up 5.2% over last year.","As we've described on prior calls, our same property NOI growth is moderating in the back half of 2019 as we track against higher comps. We expect our cash same property performance will be flat to slightly negative in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is due to the recently executed 20-year lease extension with a large tenant in New York City that included free rent at the end of 2019.","We expect our cash same property performance to turn back to positive in the first quarter of 2020 and for all of 2020. For the third quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.64 per share that was $0.04 per share or approximately $7 million higher than the midpoint of our updated guidance. The increases from $0.02 per share up higher than projected portfolio NOI and $0.02 per share better than projected management and service fee income. The outperformance in the portfolio came primarily from earlier than projected leasing at higher rents and lower operating expenses that we expect will hit in the fourth quarter.","For fee income we earned leasing commissions on the new leasing this quarter at our Hub on Causeway developments and higher service fee income. For the full year 2019, we're updating our FFO guidance range to $6.98 to $7 per share. This equates to an increase of $0.10 per share at the midpoint versus our recent guidance. The increases from growth in our same property in NOI that exceeded our assumptions by 25 basis points adding $0.02 per share; improvement and the contribution of our non-same properties including the acquisition of 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham of $0.02 per share; higher fee income of $0.02 per share. We also project lower net interest expense of $0.04 per share primarily from the benefit of our lower borrowing rates.","We provided detailed initial guidance for 2020 FFO last night in our supplemental report that's on our Web site. As we look ahead to 2020, we expect to continue our strong FFO growth trend. Our growth will be driven by higher NOI from our same property portfolio for both occupancy gains and higher rents as well as the delivery of new developments. In the in-service portfolio, we anticipate ending this year at an occupancy rate of 92.5%.","For 2020, we expect to increase occupancy 100 basis points ending the year around 93.5%. In the Boston market, our urban portfolio in Boston and Cambridge is highly occupied so our focus is on early renewals where we expect a role in place rents up to significantly higher market rents. In the suburban Boston portfolio, we lost 170,000 square feet of occupancy from expiring leases this quarter. As Doug described the activity in Waltham is robust and we anticipate gaining occupancy back in 2020.","In New York City, we have approximately 570,000 square feet of vacant space at the GM Building 399 Park Avenue in Times Square Tower, 360,000 square feet of this or more than 60% has signed leases that will commence by mid-2020. We have good leasing activity on the remaining space and expect that a portion will be leased with revenue recognition by the end of 2020. Overall, we expect occupancy to be higher next year in the New York City portfolio.","In Los Angeles, we're currently 97% leased with below market rents. We have the opportunity to increase our revenue through completing renewals at higher rents on most of the approximately 750,000 square feet of leases that expire at the end of 2020 through 2021. As Doug detailed, we're also highly occupied in San Francisco though we continue to have the opportunity to gain revenue on our rollover that has a strong positive mark-to-market in both the City and in Mountain View.","Next year's earnings will also benefit from the full year of stabilized income at Salesforce Tower that reached 99% occupancy this quarter. Doug also described in detail the rollover exposure that we have in Reston where we will have temporary downtime impacting both our occupancy and our revenues in 2020. In the district, the majority of our rollover exposure is behind us having occurred in 2019 and our 2020 exposure is limited.","Our guidance assumes strong growth in same property NOI and cash same property NOI of 3% to 4.75% in 2020 led by revenue growth in Boston and San Francisco. We are assuming non-cash rents to be $100 million to $130 million with the vast majority being free rent that will convert to cash rent. Fair value rent now contribute only $9 million of non-cash rent that's a decrease from approximately $10 million from 2019. So our 2020 same property NOI growth would have been 50 basis points higher, if you exclude the negative impact of the burn-off of this non-cash fair value rent.","We will also see growth in 2020 from the delivery of several key development properties and the acquisition this quarter of 880, 890 Winter Street. Our assumption of incremental growth in NOI from development and acquisitions is $60 million to $70 million in 2020. The most significant of these is our 475,000 square foot 145 Broadway development in Cambridge and other key development deliveries contributing to our growth includes 1750 President Street in Reston, 20 City Point in Waltham and the Podium Office and retail phases as well as the 440 unit residential phase of the Hon Causeway in Boston.","Our 2019 and early 2020 deliveries totaled 2.3 million square feet and $1.1 billion of new investment. We expect termination income in 2020 to decline by approximately $10 million or $0.06 per share from 2019. This primarily relates to several lease terminations in 2019 instigated by us to accommodate new or relocating clients that we assume will not recur. We also expect our management and services fee income to decline in 2020.","We're completing several large fee development projects. These include Dock 72, the first two phases of the Hub on Causeway and the development of the TSA Headquarters project in Springfield, Virginia that we are managing for a third-party. Our assumption for 2020 fee income is $25 million to $32 million and represents a decline of $10 million or $0.06 per share at the midpoint from 2019.","Our assumption for net interest expenses in 2020 is $410 million to $430 million. In addition, we expect $9 million of incremental interest expense associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures that is contained in the income from joint ventures line of our income statement.","In aggregate, this equates to a modest $3 million increase in interest expense for 2020 at the midpoint. The interest expense savings we've created by reducing our borrowing costs with our recent debt refinancing is offset by incremental interest expense from our $850 million June 2019 notes offering, higher expected line of credit usage from funding development costs and the cessation of capitalized interest from delivering developments.","So to summarize, we are initiating our 2020 FFO guidance with a range of $7.45 to $7.65 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.56 per share over the midpoint of our 2019 guidance. The increase is comprised of $0.38 per share of NOI growth in our same property portfolio and $0.37 per share from development deliveries and acquisitions. That is partially offset by a $0.12 per share decline in termination and management service fee income, $0.02 per share of higher net interest expense, a $0.03 per share increase in G&A expense and $0.02 per share of lost income from asset sales.","So in 2019, we're anticipating a sector leading 11% FFO growth and we're following it up with guidance for 8% FFO growth in 2020 using the midpoint of our range another strong growth year. We continue to demonstrate terrific growth both internally through increased pricing and occupancy in our same property portfolio and externally by delivering substantial new development investments that are primarily pre-leased and generating very attractive investment returns.","And looking further ahead, we have another $2.4 billion of development scheduled to come online between late 2020 and 2022. The commercial space in these projects is 83% pre-leased to a roster of high quality companies. They include the new Marriott headquarters in Bethesda, a new building in Cambridge leased to Google, 100 Causeway in Boston leased to Verizon, 159 East 53rd Street in New York City leased to NYU, Reston Gateway leased to Fannie Mae and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue anchored by Wilmer Hale. These developments and others that we are working to add to the pipeline will contribute meaningfully to our continuing growth over the next several years.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I guess first off, Mike, in terms of the guidance for next year, can you quantify what is the negative impact to same-store NOI growth next year from GM Reston any other kind of known move outs? And then, what are some of the other major move ins that are benefiting next year?","Mike LaBelle","So, we talked on our last call about the rest and move outs, which I think was $17 million approximately and GM was about the same. We were recovering a little bit of the GM because we've actually been successful in renewing a couple of tenants. So, as Doug pointed out so eloquently we've had good activity in GM and we've done better there than we expected. Other than that, we're seeing strong activity in Boston, we have a lot of early renewals that we're doing at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Center; at 100 Fed, we'll get a full year of the renewal that we did with the Bank of America; and Cambridge continues to be an opportunity although there's no vacancy. The little bit of rollover we have is going to have a big roll up and we'll continue to work on some early renewal activity.","Embarcadero Center is significant. We've been building that for a couple of years. We had a big four floor tenant expiring in the middle of 2020, all of that lease, all of that space is basically leased. And we'll commence with big roll ups when it comes available to us. And in New York City, we're also growing year-over-year. So, our NOI from that portfolio will grow and the GM building is growing all of the retail we expect to be leased and generating revenue in 2020 and as Doug described we've had some success in the office network.","Doug Linde","I just sort of say the following which is that so the low end of our range assumes everything that we've got going that and all the things we've already done in the high-end of our range assumes that we have a little bit more success with some of the opportunities in front of us in the portfolio vacancy that I described.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful thanks. And then, just second question is on Platform 16. Can you give us a feel for when that project may start and how should we think about the cost expected yield. And I'm assuming you're not going to go spec, but there's not that much spec construction in that market right now feel that there's a lot of demand. And we heard from brokers in the market, you're targeting something like $65, $70 dollar net rent. So, I mean how should we just think about the opportunity here and when it's going to begin? Thanks.","Owen Thomas","So, it's Owen. Just to talk a little bit about the marketplace, I think you're right, we are ahead of the other projects that are seeking entitlement and finalizing development plans. Google just made some progress on their entitlement for the project that they're building next to the Diridon Station which is a positive. Much of the development that goes on in this area is not pre-leased. We are actively speaking with potential customers now and hope to acquire an anchor tenant for this project. We are incrementally investing in it today. We are clearing the site, preparing drawings, I would anticipate that this project would commence next year and we will leg into it based on the physical requirements of the site and market conditions.","The forecast yields for the project based on our expected costs and the expected rents are in excess of 7%.","Doug Linde","This is Doug. You should think about this is a phase project right. So, there are three buildings to be built here. This is just under 500,000 square feet. And so, if we were to do something, we do something with one of the buildings not all three of the buildings at the same time.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey. Good morning everyone. You talked about bringing in additional private equity sources especially in your JV developments. Can you just share with us your thoughts on developing within the JV is rather than selling stabilized assets especially in one -- in more stabilized rather than growth markets, instead of giving up maybe some of the development upside.","Owen Thomas","So, Manny, its Owen. It's a balance, as I mentioned, we are bringing in joint venture partners because of the robust pipeline of opportunities that we have in front of us. We are not intending to issue equity at our current share price. And we certainly don't want to exceed our leverage target. So that's the governor. We look perspectively what our leverage levels are, and the capital needs from our development pipeline, then we make a decision as to whether we want to, or need to bring in a JV partner on a specific deal.","I would say also in the case of Platform 16, it's also a REIT mitigation decision as well because it's a site and it's not pre-leased. And there are -- definitely rewards from the investment, but there are also risks and so we are diversifying our risks as well.","In terms of asset sales, we continue to sell assets, I described nearly 400 million of sales that we conducted this year that is material. We will keep doing that. But, as I described before selling major assets for us is inefficient way of raising capital for the developments because most of our major assets have a significant embedded gain. And with the sale comes a requirement to make a special dividend, so we can't retain that capital to invest in that development and it brings down our forecast FFO growth.","So that's how we think it. Mike or Doug, anything you guys want to add?","Emmanuel Korchman","Doug, you had talked about the wildcard show lease that sort of [throws off stats] [ph]. Is there anyway that you guys could or have mapped for us sort of any of those big chunky leases that have happened in the past or starting to roll into numbers now that are either impacting earnings or other stats?","Doug Linde","We can certainly try and think of a way to provide -- give some information. I think that, our hesitation is that unappropriate for us to describe the economics of a particular tenant and because they're so lumpy in terms of when they occur giving you explicit information would be -- would I think not be appropriate. I mean, I can tell you that there was a significant roll up in the gross rent with that tenant and we provided them with TI allowance. That was -- that includes the value of free rent in the form of capital, which skewed the capital numbers, but they didn't get any free rent.","So those are the kinds of things that are happening in these transactions, which by the way make it a little bit more challenging to describe the \"capital intensity\" of leases across an office portfolio because so much of this stuff is a part of a negotiation. And it is true that we are in capital intensive businesses from a transaction cost perspective. But we -- sometimes we trade free rent and increase revenue in the short-term for additional capital.","So I'm not sure we can think about it and come back to you and if you ask specific questions, we're more than happy to try and give you as much clarity as we can.","Emmanuel Korchman","Great. And I don't want Mike to feel left out, so I've got one for him too. You talked about the same store declined in 4Q '19. Can you quantify how much of a lift that then provides in 2020, if you were just to isolate that event?","Mike LaBelle","Well, I think what I can tell you is that I think the first quarter of 2020 should be a strong quarter of same store growth. And then, in the second and third quarter of 2020, we're going to experience a rollout in Reston. So, the second and third quarter we'll be dampened because of those rollouts and then -- towards the end of the year it should increase again. I think that's the best way to respond to your question.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up Mike on that fourth quarter swing into negative territory. You mentioned that was partially driven by free rent on a major lease in New York. When does that free rent period burn off next year?","Mike LaBelle","It will be burned off before next year. December of 2019 was the free rent period.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. Doug, a couple of questions on New York, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned strong demand for new build product. How would you characterize the leasing market for older assets like the GM building? And also you mentioned that you're cautious on transaction economics in New York. And I was wondering if that was commentary on cap rates.","Doug Linde","So, I'll answer the first two questions and I'll let Owen answer the third question. So, the leasing activity in New York City on buildings that have recapitalized or repositioned themselves is very strong. And there is significant amounts of demand for buildings both on Sixth Avenue or on Park Avenue or in the Plaza District that are not \"new construction\" that have taken the thought and energy of how to recapitalize and reposition those assets. And for us that's both 399 Park Avenue, 601 Lexington Avenue, and the General Motors Building. With specifically with regards to the GM building, I think I was pretty explicit that we've got a lot of activity going on. That's six months ago did not exist. So the activity in that building, which while you may describe it as an older building in terms of when it was built has had a dramatic amount of new capital put into it.","And so, and if you go there, it's a pretty spectacular entry experience now after a really tough sell for the last two or three years because of the construction. And we have a full floor lease out on the top of the building and we have two tenants that are going to renew -- two other floors that are renewing in 2020. And we have other good activity in the building. So, we feel on a relative basis a lot better today than we did six months ago.","Owen Thomas","And then to answer your question on the capital market for New York, I think it's bifurcated. I think the market has softened up a little bit in New York for specific classes of assets. So, let me explain. So, we just sold 540 Madison in Midtown last quarter and had great execution on that in terms of cap rate. That as I mentioned last quarter was a smaller asset. It was just over $300 million. So I think for what I'd call bite size single assets in New York, I think there's still a very strong market as we demonstrated last quarter.","I think the market is also a very robust for buildings that are in tech-oriented areas of New York and for newer buildings. And I think the market has softened up a bit for more commodity like buildings and certainly buildings -- including buildings that have some significant near term rollover.","John Kim","And last question, if I may. On South San Francisco, it's a very tight market. There's increased spillover over of tech tenants moving into that submarket. Is there anything that you can do with 601 and 611 gateway to capture some of this demand?","Owen Thomas","The answer is yes. We think there are things that we can do. We are thinking real hard about how in fact those buildings might be repositioned, so that they can accommodate some of that non-traditional office based a.k.a. lab use. And, I think we'll have -- we're in the process of thinking about that and we'll have more to discuss in coming quarters.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys. Doug, you mentioned that things are getting a lot better at GM and I appreciate your previous commentary. Is there anything you can isolate that was an inflection that all of a sudden there are more showings or you get [indiscernible] renew that you thought maybe at flight risk? Anything specifically?","Doug Linde","So, John Power, why don't you try to answer that question because you're closer to it than I am.","John Powers","Well, certainly opening the fabulous new Apple stores, the number one, as Doug mentioned, we've been three plus years without a front door, and having our tenants and the showings go around to the Lexington app side or to the Apple store or all kinds of configurations. So, I would say that is one huge difference. And if you haven't been there, you should go because it's pretty spectacular.","Secondly, I think some of this is just timing in the market where tenants are now active and looking and we have space that matches up with needs in the marketplace. We had a number of showings before, but there was somewhat of mismatch between the sizes people were looking for and what we had available.","Craig Mailman","That's helpful. Then, Owen, going back to your earlier comments on WeWork and the Co-Working space. I know you guys now have the FLEX offering, but I'm just curious, the one thing that seems like we were proved out was that enterprise tenants were willing to pay up for flexibility. So, I'm just curious what you guys see may over the next, one to three years of maybe changing mindset from landlords and how kind of office space could be or should be leased to potentially capture the premium recipe with the pay for flexibility?","Owen Thomas","Yes. That' a good question. Look, I think that what we are seeing in the market is that major corporate users continue to want to have their own headquarters and controlled spaces that are unique and it provides them ability to express their brand and compete for talent. And these facilities are going to be secured on a very long-term basis because that's how they want them.","And if you look at our development pipeline, we're building a number of these corporate, -- either a corporate headquarters or regional headquarters for these companies. That all being said, the needs of a company for its square footage, the personnel needs of a company often are more volatile than the timeframe required to procure space on a long-term basis. So, we do think that there are many companies out there that large users that if they could procure some of their space on the margin. And again, it's hard to say exactly what that percentage is, is it 5% is it 10%, who knows? But there's clearly a value to those corporate customers to be able to procure some space on the margin, on a flexible basis.","And we work the other operators and now ourselves with FLEX by BXP are tapping into that. I think one thing that is being figured out in the marketplace today is how should that space be priced? Because you are leasing it on a short-term basis and how as the owner of the building, should you be rewarded for that? And what should the rental premium be? Obviously, on a short-term basis, you're taking more vacancy risk. And if you own the space, like we do with FLEX, our TI costs are higher. So that's how the market is evolving.","And I would just talk to the following, which is for the most part and I've used this word, in previous conversations about this topic this is shock absorber space. Meaning typically companies are trying to do something either internally with their particular \"platform,\" a.k.a. I'll give you an example. We have a tenant that's agreed to take a piece of the space that we're building in Boston for nine months because they're going to do a major renovation of their own place and they need some place to send their people while the space is being renovated because they don't have swing space in the building.","So that's -- I consider that shock absorber space or tenants that are growing in a significant way and the building that they may have -- under construction for themselves may not be done yet, but they still need to hire people or they are thinking about a new business opportunity and they're not sure if it's going to be permanent or not. I mean there are lots of those types of situations that we have seen across the portfolio where we see these types of tenants trying to take that kind of space. And then, \"FLEX\" by BXP space is primarily driven towards small enterprise users. So we're building out floors, not hundreds of floors but a floor or two here and there. And we are looking to try and subdivide it into what we think are appropriate segments of space, meaning 3000, 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 square feet and putting it in a particular place in the building in a type of configuration where it can be easily change for the particular needs of a tenant without much in the way of additional costs. And for that we are charging a significant premium.","Bryan Koop","This is Bryan Koop. What we're finding evidenced out as Doug said, is that it's a perfect compliment for our existing client base and especially on these larger projects like the Prudential Center of the hub. We're finding that predominantly the FLEX user is our existing customers for their short-term needs. And it continues to be something that they have strong interest in and we're having daily dialogue with our primary customers on. So it's not as much they'll call it the freelance market. Although we do have those customers in FLEX, it's been predominantly our existing enterprise users.","Craig Mailman","That's helpful. And one quick one for Mike, do you have anything in guidance related to maybe going forward the 2021 unsecured given kind of the cost account, just got the 700 million?","Mike LaBelle","We don't -- so in 2021 mid year, we have, I think its $800 million at 4.5% roughly that is coming due. I mean, we're obviously looking and thinking about it, but there's nothing in guidance for pulling those forward and paying them up early.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I was hoping Ray or team can talk more about the comments on the JEDI project and what you think that might mean for office demand in Northern Virginia. And actually office end data center and maybe if you could talk about land availability and given how that's been gobbled up by the data center sector?","Ray Ritchey","Hey Jamie, it's Ray. Obviously, JEDI is a great news for the entire DC region, most specifically toward Virginia. The vast majority of cloud talent is in the Dulles corridor. And with the exposure of both data centers and the headquarters for major cyber focus government agencies invest in Herndon's, all the three letter agencies and 80% of the internet traffic going through Loudon County. Clearly JEDI will be focusing on Northern Virginia. And as the dominant landlord in that corridor, we expect to get a lot of demand and owning the best office product. We expect to be the recipient of a lot of that demand. But, we're not in a position to make any comments on specific deals or requests for space at this point in time.","I can just say the general demand from the tech community in the Dulles corridor and specifically Reston town center has never been stronger. And we talk about the vacancy in Reston. It's important to note that the large sector that vacancy is a relocation of Leidos out of one building, doubling in size to the new building in 1750. So, the biggest issue there is not bad news is great news that we're meeting the demand of our existing tenants. But, I guess the JEDI to DC is almost important as the match natural wind tonight. So, we'll be equally hopeful in both.","Jamie Feldman","Is there any thought on how long it takes to actually translate into real demand?","Ray Ritchey","I think the demand is going to be almost immediate.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, switching gears to Silicon Valley, I mean, we saw the Stripe announcement, they're moving from CBD San Francisco to South San Francisco. Can you just talk generally about some of the headquarters or not even headquarters, but some of the moves either from the city down the peninsula or to Silicon Valley. And just kind of how people should be thinking about or how you're thinking about the submarkets that are going to matter most and the types of product that are going to matter most, will we see a shift?","Doug Linde","So, this is Doug. So, couple of things. First of all, there is no available big block space in San Francisco. So anybody who is looking to grow significantly in the city is going to have a really hard time between now and 2020 something when a new building gets built and you saw Pinterest and Salesforce commit to -- at the time on unentitled sites and one of them is still unentitled. The workforce is also important. And so, to the extent that it becomes more and more challenging to move around the Silicon Valley. Some of the large Silicon Valley headquartered CBD -- headquartered CBD companies are looking at the Silicon Valley as a fertile place for them to put a location so that it can absorb some additional talent that is not necessarily in the city. And so I assume that is why Uber, for example, went down there and there are two or three others that we're aware of they're looking for additional space right now in the Silicon Valley. Being close to public transit is critical. And so the closer you get to the Caltran and more importantly to the bullets stops on the Caltran, the better off you are going to be.","With regards to South San Francisco the move from Stripe, there are a number of companies that are in the payments business Square moved to Oakland. Visa has -- I think made it clear that they're not going to grow in the city of San Francisco. There's a gross receipts tax that is not hospitable to companies that are in the payment transaction business. And so my assumption is that those types of companies will be less likely to grow in the city and more likely to grow outside of the city.","But again, the fact of the matter is, is that there are so few opportunities in the district -- in the city itself to make a large splash and grow. It's naturally causing tenants to look elsewhere. And they are most importantly looking for places that are in close proximity to public transportation.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thanks. And then last, are there any developments starts or funding development starts included in the '20 guidance?","Mike LaBelle","Nothing new, I mean, again, we're continuing to do some work to prepare Platform 16 to start, but we're not including the cost of starting that development nor is 4th and Harrison assumed in there. And anything that we start those costs obviously will be capitalized. So, the interest cost associated with funding those costs, which would come off of our line of credit or otherwise would be capitalized.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wonder, Doug, could you maybe just talk about the sort of divergence we're seeing kind of in financial services, the announcements of JPMorgan recently potentially moving kind of jobs out versus kind of big tech coming into the city and how you sort of think that dynamic kind of plays out over the next couple of years and its impact on overall net absorption.","Doug Linde","So, I'll make a general comment and I'll let Owen describe what's going on in the city from the phase respective. So in general, Steve there has not been a lot of what you would refer to as job growth in the financial services sector for quite some time. There has been job growth in the financial services technology business. So, the Marcus that the new bank's that Goldman Sachs is operating is being created. Presumably there are a lot of tech jobs because it's an online bank. I mean we've seen JPMorgan and others taking what we would refer to as tech kind of space for their technology oriented businesses. But by and large, there has not been a lot of \"growth\" in the general online or in-person consumer oriented or investment banking oriented personnel associated with the financial services businesses.","And there has been relatively little in the way of new hedge fund growth. There's been a lot of private equity growth and there's been a lot of alternative asset management growth on -- numerically those are not a lot of bodies. And you've seen tremendous amounts of technology businesses growing in these cities because the labor forces are there. And we've said this all repeatedly further glass four or five years, is that we clearly are in the business of trying to put ourselves in a position to take advantage of the growing customers that are in our marketplaces. And those happen to be technology and in the case of Boston and a place like South San Francisco life science companies.","And so it's very natural for us to see a continuation of that. And we're seeing, the same group of kinds of customers that are -- they're growing in San Francisco and now in LA and now in Boston and now in New York, having similar name associated with them, which is, those are the -- I guess the effectively the largest tech titans in the country these days. And they have significant plans for expansion.","Owen Thomas","Steve, my own view of it is that we read what you read. We're not experts on JPMorgan strategy with respect to its personnel. However, I would say the following, JPMorgan as well as all the major banks in New York always are outsourcing some of their workforce to other cities around the country. And so, I don't think there's any 'new news' in that. I would just say it's probably the 2019, 2020 version of that trend that's been going on for years. So, I still think that the banks are concluding that New York is the place they need to be headquartered for a variety of talent and client reasons.","In terms of the broader picture, what we believe is going on is that many traditional businesses like banking are using technologies and are able to grow their businesses with fewer people. And most of the job growth that we're seeing in the U.S. today is being -- is in the whole technology areas because these companies are creating all of the innovations that are making some of the traditional industries more efficient.","And so, if you look at the job growth figures for the United States, this cycle, tech and life science has been very large and a lot of the legacy industries like financial services has been pretty flat. And therefore, if you take that into office demand though, no one prints these figures. I've said before on this call and certainly publicly that I think most of, if not all of net absorption, this cycle in the office business has come from technology, life science and shared workspace operators.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks. And I guess just kind of going back to some of the questions on guidance and maybe for Mike or for Doug, just in terms of what's sort of peeling that onion back on the same store. I'm just trying to get a better sense for, I guess it sounded like Doug, there was a little bit of speculative maybe leasing or things to come at the high end of the range. And I'm just trying to sort of figure out roughly how much or what the wiggle room is, to either get to the low end or the high end. I realized you gave a lot of detail on different markets and different tenants, but how much sort of speculative stuff needs to occur to get to the high end.","Doug Linde","So I don't know how you define speculative, Steve, so if it's not signed, I guess it's speculative, right? So we have a high degree of comfort with the rains that we provided. And the low-end of the range is the stuff that we have much more clarity on and the high end of the range has stuff that we don't have quite as much clarity on. And there's a little bit of expectation on -- as Ray and his team in Washington DC moved towards completing the transaction they're working on. But more importantly, getting some of the available space absorbed. And similarly we have other transactions like that as I described in Mountain View and in Waltham, which are clearly more speculative. And I think I did a pretty good job of describing where those square footage is on a relative basis are grounded. And you can put a rent number to those square footages and come up with a percentage of what you think is going to get done in the year and you can sort of get to the top end of our range, which is how we got there ourselves.","Mike LaBelle","And Steve, there's always speculative components of our guidance. I mean we always have to make these assumptions every year and every quarter when we give guidance about what might get done, what could get done and how we build that. So, I wouldn't say that the process or the analytics that we've done through this time is any different from what we do. Obviously, the set of opportunities we have is different every quarter and every year. But the process we go through to come up with that is similar.","Steve Sakwa","Yes. I wasn't trying to imply that there was something sort of inaccurate or guesswork on the guidance. Just trying to get a sense for how much is already kind of baked in. And then, how much is sort of on the comm., but we can circle back. I guess just lastly, is the rates to kind of 3 Hudson Boulevard and maybe for Ray, just 2100 Pennsylvania, I know 2100 Pennsylvania is well leased, but the prospects for the balance of that space and then just sort of the discussions on 3 Hudson Boulevard.","Ray Ritchey","At 2100 Penn, we don't deliver it for another two and a half years and we have more requests for proposals for the space than we have space. And we haven't even taken to the market yet. The demand for first-class brand new space in the best locations in the city is as strong as I've ever seen it, is the kind of device the overall image -- version of the market. But at 2100 Penn, we just wished we had three or four more of them.","Owen Thomas","John Powers, why don't I turn it to you for 3 Hudson Boulevard?","John Powers","Yes. 3 Hudson Boulevard, we're still underway with their foundations. We had a couple of delays with that, but we expect to have that done sometime probably early in the second quarter. We're about 95% CDs now. We have lobby finishes and whatever, they're not finally selected, but the actual building is pretty much designed. I don't know, a dozen, probably presentations, to uses all over 300,000 feet. Buildings have been very, very well received. We're very, very proud of it, very excited about it, later than some of the developments that's there now. We're probably a year and a half to two years behind other developments. If we went forward, which we have not committed to do. But, we're optimistic enough at this point that we're probably putting a steel order in for the first nine floors to give us a little quicker time to market. When we do go.","Owen Thomas","Let me just add a little bit. So, the amount of speculative new construction that was in the New York City sort of vocabulary a year ago is dramatically reduced. So, their first deal was hit at the next building at Brookfield's project. There is strong view that much of 50 Hudson Boulevard is going to be committed. There are additional deals in lease negotiation at the Spire building. So, the opportunity set is much more constricted today than it was a year ago, which I think gives us a lot more comfort that there is going to be somebody who is going to be legitimately serious about taking a slug of space from three Hudson Boulevard. Whether that's in 2020 or 2021, I don't know, in terms of when they make their commitment, but we feel a lot better about the opportunity set in front of us to get the next large requirement that is out there.","Now there are some other buildings that we're going to be competing with. We think that we have a unique kind of product that, John has described before. But, we're clearly waiting for that anchor tenant before we make any kind of commitment to move forward.","Ray Ritchey","Yes. And I would just add to that, in addition to the supply side, which Doug talked about. John mentioned all the pitches that we've already made. We also see a strong pipeline of perspective new customers that are going to be coming into the market over the next couple of years. So timing is uncertain, but we're certainly confident in the project.","Steve Sakwa","Got it. Thanks. That's it for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.","Rich Anderson","Hey, thanks. Good morning. If we could just, I know you touched on Docks 72 and everything that's going on there with Wegmans and all that. But, it's been sitting at the, WeWork 33% pre-leased forever. And I'm wondering your level of concern there in terms of attracting new tenancy in the face of WeWork problems. Is there an indirect issue to be concerned about? Is there a direct issue about WeWork sort of backing away to some degree. Would you be willing to bring in FLEX by Boston Properties to supplement some of that? Just any kind of moving part type of commentary would be interesting. Thanks.","Doug Linde","So, on a Dock 72 clearly the lease up of this property has been slower than we expected. That being said is an incredibly high quality offering and building. And we haven't fully completed it yet. The buildings open, WeWork is taking occupancy, but all the amenities in the project are not even completed yet. So it's a great show. It had great views. It's got every amenity you can imagine. It's got a fairy at the end of the dock. And I think it's an emerging office location. So Doug talked about the Wegmans opening, the Navy Yard people have done a wonderful job on all of their place making. And we're confident in this project for the longer term.","In terms of WeWork they have opened their facility and they started to sell desks and they're off to a good start. And then I talk to them more specifically about WeWork in my comments.","Rich Anderson","Yes, okay. Mike, [indiscernible] debt to EBITDA number that's -- I know it's your comfort zone, but it is a turn or two higher than the REIT average. Is that sort of designed to go lower as developments go operational and the denominator goes up or are you comfortable in that six-ish kind of range for the long-term?","Mike LaBelle","I think we are comfortable for the long-term with the range we're in right now. I also think that and we've talked about this before, if we were to not do any new investment and we just let everything get built and leased and stabilized our debt to EBITDA would be below six. So we look at prospective, we look at an existing net debt to EBITDA and prospective net debt to EBITDA, when we kind of think about our balance sheet capacity. And we believe that because of the quality of our asset, the length of our cash flows that the company can support a leverage ratio between 6x and 7x. We're very, very comfortable with our credit ratings with our leverage in those ranges. So I would not anticipate us longer term necessarily operating in a different zone.","Doug Linde","And Rick, just to be clear about what Owen said before, that the reason we're doing these joint ventures on some of our new developments and some of our new asset acquisitions is explicitly because we're thoughtful and we want to be prudent about what our overall leverage ratio is on a long-term going forward basis. And so we just -- we feel like it's the prudent thing for us to be doing is to be managing those levels.","Rich Anderson","Fair enough. And then, last for me, if we're looking at 8% FFO growth next year what would that translate to at the AFFO line? Would it be -- and maybe you could just answer higher or lower than 8%?","Mike LaBelle","I mean, I think I can get into it a little bit more than that. We're three quarters of the way through 2019 and so we've got pretty good visibility, where 2019 is as, we look at the fourth quarter and we think about what the leasing costs are going to be and what the capital is. So I would suggest at the end, for 2019 we're going to be somewhere in the 450 to 460 a share range for AFFO.","And then, if you think about what we told you about -- in 2019 just to digress, we gained about 130 basis points of occupancy during the year, which is a pretty significant occupancy game. So, the leasing transaction costs that we incurred to both keep the portfolio at its same place, deal with the rollover and increased that occupancy was more significant than it might normally be because of that occupancy game.","In 2020 I've told you that our occupancy gain is expected to be 100 basis points, so slightly less. So I would anticipate that the leasing costs in 2020 could be less than 2019, moderately less. As we think about CapEx, our CapEx this year compared to our CapEx next year, I think they will be similar honestly, it's somewhere around a $100 million, maybe $110 million for CapEx.","And then, if you think about non-cash rents, I've given you guidance for that. So, year-to-year non-cash rents are basically flat. They're pretty similar. So, if you kind of think about those three things and then you think about our FFO growth, basically all dropped to AFFO. So, our FFO growth at $0.56, I think it was at the midpoint -- is almost a $100 million. And so my anticipation is that, we would get most of that to drop into our AFFO line. And so if you compute that, we could be at $5 maybe a little bit higher than $5 next year on an FFO basis.","Rich Anderson","Great. Great color. Thanks very much.","Mike LaBelle","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Great. Hey Doug, you mentioned something interesting about TI dollars and free rent dollars. So, if you look at big picture and you say what it costs to move a Class A tenant into a building. You add TI, [FF&E] [ph], architectural engineering fees, technology costs. And I don't know if that's a $200 a foot, $300 a foot, but you can tell us.","And then how much of that cost is covered by either the TI allowance or the free rent. And what I'm curious about is whether the tenants coming out of pocket for when it's all said and done, 0% of the costs or 50% of the overall cost to get them relocated.","Doug Linde","So John, you ask a complicated question, it will be hard for me to answer it in a queer blurb. So, let me just give you the following thoughts. So, number one is that, every one of these markets is different and the markets that are stronger have a very different tenant improvement allowance and free rent construct in the markets that are less strong. So, as an example, in Boston CBD today for an existing building with vacancy we might only be giving $5 to $7 a square foot of TI for a 10-year term. And we're giving no free rent. And depending upon when the lease expires, we may be giving some amount of build out time for that period of time. So, if it's costing 200 plus dollars a square foot and we're giving 70 bucks and we're simply giving you the time to build out your space, the tenant is paying for a significant portion of that, okay?","Juxtaposing that to the weakest market from a transaction cost perspective, which is Washington DC, where in the CBD for a tenant going into a piece of space, they're getting an allowance of $120 to $140 a square foot, and they're also getting free rent of 12 to 15 months on top of their build out time. So, in that marketplace, a significant portion. So if the rent on a new building is call it, $70 on a gross basis and we're giving them a 140, then it's 210 bucks a square foot and they're probably covering a significant portion for a 15-year term in a building in Washington DC, which is just sort of the norm.","So, I think it varies significantly, but by and large in San Francisco and in New York City and in Boston, both CBD and suburban free rent is not really part of the equation for those transactions in terms of \"covering the costs,\" in Washington DC it's more of a market phenomenon.","John Guinee","Great answer. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Good morning. Just a quick -- a few quick questions here. One, I think you touched on it earlier, some of your general thoughts on continuing the LA investments, but to the extent that you would look at developments out there, do you think that you would have projects that would be sort of the typical Boston size, call it over 500,000 square feet, or the stuff that you're seeing would be more of a boutique nature, smaller building sizes, you'd look to expand your presence in that market.","Owen Thomas","Hey Alex. It's Owen. We'd certainly like to do the larger projects as possible is not easy. We would look at something smaller if we felt like it would lead us into a broader program, whether associated with the property or the groups that we're working with. So, we would consider both.","Ray Ritchey","And we've taken a hard run at both larger scale projects and one off boutique type projects as well.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then Ray, while I have you there, your comments on DC or obviously, you guys always do well there on leasing, for new building and certainly at Reston town center, but just thinking about the overall market, it always seems like musical chairs. Are you seeing in DC similar to like New York where TIs and the landlord concessions that they're offering to retain tenants are increasing? Or is it just that as tenants come up, leave Reston town center aside, they just want new construction and therefore no matter what an existing landlord is going to offer those tenants will seek to go to new construction?","Ray Ritchey","I think, it's a very bifurcated market. And even our own portfolio, I think it's important to note that, we have six buildings that we own 100% of that is 98% leased and these are newer or recently renovated first-class buildings. And those buildings are doing exceedingly well.","We also have in our portfolio three buildings that we own in joint ventures with others that are struggling. So, even with our own portfolio, we have the best in class leases at the highest rents and maintain the highest level of occupancy and the more commodity plays we're struggling. And I think it's clearly a tale of two cities on both the new construction and the existing there is a need and demand for higher tenant improvements. But, we tend to get the rates for them when we give those higher concessions on the base rent. So again, two markets, the commodity space little more challenged. The top tier space is doing exceedingly well.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho.","Tayo Okusanya","Hi. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to talk about kind of the outlook beyond 2020. I mean great details in regards to guidance for 2020, but specifically on the development side, when I look at deliveries in '21, '22, I think the development disclosure is pretty good than a lot of those assets are filled up. But how do we kind of start thinking about potential new developments spend in 2020 that's the result in additional deliveries in kind of like 2022 just kind of given the strong demand you've seen in most of your markets.","Doug Linde","So, Tayo, this is Doug. So, Owen described the new assets that I think went into our supplemental disclosure this quarter and we provide dates for those. We have a pretty healthy pipeline of other opportunities that we are looking at across all of our portfolios. And we have a number of \"land positions\" that we hope to translate into development. I think most of that stuff, if we started it in 2020 would have a 2022 to 2023 delivery, but I'll give you some examples.","So the 4th and Harrison site, which would be 500,000 square feet in San Francisco, the Platform 16 site in San Jose, which would be somewhere just under 500,000 square feet. The Back Bay station site that we currently -- we're working on permitting in Boston is a almost 700,000 square foot piece of space. The next phase of development in Reston would probably be residential, but there's a 500,000 square foot potential building to build, 3 Hudson Boulevard is a 2 million square foot piece of space. So, that would be a 2024, kind of a delivery.","So, there is a lot of stuff and that's in land that we currently control. You would not be surprised to hear me say that there are other things that the organization is working on in all of our submarkets to get additional pieces of development potential that we could get going, either, sooner or later. And they are -- there are millions of square feet of space that are currently being discussed internally in Northern Virginia, in greater Waltham, in the San Francisco submarket, in New York City, that are all important components to even more growth. Clearly, none of it would come online before 2022 or 2023 at the earliest.","Tayo Okusanya","Great. Thank you.","Owen Thomas","Okay. I think that concludes all the questions and certainly concludes management's remarks. Thank you all for your attention and your interest in Boston Properties. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect and thank you for attending."],"3534":["Boston Properties, Inc.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.","On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share a $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full-year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages.","However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above averages.","Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We have another quarter of positive rent rollups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease.","Now moving to the economy, U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but as we all know, it\u2019s been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter, an estimate for all of 2016 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit up 2.6%, though inflation remains low at 1.1% for the third quarter.","Moving to capital markets, the ten-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.25% from lows in July, which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5%-plus over the past month. Though the Fed is signaling one rate hikes for year end, further increases in the short to medium-term, we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S., and low inflation.","Given the growth in U.S. economy, office markets nationally continue to improve albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter, but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year, and our 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market.","Moving to private real estate capital markets, we believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets in gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market.","Commodity assets are more difficult to sell and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophy. There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, which is a 300,000 square foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund advisor for a $1,020 per square foot in the mid-4%s cap rate.","In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 100 First Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950 a square foot, which is a low 4%s cap rate. And finally, in West LA, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for a $1,080 per square foot, and a low to mid-4%s cap rate, and there\u2019s a pipeline of additional deals in the West LA market we think with similar pricing metrics.","We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market even Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rate spreads to treasuries remain above the long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets.","So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive, but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly. So it will likely remain low and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, but somewhat diminished from previous quarters.","Given this economic picture, we will continue to take advantage of a reasonably healthy tenets demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new development. We\u2019ll focus our new investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in the innovation centers, where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring preleasing for new office developments, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets, and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels.","Moving to the execution of our capital strategy, as you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West LA last quarter. We\u2019ve had a very \u2013 we\u2019ve had very strong leasing activity of the project and are completing our redevelopment plan. We are also actively seeking to grow West LA into another major region for Boston Properties over the long-term and are reviewing a number of on and off-market opportunities. However, we will remain disciplined and patient and focus only on investments that create attractive returns for shareholders.","Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone, the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington D.C. We\u2019ve reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and we\u2019ll retain the leasing and management of the property.","Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million, or $581 a square foot, and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its repositioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IIR on the portion we sold over our 18-year period of ownership. We\u2019re also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction.","We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our Broad Run Business Park in in Loudoun County for $18 million. And finally, we\u2019ve withdrawn from the market our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenet in the park, U.S. Customs issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia.","The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenet diminished investor interest in the assets, so ultimately, we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016, though we intend to continue to sell non-core assets in 2017 subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of three assets for total gross proceeds on an our share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year.","Moving to development, we remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our pre-development pipeline, and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square foot low-rise building in 601 Lexington Avenue, 195,000 square foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated Street entrance and lobby providing branding opportunities for major tenant.","The building is being re-clad creating 30% more vision glass, a new high efficiency HVAC system will be installed, and access to the building\u2019s extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped with a prominent at great entrance on 53rd Street will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center.","Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million, and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail and outdoor plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realized in lease rate and velocity due to this new amenity for our three major office assets at the 53rd Street \u2013 at 53rd Street Lexington Avenue.","We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor \u2013 existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we are in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building on the site.","Total budgeted development costs are $517 million, or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value. In the first-year development, NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments in projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center.","We\u2019re pursuing \u2013 further, we\u2019re pursuing multiple new prelease development opportunities in the Washington D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries, this month we delivered into service 1265 Main Street and Waltham, Mass. This \u2013 the building, which we own in partnership with a local developer is 115,000 square feet and a 100% leased to C&J Clark. We are generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment.","At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consist of eight new projects and two redevelopments, totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7%, and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company\u2019s growth over the next three years.","So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the development and delivery of new buildings, as well as the lease up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected non-core assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement.","We have significant entitled and un-entitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remains strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters.","So let me turn the call over to Doug for further review of our markets.","Douglas Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I\u2019m going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that\u2019s behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short-term, as well as those situations, where we have, in fact, completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018, and there\u2019s a significant amount of that.","In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues, and I want to take the time to provide incremental impact of those decisions.","So let me now give you some specifics on our regions, and I\u2019ll start with San Francisco. So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet at Embarcadero Center. During the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases, and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spread we\u2019ve been reporting in our quarterly supplemental.","The incremental revenue from the deals we\u2019ve now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year is over $16.5 million, and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of 2017. So overall market conditions we\u2019ve been describing in the last few quarters and the San Francisco CBD really remain the same. And while it may make a headline to write that the rate of activity in 2016 is not going to be quite at the level it was in 2015, which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014.","We actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology companies lease expansion in addition to the traditional lease exploration driven market demand. This quarter, Twitch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet; Fitbit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lift has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started our building 680 Folsom and a 11,000 square foot pre-built suite in 2014 is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet; and NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet.","Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality well built sublet spaces hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served as the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistic last quarter was 400,000 square foot block at 211 Main. Well, Schwab renewed, so there\u2019s no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over \u2013 Twitter\u2019s buildings upon Upper Market and it appears now that space has been put under lease negotiation with a growing startup technology company.","Sublet availability has remained flat with growing technology expansion compensating for additional availability. Sales force power is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breath of vision glass, the calm three floors, the volume of the slab the slab height and the views.","We have five floors under lease negotiation, which is what our expectation was for the year, and hope to have all of these leases signed by year end. Only one full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it\u2019s all incremental new demand.","The structure of the building is up about 56 floors, and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. I said this last quarter, but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of 2017, and then we have four future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of 2018.","We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their build out on a floor by floor basis, even though we\u2019re going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume, we\u2019re not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other four tenet floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter, with accompanying cessation of capitalized interest, but it\u2019s offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in 2019, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million.","Our Mountain View activity continues to be very strong still. We\u2019re renewing our single storey product at over $55 triple net, so the occupancy gains are slower at 611 Gateway, we will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we\u2019re unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in 2017.","Going down the coast to our new markets in West LA, activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 \u2013 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days, and extending another 190,000 square feet.","The West LA market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth, as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies, and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach.","Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases and there\u2019s another 790,000 square feet of activity in the market, including our transactions in process. Rents have moved more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July.","I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 250 West 55th, we have signed the lease for 55,000, including the second floor with the operator of an experiential, thematic visitor destination that expects to be open by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates, but the space is leased. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months.","At 767 5th, we have more clarity on the timing of the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver the space to Under Armour in the second-half of 2018. So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO Schwarz lease when all of the retail was released, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors building. All this space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenue.","In the second-half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue with a pretty conservative projection for percentage rents from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. We\u2019re not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our Midtown office portfolio in 2017. The conditions we have been describing for the last few years remain in control. New supply continues to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures and in certain instances, they\u2019ve chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far West Side creating additional inventory.","Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Hogan Lovells at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet being the most recent example. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across Midtown, while the market for space over $100 a square obviously has less velocity.","I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that, we have seen a significant pick up in demand for our two floors, the available floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, which totaled about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution, we actually expect to get it signed today. And we have three other tenants looking at between 40,000 and 20,000 square feet. Again, we won\u2019t recognize revenue in 2017, but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet.","If you look at it statistically, there\u2019s actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100 a square foot. And that even excludes the Citadel lease at $425, more than, in fact, in 2015, but the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet. So you have to do a lot of deals to lease space.","Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We\u2019re negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at $599 priced in the 80\u2019s, and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in 2017. We completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low-rise at 159 East \u2013 159 East 53rd Street. This was our one opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces.","In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision proceed with this investment in late 2015, we recognized that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million, that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing in 2017. We\u2019re now marketing 195,000 square foot block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in 2018 with revenue commencing in 2019.","At 399 Park Avenue, we\u2019ve commenced an extensive renovation and have leased about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 0.5 million square feet that is uncommitted, including about 100,000 square feet of concourse space that\u2019s currently rented at about $45 a square foot.","The existing lease expirations from Citi and the law firm expire in August and September of 2017. And while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvements and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have a very modest near-term expirations or vacancies. We\u2019ve signed leases or negations ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income, but the opportunities to drive 2017 revenue are limited.","Going down to D.C. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experienced much in the way of new demand generators. And we haven\u2019t really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market. Landlords are competing on any available space and concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more typically include a year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowances. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizeable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That\u2019s the market we\u2019re dealing with.","The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to its renewal and we\u2019re not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We\u2019re negotiating short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease expirations. In spite of the challenging environment, we\u2019re chipping away at all of our availability with about half of the 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mass, that\u2019s the building that opened late last September. And we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet either signed or in active negotiations on our other D.C. asset \u2013 CBD asset.","In Reston, we completed another six leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rent still is in the mid-50s. And we have made two proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 Signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There\u2019s actually been a pick up of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing, and we\u2019re actually in negotiations with two tenants for between 53,000 and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. And we also picked up another 31,000 square foot tenant at our AJ 6 building in Maryland.","As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease for an approximately 476,000 square foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square foot office building 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the City of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of 2017, and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board $2.3 million of income on an annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projection. I think you\u2019re starting to get the theme.","The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continues to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality space is at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in 2017. One of our negotiations is for our building at 173 Tracer Lane, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment.","We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase the income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of a purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value.","The Boston CBD market continues to be a lease expiration-driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of the more interesting phenomenon is that all the large users that have been entering the \u201cInnovation District, or the Seaport area\u201d are for the most part traditional FIREA tenants seeking new large blocks of space and most of the smaller and growing technology companies have located in the Financial District, uptown, which is what we call the North Station area, or the Backbay.","During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio. But this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Boylston Street, again, I think the lease will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We\u2019ve signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98%, and we\u2019ve signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon.","As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when Natixis occupies floors 4 through 10, or 154,000 square feet. And while we\u2019ve leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011 and it\u2019s a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high-rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease expiration-driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 months, but we are not projecting revenue in 2017.","In summary, we\u2019ve executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operating properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming years. We\u2019ve now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge, but we still have a few significant lease expirations that were part of that bridge that we will still need to cover.","And with that, I will turn the call to Mike.","Michael LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I\u2019m just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I will jump to our earnings results and our guidance.","We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We raised a $1 billion 10-year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all-in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay two mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%. So you will see the impact of the 240 basis point reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward.","Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017, and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit, or raising additional debt capital as a partial funding source.","Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line. Though it\u2019s certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short-term, which would be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in Treasury rates over the past couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it would reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share.","The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 5th Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture with our share being 60%, and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%.","With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We\u2019ve also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10-year Treasury rate of 2.60% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should enter into our cash flow.","Our earnings for the quarter were reported at $1.42 per share, which was a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI of approximately $3 million above our projection, due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operating expense savings.","The majority of the revenue beat came from San Francisco, where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with strong rollups that we started to straight line upon signing. As you can see in our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent rollups on our activity in San Francisco.","The outperformance in the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own in a land assemblage we have considered exiting over the past several years, having sold two other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million.","Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016 of $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter\u2019s guidance. All of the increase emanates from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco markets. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% over 2015, which is at the high end of our prior range.","As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion\u2019s share of this came from one large termination at 250 West 55th Street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income. So this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017.","In the portfolio, Doug described our activity in New York City and Boston, where we\u2019re successfully signing leases and letters of intent, but much of the impact will be in 2018. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same property portfolio in 2017.","In Boston, we\u2019ve signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Eataly and the rest of the Prudential shops\u2019 releasing effort to be open and revenue-generating by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street and we expect moderate additional lease up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity adds $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017.","In San Francisco, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016, but will be even stronger in 2017, where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region.","On a cash basis, the growth is even greater as the cash mark-to-market takes hold on our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we are experiencing in Boston and San Francisco from both increased occupancy and a rollup to higher rental rates is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat.","As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we are doing at 767 5th Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of rollover at 399 Park Avenue in the second-half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million in 2017 from 2016.","So, in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same-property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016. And on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same-property NOI over the same period.","Our non-same property portfolio includes our [Audio Gap] and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include 159 East 53rd Street in New York; 145 Broadway in Cambridge; and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect these redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment, but in 2017 will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of NOI compared to 2016. This includes both lost rental income, as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we project at $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017.","On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full-year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries. Though, as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017.","The other area, where we expect significant change in our earnings in 2017 is through lower interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing completed in 2016, as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint from 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017.","So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same property portfolio; $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions; $0.12 per share from lower interest expense; a penny per share from higher development and management services income that we project to be offset by a reduction of $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income.","Again the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that is not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016.","I also want to make a quick comment on our dividend. Our estimate for 2016 taxable income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We\u2019ve been working with our Board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short-term and the longer-term to continue to match our taxable income to our dividend.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Owen, just the first question is with the JV with Blackstone down at Metropolitan Square in D.C., can you just give a little bit more perspective on sort of how we should think about the relationship with Blackstone? Is this going to be where, as they have buildings that they are putting on the market, we may see you guys partner and buy into those buildings, or is it more selling parts of your portfolio, or is it the two companies both going out and pursuing new acquisitions together?","Owen Thomas","Yes, I \u2013 good morning, Alex. Look, I think that we\u2019ve done actually two important transactions with Blackstone this year. We purchased the half interest in Colorado Center from them and we are doing this recapitalization at Metropolitan Square. I don\u2019t think I would read anything more into it than just that. Clearly, we have a good relationship and a tremendous amount of respect for Blackstone and we are very open and welcome to doing new business together. But I think it will be very situation","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, on LA for future investment, your comments sounded a little bit as though we should be patient. But maybe you could just frame some perspective just, when you look at the companies out there, whether it\u2019s Dougie or Hudson, they are buying like individual deals, or maybe a portfolio like Westwood, but a number of the properties that meet sort of the Boston criteria don\u2019t seem as widespread, at least to those of us. So maybe if you could just provide a little bit more perspective on what you guys see as the opportunity set both in aggregate and then maybe as far as timing if it\u2019s something that\u2019s within \u2013 we should wait another six months, or it may be another 12 plus before we see more investment?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So the strategy, as you know, and as we\u2019ve been articulating is the investment in Colorado Center isn\u2019t one-off. I mean, we clearly feel that we are going to make a profitable investment in Colorado Center, which is great and was certainly one of the objectives, and the other objective was to get us into the LA market, which we think will be an attractive and important market for the company over the long term.","But we don\u2019t intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in LA. Each investment, as Colorado Center did has to stand on its own, and in our opinion create attractive returns for shareholders. And so what I think and if you also look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late 1990s and it still is the smallest region of all \u2013 of the four primary markets of the company; here we are nearly 20 years later.","So our intent is to grow. We view the investment in LA as strategic, but we are going to wait for opportunities that, again, we think make sense and cancel from a return perspective. And so where we are in the market today, I don\u2019t think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilized assets in a 4% kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we are going to be doing.","We are going to be looking at new developments. We are going to be looking at assets that need some repositioning or lease-up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West LA, and I don\u2019t think you should put a confined timeframe on it like 6 months or 12 months, we are going to be careful and patient and wait for the right opportunity.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Owen. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Mike, a question for you. How much taking the properties out to put them into the redevelopment pool instead of same-store pool impact same-store growth? Said differently, if you hadn\u2019t re-classed them and you said these are properties we own, we are doing work, but they are coming out of the pool, what would same-store growth be then?","Michael LaBelle","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that significant 2016 to 2017. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about $8 million of reduction. I think that if we didn\u2019t pull them out in the 2015 to 2016 at this point, I mean, it will probably come out in the fourth quarter, so we will have one quarter of 601 being out for the low-rise, which will be \u2013 which is \u2013 will be a little bit of impact. I think, which will have a little bit of an impact. But I would say, it\u2019s 25 basis points maybe to 50 basis points something like that.","Emmanuel Korchman","Okay. And on Colorado Center, you said you have deals that are close. How much capital is it going to take to get those deals in place, or is it going to be just more normal TI type spend?","Douglas Linde","So the deals that we have in place are not legally conditioned on us doing any work to the exterior areas of the buildings. There\u2019s a tenant improvement contribution for each of the deals and I think the \u2013 I mean, the general market is in the $70 to $80 a square foot for a 10-year deal and it\u2019s closer to $100 a square foot for a 15-year deal.","And but we intend to do a major repositioning of the properties and we have a plan that we\u2019ve come up with that we\u2019ve discussed with TIA who are the other party in the transaction and we don\u2019t have a firm budget on that yet, but it\u2019s somewhere \u2013 more than $10 million and probably less than $25 million, and we will have to come to an agreement internally and with them on what the right amount of spend is and how long it will take. But that will be more of a global repositioning as opposed to what\u2019s required for these deals. These deals don\u2019t have any requirement from a legal perspective to spend money.","Michael LaBelle","Manny, the number is about 50 basis points. It\u2019s about $8 million on about $1.350 billion of our share same-store.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks, Mike. Last one for me. Is there any agreement with salesforce in place, or any option in place where if they want more space at Salesforce Tower, they get it, or is it a new negotiation for new space?","Douglas Linde","So our lease with salesforce.com includes just the space that they have on, quote unquote their existing lease. So we have the unfettered right to lease other space to other tenants. You would think that the major 800,000 square foot tenant would be an important customer. And so to the extent we are doing things on other parts of the building, we are letting them know what\u2019s going on. So to the extent that they have an interest in that space. They can give us their view on how we might work with them on it.","Emmanuel Korchman","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Thomas Lesnick","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, going back to the discussion about financing for 2017, and specifically mortgage debt, can you comment at all on what the appetite for balance sheet debt by life cos looks like relative to the CMBS market right now?","Owen Thomas","I think both have strong appetites. I think the CMBS market has come back very strong in the summertime after kind of a weak volatile first quarter and beginning of the second quarter and life companies were actually holding back a little bit, because they wanted to have a more even outflow. So they kind of held back in the first-half and now CMBS is more competitive than they are. You\u2019ve got swap rates that are below Treasury rates and you\u2019ve got \u2013 the \u2013 for leverage rates that are 50% to 60%, the spreads are very, very tight on CMBS, so they\u2019re competitive.","So I think now the life companies are trying to become more competitive and put out capital. They have more to put out by the end of the year. So I think it\u2019s pretty competitive. I think that when we look at 767 5th Avenue, that\u2019s a big loan. That is going to be more aligned with the CMBS market, I would imagine, because you would have to put together many other life companies to put that together given its size and the fact that most life companies are maxing out at a couple hundred million to maybe $400 million at most, or we could do a large kind of bank loan transaction, which is actually what we have today when we originally did the deal.","Thomas Lesnick","Got it. Appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. And then my other question, on the redevelopment of the low-rise at 601 Lex, how are you guys thinking about positioning rents for that space relative to kind of a \u2013 in the wide range of rents in Midtown?","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to take that one?","John Powers","That\u2019s a very unique product and we are very, very excited about it. It\u2019s got light and air, but no views. It\u2019s got a very good location. So that will be positioned to be in the high 80s. [Multiple Speakers] and as 10% of the entire space is outdoor space [indiscernible].","Thomas Lesnick","Great. Thank you very much.","John Powers","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Owen or Doug, it sounds like you guys have a lot of situations where the lag between signed leases and occupancy or innovation are delaying the recognition of income. But on the flipside, can you talk about anywhere that you think maybe there\u2019s currently vacant space that could be leased quick enough to become income-producing before the end of the year and maybe provide some upside to guidance?","Douglas Linde","So I\u2019m hesitant to answer that question too aggressively, because the circumstances under which we deliver the space are so critical to when we recognize or have the ability to recognize revenue. So we can sign leases and be in a position where the space is committed, and if we deliver the space in one condition, we are recognizing revenue day one and if we are delivering it after having removed the existing improvements, it could be 10 months, or 12 months, or 6 months delayed.","So Mike\u2019s numbers have some of that baked into them in terms of his projections for our same-store growth for the year, but it\u2019s pretty muted because of the issues associated with the delivery conditions. So I think we will do more leasing. I don\u2019t know whether or not we will be able to get impact from it in our 2017 numbers.","Blaine Heck","Okay. Fair enough. And then it looked as though CapEx was higher than normal again this quarter and I know it can be a little bit of a lagging indicator since it\u2019s on leases commenced during the quarter. But can you guys just talk a little bit more \u2013 you touched on it in New York. But what are you seeing in each of your markets with respect to concessions and are you getting any pushback in any of the markets to increase free rent or TIs?","Douglas Linde","So I would tell you that overall in our markets, if you had to pick a direction, concessions are moderately up as opposed to moderately down. I think in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we\u2019ve been working with for a number of years and pre-building space, and if you pre-build the suite, you are giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you are giving an allowance. But in theory you are reducing the free rent concession significantly and or improving your velocity.","I described the transaction environment in Washington DC. It\u2019s pretty close to where it was last year, maybe it\u2019s slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market, it\u2019s actually \u2013 concessions have come down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place on average is a more economical experience for them because of the cost associated with having to relocate.","So if you have a tenant in place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then in the Boston market, the CBD is \u2013 probably had slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers not significant. Pre-rent really hasn\u2019t become a factor in this market at all. And our suburban market actually, I think has seen a decrease overall in concessions, because \u2013 honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality space is becoming limited.","Blaine Heck","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Mike, you mentioned that you are going to do a little over 8% FFO growth next year if you exclude the termination income. And so I\u2019m wondering whether FFO or AFFO growth could get even better than that in 2018 and beyond since you still have a fair amount of releasing of vacancy and development NOI to hit, which I think is a greater amount of benefit after 2017?","Michael LaBelle","I think that we don\u2019t want to talk too much about 2018. But I think if you look at what we have, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of space at 200 Clarendon and 120 St. James that is today roughly 350,000 square feet of availability that is zero today, which is meaningful space.","So I think that -- and we\u2019ve got some other rollups in Boston, suburban Boston and Cambridge. So I think the Boston market will do very well. I think San Francisco will continue to do well. We have dealt with a lot of our rollover, but we\u2019ve still got a little bit more to go that has rollups and we still have a few floors of vacant space. And then in New York City, Doug talked about 767 and 250 West 55th Street.","Now we do have to release the 399 Park space. So depending on how quickly that comes in, that could be a negative for that year. And then, obviously, our development pipeline, we will have a full run rate of 888 Boylston Street and then salesforce will start to have a real impact to us. I think there\u2019s some very positive things for 2018.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess just one other one on Salesforce Tower. Can you go back and explain a little bit more about \u2013 someone was talking about the operating expense, I guess hitting for the full building at some point I think at the end of 2017, along with the removal of capitalized interest and is that an issue that affects 2017 much, or is that more of a 2018 issue?","Michael LaBelle","The way that we capitalize taxes are that we continue to capitalize them on the percentage of the space that is not leased up to 12 months basically after we deliver the building. But the other \u2013 most of the other operating expenses, you do have to start to ramp up for utilities and other things and you can\u2019t capitalize those types of things. So in the very beginning of your occupancy, you have a tough time getting positive NOI. But obviously as you lease up, you start to get that leverage.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And just quickly, could we also just get the capitalized interest assumption for 2017? Thanks.","Michael LaBelle","I think we said $50 million to $60 million of capitalized interest for 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I guess just to start, Doug, did I hear you say that you are $72 million done of the $80 million leasing target for the repositioning NOI?","Douglas Linde","Yes, so what I \u2013 so we\u2019ve been keeping this running total and so we\u2019ve done $72 million of $80 million on the revenue side. But remember number there\u2019s a net reduction from some leases that were expiring that sort of go against that. So I\u2019m giving you a gross number, not a net number. So there\u2019s another call it $15 million to $17 million that\u2019s sort of part of that $80 million that we still have to get done. But on an apples-to-apples basis from what we\u2019ve been reporting from the beginning of the year, we started with zero and we\u2019ve gotten $72 million of $80 million and then we have some negatives that have come on that we have to still cover.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, Mike, you talked about a potential $0.05 drag from a debt deal early in the year. Is that in your guidance, or you are saying if you do it, it would be another drag?","Michael LaBelle","If we do it, it would be a drag. So we\u2019ve assumed in our guidance that we are using our line of credit as we need it. So we\u2019ve got some interest expense in our guidance associated with our line of credit, which we draw on as we need the money. So it gets drawn throughout the year. But it\u2019s certainly possible, again, that we could do something much sooner than that and then we would sit on the cash and the cash doesn\u2019t earn much. So I gave an example of $500 million, because that\u2019s the approximate amount of capital we would need to fund out most of our pipeline.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then do you have a view on AFFO for 2017 based on your guidance in your dividend?","Michael LaBelle","What I can give you is some of the pieces to kind of help you. If you look at our projections for what we need to lease to meet our plan, we need to lease something like 3.5 million square feet of space. So depending on how much cost you throw at that, that\u2019s probably somewhere in the $200 million plus or minus range for costs that would get hit there. Non-cash rents, we gave guidance for that of $50 million to $70 million. And I think that we would say maintenance CapEx is probably somewhere in the $60 million to $80 million range.","If you look at other non-cash expenses that we have, that would offset that probably between $35 million and $45 million. So you\u2019re talking about total adjustments to our FFO of $280 million to $320 million something like that. That would bring you down probably to, I don\u2019t know, $4.25 to $4.50 or something like that on a per share basis, just dropping that off the guidance that I guess.","Jamie Feldman","Yep. And then I guess going back to the same-store question for 2018, just kind of back of the envelope, do you guys have a sense as you were going through the numbers of where you are shaping up for 2018 same-store and what kind of pop you get over 2017 based on what\u2019s in motion?","Michael LaBelle","We\u2019ve got projections, obviously. But there\u2019s a lot that can change and a lot can happen. We don\u2019t really want to get into 2018 guidance at this point.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then my last fundamental question on New York City. You gave some interesting color on market leasing and some demand you\u2019re getting in your buildings. I think you also said the $80-ish rent market is pretty good. How are you guys thinking several years out on New York City? I guess, as everyone kind of thinks about the moving pieces in the market, how do you guys think about what you are expecting?","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to try that one first?","John Powers","Well, I\u2019m very consistent. I\u2019m very bullish on New York City. I think the New York population is going up. All the indicators here are positive. There\u2019s not as much job growth as last year, but there is job growth this year. I think the hotels are doing well and it\u2019s a very good market. So we think it will continue to draw people into the market, the tech sector, the TAMI sector is growing. So the long-term is bullish. We do have some supply, as we\u2019ve talked about, coming on with the Trade Center primarily and the rail yards and that will be absorbed over the next couple of years.","Owen Thomas","And I guess in terms of prospects to push rents, [Multiple Speakers] flatten out, do you think that continues?","John Powers","I\u2019m not bullish on rents moving up. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think there will be some areas in the city, in some particular buildings where rents will move and there will be some places that will be a little softer, but I\u2019m pretty flat overall for the next couple years on rents.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Anyone else want to chime in?","Douglas Linde","Jamie, I think we\u2019ve been saying for, I think several years now that, as John articulated, New York is a healthy market. It\u2019s a desirable city. There is job creation. I think the mix of industries is getting more diverse in a very positive way. So all that\u2019s very positive, but there is a fair amount of supply. It\u2019s significant on a square foot basis. It\u2019s less significant on a percent of total stock basis, but it matters. And so when we\u2019ve run our numbers, we see availability in New York. It\u2019s hard to push it below 10% and when you are in an environment like that, it\u2019s hard to push rents certainly above inflation and we\u2019ve been saying that and we\u2019ve been in many cases leasing our portfolio with that type of philosophy.","John Powers","Yes, that\u2019s all true. But also on the other side of that, we don\u2019t see the availability going to 12%. It takes a lot of movement to move it from 11% to 12%. So it\u2019s pushing somewhere around 11% aggregate in the city and we have some pipeline coming on over the next couple of years, small, as Owen said, a small percentage relative to the 400 million square foot market here, but nonetheless space that will impact the market. So we are going to be somewhere around a 11%. That\u2019s what the availability rate overall Manhattan is going to be at the end of the year. Fourth quarter leasing velocity will probably move up. It should hit close to the 25 million that\u2019s the average over the last 12 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Rob Simone","Hey, guys, it\u2019s Rob Simone standing in for Steve. Just kind of like stepping back and at a high level, you guys are going to do call it $1.3 billion of NOI roughly this year. And I guess our question is, once all the developments are placed in service, the biggest portion obviously being salesforce, and once you guys are through the majority or all of your planned leasing, what\u2019s kind of like the run rate cash NOI we should be or GAAP NOI that we should be thinking about looking three years out when all of this activity, which will quarter-to-quarter introduce a lot of noise to the results, is finished, what\u2019s that bogey you guys are targeting?","Douglas Linde","I\u2019m going to answer that question in a terribly unhelpful way, which is I don\u2019t think we are in a position where we feel comfortable giving you a projection three years out. We\u2019ve given you a lot of pieces and we\u2019ve described the average return on cost of our development pipeline and the delivery of those dollars.","So if you are assuming, I mean, 7% is a number that we are using as sort of a surrogate. The number is actually going to be higher than that on a GAAP basis, because we are describing cash yields and obviously cash yields don\u2019t include the increases in rents that you straight line and they don\u2019t include, as Owen, for example said, what our market land value is. That\u2019s a non-cash item, or non-GAAP item, so the numbers are going to be higher.","And if you take that and then Mike gives a pretty good same-store revenue number, I wish I could tell you that we can give you more than that, but I think that\u2019s what you are going to have to work with to come up with our three-year projection, if you want to call it that.","Rob Simone","Yes, no, no, that\u2019s helpful. I know obviously it\u2019s a long way out. I guess it\u2019s a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s just a lot of activity that\u2019s kind of happening concurrent to each other and it\u2019s also not going to be a straight line up, obviously. So, yes, that\u2019s helpful. I get it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. Just two granular questions on New York. 250 West, can you outline the prospects for the remaining space, particularly on the retail left on the ground floor that I think is helping you with?","Douglas Linde","Sure. So we have one retail space left and we have a letter of intent on that space with a restauranteur.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just any other space on the office side?","Douglas Linde","Yes. So we have on the 36th floor, which is available and half of the 35th floor. And we have discussions going on with smaller tenants on the 35th floor and we, at the moment, don\u2019t have any active conversations on the 36th floor.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just on retail going to the Plaza District, just want to get your thoughts on retail on 5th Avenue kind of around 50, 57th Street versus off-5th. And I\u2019m just trying to understand this commentary on some weakness in certain parts of Plaza, but just want to get your thoughts on how the prospects are for on-5th versus off.","Douglas Linde","So I will give you a macro answer and then, John Powers, you can provide some micro if you want. So Boston Properties has leased all of their 5th Avenue space for the next 17 or 18 years. So we are not in the market on 5th Avenue any longer. We will have a small space on Madison Avenue coming up in the middle of 2016 \u2013 2017 and another space towards the end of the year and they are both 1,000 to 3,000 square feet. And our view is that the market on Madison Avenue has gotten marginally better than where it was three or four years ago. So if three or four years ago, we thought the market was $850 to $900 a square foot, today, I think we think the market is from $1,000 to $1,200 a square foot. John, do you have any other comments?","John Powers","No, I think that covers it.","Vikram Malhotra","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Hey, good morning, guys. Just following on the New York questions. I guess what trends are you seeing in terms of net effective rents in Manhattan year-to-date and is there any difference at the high-end of the market versus kind of the more moderate price points?","Douglas Linde","I think that it depends on how you define that. So I think that the way the market is working is that when you have \u2013 and most of the Midtown activity is lease expiration-driven, there\u2019s not a tremendous amount of growth that when you have a lease expiration tenancy and they have a particular day on which their space is leasing, the market has become more flexible on meeting that date. So where it used to be that, in a bit of a stronger market, if you had a lease expiration on January 1 of 2018, and the traditional 10-year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be what the transaction package would be.","Today, if you have a lease expiration on January 30, or February 1, or March 30, or April 1, you might get the same concession package, but your rent commencement date would be a little bit drawn out. So effectively your NER, if you want to call it that, has gone down slightly, but it\u2019s, in reality, just a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions, and I think that\u2019s the flexibility that\u2019s being required.","In addition, as I said before, Jed, there is more landlord-oriented work that is going on in Manhattan in the form of pre-built or other landlord-required obligations to tenant spaces. So there has been a push-up in concessions in that way.","Jed Reagan","But you haven\u2019t necessarily seen the face rent growth to offset some of those higher concessions?","Douglas Linde","John, I don\u2019t believe we have? You can comment.","John Powers","No, I don\u2019t think we have. And, as Doug said, yes, in a market that\u2019s got some vacancy at 11% availability and some balancing between tenants and landlord, tenants still have sometimes limited opportunities. They might have two or three things even though with all the space in the market in terms of where they want to go, their size, what\u2019s available, their timing, et cetera. But because of the market we are in with this balance, landlords are pushing out and looking at future lease expirations and matching that so the tenant doesn\u2019t have double rent, as Doug said. And that pulls the NER down, but that\u2019s forward leasing and that\u2019s consistent with most lease expiration-driven markets.","Jed Reagan","Gotcha. Thanks. And can you talk a little bit about your expected disposition plans for 2017 in terms of the potential dollar value and the profile of assets you might look to sell?","Owen Thomas","I think, Jed, for 2017, we haven\u2019t finalized our disposition plan yet. But our expectation is that we will continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing for the last couple of years and that is selling non-core assets. So I would expect the volume of dispositions to be more in line with what we were doing in 2016 as opposed to a couple years ago.","Jed Reagan","I see. Okay. And then just as we look out to 2017 external growth plans, how should we think about the potential number of, or scale \u2013 aggregate scale of new development starts, and I know you mentioned a few D.C. possibilities specifically, if there\u2019s any sense of kind of how much that could aggregate?","Douglas Linde","So I will give you a range. If we are able to do nothing other than this potential lease at 145, the number is call it \u2013 what Owen said $530 million. If we are successful in generating the business that Ray is chasing in DC, there\u2019s another $0.5 billion of potential starts in calendar year 2017.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Thank you, guys. Maybe to ask the kind of out-year NOI question a different way. As you guys kind of look at the portfolio and look at what your expirations are going to be two years out, are there any kind of instances similar to what we are seeing today with 601 Lex and other places, where big blocks of space may be taken offline to redevelop kind of anything that could be a step back in terms of an offset to some of the NOI coming on?","Owen Thomas","So it\u2019s a very fair question, Craig. And I think that if we go around our portfolio and look at the amount of repositioning we have already done, the vast majority has been completed. There are a few 300,000 plus square foot buildings in Washington D.C. One of them is undergoing a renovation right now and the other one will likely start in 2019 or 2020. That\u2019s the building over on New Hampshire Avenue, right?","Douglas Linde","Yes.","Owen Thomas","And then there\u2019s a suburban office building in Boston that we actually are under \u2013 about to undergo a renovation on, but we actually got a \u2013 we have a signed lease for that building and that tenant would like to be, sorry, not a signed lease, a signed letter of intent and that tenant would like to be in that space in the third quarter of 2017, so that one is going to happen really fast.","Our CBD portfolio by and large in New York City and in Boston and in Washington D.C. aside from that one building I just described have really gone through a pretty significant restoration and refurbishment. And then we are going to be doing some work at Embarcadero Center probably over the next two or three years to really upgrade and improve the experiences there. But not in anticipation of any lease expirations just in the form of making sure we are maintaining our competitiveness with the marketplace.","Craig Mailman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to go back, Owen, to your comments about kind of the opportunities you are seeing in D.C. on the development side. I mean, could you kind of go into \u2013 is that more in the District, more in the kind of Metro more broadly and how comfortable would you be doing any development other than the build-to-suit in that market?","Owen Thomas","We are looking at opportunities in the District, in Northern Virginia and in suburban Maryland. And certainly as we have described, pre-leasing is critical for us to launch projects and even more critical if we are going to do it in the suburbs. If we have a development that is fully or materially pre-leased at an attractive yield, it\u2019s something we are certainly going to launch.","Craig Mailman","So something like north of 50% kind of a good bogey?","Owen Thomas","Oh, yes.","Douglas Linde","Craig, just to give you clear perspective. Three of the things we are looking at in D.C are 100% leased and one of them there will likely be a lease of at least 60% or 70%.","Craig Mailman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one last quick one, you guys are seeing the demand come back for the space you have at the GM building. Is there \u2013 could you just give some color on maybe is it a similar tenancy to what you guys had on the hook earlier? Did you guys have to change pricing there at all to reignite activity?","Douglas Linde","We have not changed our pricing from the deals that we were doing a year ago. So we have not raised our pricing, but we haven\u2019t lowered our pricing and the tenants are very similar. They are in what I guess Owen refers to as small financial firms, private equity firms, alternative asset management firms, consultants to the asset management business, some, quote unquote, I guess hedge funds self provide.","John Powers","We call them very attractive tenants.","Michael LaBelle","Doug, I think the only difference might be that we thought we might have to have pre-built some of the space and try to attract 5,000 to 10,000 square foot users. And as Doug described, what we are really talking to is 20,000 to 40,000 square foot users. So that\u2019s a half a floor to a full floor, so that\u2019s not really doing kind of the pre-built activity.","Douglas Linde","But we will end up doing some pre-building on those floors to fill out the space.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes form the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. Just on that subject of retail in New York. I was interested in Doug\u2019s comments on the conservative percentage rents that you see there. Can you just give us a range of what conservative means and also was that commentary for Under Armour or did that include Apple as well?","Douglas Linde","So you are never going to hear us describing what the rent is or what the sales are for any of our tenants on a particular basis, because I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate. So the number I gave you was a revenue base for all of the retail at the building, which includes a multitude of tenants, even some banks, but they don\u2019t give us percentage rent. [Multiple Speakers].","Yes, right. And so my point \u2013 I guess my point is is that we are well off what the peak sales were in terms of our expectations for the percentage rent and we haven\u2019t assumed any growth. So we said let\u2019s look at what the least exciting sales might be and use that as our baseline and everything that we get on top of that will be gravy.","John Kim","But as far as conservative, are you saying below 20%?","Douglas Linde","I\u2019m not going to give you a number, because you\u2019ve got to understand the sales for these properties are different than they are for anything else that you would probably see in a retail portfolio.","John Kim","Okay. In San Francisco, there has been a lot of media reports on the structural integrity of Millennium Tower, which neighbors Salesforce Tower. How concerned are you about this and has this impacted leasing at all?","Douglas Linde","Bob, would you like to describe that one?","Robert Pester","It\u2019s had zero impact on leasing and we are not worried about the building falling over. That\u2019s the short answer.","John Kim","In a worst-case scenario, what do you think happens?","Robert Pester","I think they pressure grout and stop the building from sinking. I think it\u2019s going to continue to sink until they come up with a solution.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Thank you. Big picture question for you guys. The \u2013 over the last 10 years, you have been highly, highly successful selling high 4% cap rates plus or minus developing to a 7% yield. Your cost of capital on an NOI basis has been a $4.5 to 5% yield. You\u2019ve paid a special dividend when necessary. And what this has done? Is this has really helped you on an NAV value creation, but has hurt in terms of FFO growth?","If you look at what\u2019s happening in the investment sale market, as I think, Owen, you pointed out at the beginning, some stunningly high prices, but very few bidders. Why aren\u2019t you taking advantage of this and really ramping up your investment sale program, given what can be happening in the market in the next couple years in the investment sale arena?","Owen Thomas","John, well, we have taken advantage of the sale market this cycle. We did several billion dollars worth of asset sales and joint ventures over the last several years and made significant special dividends to shareholders. We also \u2013 a lot of those decisions also were driven by the need we had for capital to fund our development pipeline, in which we\u2019ve been employing.","We will certainly consider selling additional assets in the future if we need the capital for a new investment that we make or for additional development. But what we are not doing is just selling assets when we don\u2019t have a need for capital. As you know, our debt is lower than where it has traditionally been and we have still substantial capital to invest in our current development pipeline.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","A - Owen Thomas","Okay. That concludes all the questions and our remarks. Thank you for your attention. That concludes the call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. We have been very active over the last few months winning important new business and in the process delivered another strong quarter which I would summarize as follows.","Delivered FFO per share $0.04 above street consensus and $0.04 above our prior forecast excluding the impact of the financing we did last quarter due to operational improvements, increase in midpoint of our full-year 2018 guidance by $0.07 after an adjustment for recent property sale.","Increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 or 7%, leased 2.4 million square feet which is significantly above our long-term quarterly average for the period, increased office portfolio occupancy by 50 basis points to 90.7%, completed an $850 million unsecured refinancing on very favorable terms, signed enhancement lease commitment and development of 20 CityPoint.","Commenced development of the Hub on Causeway residential project, signed an anchor lease commitment for 66% of the office space in our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development. And in January, signed a lease with Leidos to develop our new headquarters at 1750 President, the last remaining site in the core of Reston Town Center. Clearly we have been having a busy and productive period.","Let me first move to the macro environment. The prospects for global and U.S. growth are healthy and stable. The global economy outperformed consensus forecast last year with growth projected to be just over 3% in 2018. Though U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2.6% growth is projected to remain at a comparable level for 2018.","And we believe recent federal Tax Reform will likely provide a boost and prolong our economic recovery. Job creation also remains steady and favorable with nearly 150,000 jobs created in December and unemployment is at 4.1% at lowest level since well before the global financial crisis.","On financial markets, fears of inflation and resultant higher interest rates permeate the press and consensus thinking. Facts are, the 10 year U.S. treasury has risen only around 30 basis points this year and inflation remains fairly steady and muted at 2.1%.","Though we believe, the fed is committed to further rate hikes in 2018, Interest rates continue to be low globally and we remain skeptical of a significant upward move in long-term rates in the U.S. in the near and medium-term.","We think the impacts to Boston Properties of recent federal Tax Reform is clearly favorable certainly for the foreseeable future. Many of the features of the U.S. tax codes that are important to us and the real estate industry such as REIT status, like kind exchanges, deductibility of interest, depreciation of structure and they remain intact. Further our customer base, generally taxpaying entities will have increased earnings which should spur investments and leasing activity.","The office markets and sub markets where we operate remain in general equilibrium. However, new deliveries of office space outpaced net absorption in 2017. Doug will provide m ore specific leasing color, but the statistics for our size major markets, our net absorption for 2017 was 2.4 million square feet or about 0.4% of occupied space while deliveries were 4.8 million feet or 0.7% of stock.","Vacancy increased modestly 40 basis points to 8.4% while rents grew 3.3%. Leasing activity remains healthy with broad-based activity in both the technology and traditional industry segments.","In the private real estate equity market, office transaction volume ended 2017 down 25% from 2016 levels, primarily due to less product available in the market. Though cap rates remains reasonably stable for leased assets in our core markets, many domestic and international investors have significant capital targeting commercial real estate and we foresee healthy transaction volumes and steady pricing in 2018.","There once again were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter, a few are in Washington DC 1440 New York Avenue sold for nearly $1,200 a square foot and a mid-4s cap rate to an European institution, this is a 2,000 foot building that\u2019s fully leased.","Also in Washington a smaller 114,000 square foot building 900 G Street sold for over $1,300 a foot, a low-4s cap rate to a European high net worth buyer. This deal represents a new record price per square foot for the Washington DC market.","In downtown Santa Monica 520 Broadway which is again a little over 100,000 feet sold and it\u2019s 50% leased to rework and 84% leased overall, so for 1,036 a square foot and a 3.9% cap rate, the stabilized cap rate upon lease up will be over 5%. And El Segundo, Campus 2100 sold for $574 per square foot in the high-4s cap rate to a domestic pension advisor.","And lastly, in New York the sale of a minority interest in 1515 Broadway is under agreement at a valuation of over $1,000 a foot and a low-4s cap rate. This is a 1.8 million square foot building. It\u2019s fully leased and it\u2019s being recapped with a European institution.","Now I will move to our capital activities. Last year, we sold 31 million in non-core assets and just completed the sale of 500 E Street in Washington DC for 128 million or around 6% cap rate when incorporating capital required for existing tenant obligation assumed by the purchaser.","In 2018 we will continue to prune non-core assets and as a result upgrade our portfolio and expect to sell approximately 200 million to 300 million of property including the 500 E Street sale.","We do not anticipate a particularly active year in acquisitions, though we are always in the market reviewing deals, we would prefer to develop to 6% to 7% yield then purchase assets at a yield which is generally 200 basis points lower. Assets that require repositioning to meet our criteria and we continue to have ambition to carefully grow our footprint in LA.","Development will remain our key strategy to create value for shareholders and our development activity remains very active with many new pre-leased projects either committed or under pursuit.","As mentioned, this quarter, we added 20 CityPoint to the active pipeline. It\u2019s 211,000 square foot mirror building with 10 CityPoint in Waltham which we completed in 2015. The property is 52% pre-leased and the anchor tenant is projected to occupy in the third quarter of 2019.","We added the next phase of our mixed use Hub on Causeway development in Boston which is a 440 unit high rise residential building. We owned this in a joint venture with the Delaware North Company and our share of the project cost is $154 million. The project will deliver its first units in late 2019.","With these additions, our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential development and redevelopments comprising 6.2 million - 3.4 billion of development. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have 1.5 billion remaining to fund.","The commercial component of this portfolio 81% pre-leased up from 75% last quarter and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7% in total.","Further, we have committed to but have not yet commenced in our active pipeline 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and 1750 presidents for Leidos in Reston together representing 744,000 square feet and $520 million in investment. These projects are collectively 76% prerelease.","And lastly we have four different tenant negotiations underway in Cambridge, Boston, Washington DC and Reston to anchor four significant and largely pre-leased new office developments representing 2.5 million square feet of additional start in 2018 and 2019.","The pace of our new development activity has clearly accelerated over the past few quarters. This is solely due to our success in winning mandates with important customers, not due to our willingness to accept lower yields and higher levels of risk. All other projects we have recently launched and hope to start in the next few quarters our substantially pre-leased.","New development such as the Salesforce Tower will come into service over the next few quarters and dramatically increase our operating cash flow. As a result will be able to fund our new development pipeline using debt without materially increasing our leverage profile.","If however, we elect to seek equity to fund the portion of the pipelines it will be raised through the sale and\/or joint venture of select assets or development not through issuing equity at our current share price.","So to conclude, we are increasingly confident about achieving our clearly communicated plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets. And growth beyond 2020 is now becoming more clear and likely given all the developments we have added and expect to add to our pipeline.","I will turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks Owen, good morning everybody, happy new year. I want to pick up on Owen\u2019s economic commentary as it relates to office demand in our markets. As evidenced by their actions our primary customers which are larger real estate users, the public, the private, the start up and the established are exhibiting renewed confidence by making the decision to either upgrade and consolidate their space and in some cases expand.","As Owen suggested, as we begin 2018 we are as busy as we have ever been with new development investments on a pre-leased office portfolio. We also have three residential projects, Owen described the most recent and two of those are opening this year. In fact one of them is opened as we speak and we are taking leasing in Reston.","20 CityPoint was leased to an engineering firm 1750 in Reston Town Center is leased to Leidos a science engineering and technology government contractor, also called the defense contractor. They are currently in 170,000 square feet and two of our other buildings in Reston Town Center and is part of the consolidation they are taking 100% to 175,000 square feet of this new building.","While we continue to see the bulk of new incremental office demand from technology and life science businesses, here is also robust demand for new space but not necessarily growth from traditional industries.","For example, if you look at the leasing activity in Manhattan in 2017 the finance, insurance and the real estate sectors led the way. I think there are some articles recently about two banks that look like they were expanding and\/or consolidating in Midtown and there are a number of recent law firms announcements that will be coming to take new space in Midtown Manhattan.","One of the topics that we are being queried about recently, our expectations for market growth, rental growth in our markets. So the first thing you have to consider is that we have seen significant market rental growth over the last few years from the lease up and delivery of all of the new construction in our market.","New construction rents are higher in most cases than current rent. This is true in New York City, in Boston, in San Francisco and Washington DC. Now the impact on existing inventory which makes up the bulk of the availability in all the markets is not quite as simple to delineate.","But in general we would say that overall taking rent for existing space in 2018 are probably going to be pretty flat versus 2017. Now this excludes some of the exceptional sub markets like Cambridge or the leasing at newer buildings south of market in San Francisco. This will also come with rising tenant improvement contributions.","Now you have heard me say this before and it bears repeating, higher concessions of the product have two factors; one is increased supply; and the second is dramatically higher construction cost when building out tenant improvement. We increased our TI contribution as we completed the last round of deals at Salesforce Tower along with significantly increasing our rental rates and our annual escalations.","On the other hand, we have also had to increase our contribution in New York City as supply has become more of a factor. Now as you know the increasing market rent is a much less important determination of our revenue growth than the mark-to-market of our inspiring leases and changes in occupancy.","This quarter the mark-to-market on our leases that have an economic impact was pretty flat overall, but varied widely by market. In Boston, we were up about 6%, so 98% of the portfolio that hit the numbers this quarter was in our suburban assets.","In New York City, we were actually down just under 4%, but this was because of the big ticket relax that we had done at 399 Park Avenue and they are pretty close to the forecast that we have talked about over the last few years. The base of that building is going to be pretty flat, the high rise in the building is going to be up.","In DC we were down 6% due to a 22,000 square foot lease in our last suburban Montgomery County asset where rents have rolled out significantly. And in San Francisco we were up 62% on a small portfolio of about 50,000 square feet which was concentrated in our Mountain View single-storey product.","I\u2019m going to start my regional comment with Salesforce Tower in San Francisco and I suspect this is the last call where we\u2019ll have much to say about leasing activity there. During the quarter, we leased an additional 205,000 square feet including leases with a law firm, a private equity firm, an investment manager, and a co-working company.","As of today, we are 97% leased and the first tenants have moved into the building. Every lease we have signed, we are negotiating, and is scheduled to commence by the third quarter of 2019. The only new construction with remaining availability in the city of San Francisco today is Park Tower 750,000 square foot building which will likely be available in late 2018.","The next building to be delivered first in mission is probably 2022 or beyond. Large blocks of contiguous available space are going to be come in the form of sub-lets from tenants that are moving to the new construction or business failure.","This quarter, our 56,000 square foot tenant at 50 Hawthorne exited the market and they entered to an as is sub-let for their entire space with a nine year term remaining at a mid-80s starting rent. They were paying $64 gross with share in the Subway product.","As we move into 2018 our bay area activity is going to be centered around the 80,000 square foot block we are getting back from the one tenant the only tenant that is relocating from Embarcadero Center to Salesforce Tower and four available floors at EC4 though they are not contiguous. Along with a whole host of early renewals that are underway.","In the fourth quarter, we completed about 100,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center. As of Monday we have three offers on the block that we are getting back from 80,000 square feet and EC1, three offers on 80,000 square foot block. There will also be some rollover in Mountain View where we continue to be delighted by the strength of that market.","The bulk of our portfolio increase in our 2018 estimates outlined in the press release is a direct result of the strong leasing occupancy gains from the Boston region. In Boston we completed another 66,000 square feet of leasing at 200 Clarendon during the quarter bringing our total leasing to 350,000 square feet in 2017, and we currently have another 25,000 square feet that were done this quarter and we are negotiating a deal for our last currently vacant floor 30,000 square feet.","We completed our lease negotiations at the Hub on Causeway for 147,000 square feet of the 180,000 square feet of podium office space that build as Owen said is going to be opening in the third quarter of 2019.","And we have reached agreement with the retail users for 36,000 square feet which will get us 95% of the retail space committed and 89% of that total project. Demand for space in Boston from growing technology tenant is as strong as we have ever seen it. Hence our discussions with another tenant possibly for the Tower at the Hub on Causeway.","A year ago, I described the possible opportunity to recapture the Microsoft lease at 455 Main Street in Cambridge. This has in fact happened, we took it back on the 31st of December, we have signed a lease we have re-let 90,000 square feet of the 105,000 square feet block the roll up on the 90,000 square feet is the 122% on a net basis that will hit our statistics next quarter.","In our Waltham, Lexington suburban portfolio we completed 395,000 square feet this quarter including another 71,000 at our 191 Spring Street redevelopment that\u2019s now 88% leased and saw its first occupancy earlier this month.","Last quarter we foreshadowed starting a new building and when said we hit the goal of 20 CityPoint. And we have active interest for the remainder of that building. As we said at our investor conference the most significant opportunity for high contribution occupancy improvement is in our New York City portfolio.","At 399 Park we are in active discussions with a tenant that could take the entire low-rise block 250,000 square feet and we have an active pipeline of tenants of between 65,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet for the low-rise space if that field doesn't happen and a number of tenants for a high-rise floors. In fact we have in excess of 700,000 square feet of proposals outstanding at that building.","At 159 East 53rd Street discussions or even further along with a tenant that will take the entire 195,000 square foot block. Tier 2, activity is significantly higher than it was at the end of the third quarter and we have multiple proposals outstanding. These deals are in line with our original rental assumption of mid to high 80s starting rents in the low rise but our tenant improvement contribution will be higher than what our expectations were two years ago.","At the top of 399, we have a full floor lease under negotiation where rents are in the $120 a square foot area. Given the condition of the space and the build out requirements future executed leases for these building will not run through our 2018 numbers, but they will be part of 2019.","We completed a lot of leasing during the fourth quarter in New York City, 622,000 square feet and it was centered around long-term renewals. I previously mentioned in the previous quarter the early lease extensions that we were working on with Ann Taylor at Time Square Tower for their 2020 expirations.","While we have also completed a 70,000 square foot law firm renewal at Time Square Tower, a 90,000 square foot law firm expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue and on 767 Fifth General Motors building, one of our anchor tenants has exercised an expansion rate and will be adding the 77,000 square foot of swing space that we recaptured last year.","If you remember that termination income we discussed, as part of these premises, when it renews and extends in 2022 and we have another anchor tenant that expanded by 39,000 square feet. Big quarter in New York on the renewal and extension perspective.","Finally, our view on the high end in New York which is defined as over a $100 a square foot, in 2017 is as follows. There were a lot of deals done over $100 a square foot. The most since 2008 based on total square footage.","Seven of the top 10 were new construction which tells you tenants will pay a premium for new product and on the other hand there is more competition for existing high end space. As we look into 2018 the new buildings on the west side with space price over $100 are significantly leased. And the next step is not going to come online until 2021 and beyond. We expect that deals completed during 2018 at over $100 a square foot are going to drift back to the existing product or the new product on the east side which has a much higher price point.","Finally, DC. Last quarter, I broke our DC activities into three themes. The pattern holds true for the fourth quarter. First, matching space and tenants together to launch new development. Last quarter with Marriott and TSA, this quarter it\u2019s 2100, Penn and 1750 in Reston.","The second theme is the strength of Reston Town Center as a magnet for private sector contractors and technology tenants. This quarter we completed seven transactions for 205,000 square feet of office leasing and are working on more than 300,000 square feet of additional deals at our existing Town Center properties predominantly future of lease expirations.","And finally, the CBD Class A market remains highly competitive with more availability coming online. The good news is that we don\u2019t have a lot of space. The challenge is that there are lots and lots of options for smaller tenants.","I will stop there and let Mike to continue on.","Michael LaBelle","Thank you, Doug. Good morning. I\u2019m going to start by describing our activity in the bond market last quarter. We actively monitor the market and we saw window late in the quarter where the bond market was feeling very strong combined with a relatively stable rate environment. This was an opportunity for us to take some financing risk off the table, lock in future interest savings and refinance our 2018 debt maturities.","So in December we elected to redeem $850 million of unsecured bonds that carried a 3.85% all-in interest rate and they were scheduled to mature in November of 2018. We funded the redemption with a new seven year deal, also $850 million with an all-in yield 3.35%.","We recorded a charge on the early redemption of $13.9 million or $0.08 per share that was not included in our prior earnings guidance. We also locked in approximately 50 basis points of interest savings or about $0.03 per share through 2018. Given the recent sell off in treasury it looks like a good decision today, but we will have to wait until late 2018 to know for sure.","Turning to our earnings, our fourth quarter funds from operations came in at $1.49 per share excluding the impact of our debt redemption. Our FFO exceeded our guidance from last quarter by about $7 million or $0.04 per share. The majority of the increase came from higher than projected NOI from the portfolio that beat our budget by about $5 million.","Largest contributors were expansion by existing tenants in New York City and in Boston that occurred earlier than anticipated. And about half the improvement was due to operating expenses coming in lower than our budget. Lastly we recorded approximately $2 million of higher than projected fee income across the portfolio.","Overall 2017 was a solid year for us. We increased our dividend 7%, we grew our FFO per share by over 3%, and we grew our share of same property NOI by 2.6% despite dealing with a significant amount of lease roll over New York City.","We also delivered developments that added approximately $17 million of incremental NOI and we are positioned to add substantially more going forward. And we completed $6 billion of debt transactions extending our maturities and reducing our overall borrowing cost by over 50 basis points.","Looking at 2018 the major changes to our earnings projections come from asset sales, interest expense, and portfolio leasing assumptions. As Owen mentioned we sold 500 East Street in Washington DC during the first week of January. 500 East Street was built in the 1980s and it was one of the first buildings we developed in Washington.","We had recently extended anchor GSA lease with a long-term flat extension for the property had minimal NOI growth going forward. The sale is not included in our prior projections and reduces our projected 2018 FFO by approximately $0.05 per share.","In the portfolio as Doug described we have strong activity on some of our Bacon space particularly in Boston, New York City and San Francisco. In Boston we have now leased Bay Colony to over 90%.","We project 200 Clarendon Street to reach 98% leased this year and we just signed a 90,000 square feet lease Doug mentioned to backfill the state vacated by Microsoft in Cambridge at a big roll up and rent. In New York City we project 250 West 55th Street to reach near a 100% occupancy this year in fact selling all of the states we got to back from Al Jazeera\u2019s termination.","As Doug mentioned we have good leasing activity at 399 Park Avenue, but we don't expect any meaningful impact to our 2018 earnings due to the timing of occupancy. And in San Francisco we are seeing a steady stream of activity and expect to continue to gain occupancy as we fill the small vacancies complete renewals and work on back filling of the banes base that comes back to us in early 2018.","Overall we are keeping our guidance for 2018 same property NOI growth steady. It\u2019s a little ironic that the improvement in our fourth quarter 2017 run rate mutes the impact of the improvement in our 2018 leasing assumptions.","We still assume growth in our share of same property NOI for 2018 over 2017 to be within a range of 0.5% to 2.5%, but from a higher starting point. However, we are increasing our guidance for straight-line rents by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $55 million to $75 million and we project our occupancy will improve throughout 2018, approaching 92% by year-end of the.","Our guidance for the incremental contribution to 2018 NOI from our development is unchanged at $40 million to $50 million. We plan to deliver two residential projects in the first half of 2018, one in Cambridge and one in Reston, but their NOI contribution for the year is projected to be nominal during the lease up period and is expected to pick up in 2019. The","The two largest contributors to 2018 NOI are 888 Boylston Street which is now 93% leased, and Salesforce Tower which just commenced occupancy at the end of 2017. Salesforce Tower now 97% leased is projected to generate less than 20% of its full run rate in 2018. We project it to generate its full contribution upon stabilization in the third quarter of 2019.","Our net interest expense assumptions have changed as a result of our refinancing activity and the increase in development with the addition of 20 CityPoint, the Hub on Causeway Residential and 1750 President Street to the pipeline.","We project net interest expense for 2018 to be between $350 million and $380 million which is about $7 million less than our prior expectation. After accounting for the reduction in earnings from asset sales we are increasing our guidance at the midpoint by $0.07 per share for FFO.","The changes from our prior guidance includes the loss of $0.05 per share from asset sales, improvement in the NOI contribution from the portfolio of $0.03 per share and lower interest expense of $0.04 per share. Our guidance range for 2018 FFO is $6.23 to $6.36 per share.","As both Doug and Owen described, the most significant growth driver for us going forward is from delivering our existing developments and adding new developments to the pipeline. This quarter we succeeded in both of these areas by increasing the pipeline to 81% pre-leased for commercial space adding two new projects to the pipeline and advancing several of our other opportunities through the predevelopment phase. These activities build on the already strong growth we project over the next few years.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Owen in your opening remarks you talked about the increase in development that you are seeing driven a lot by the tenants and build-to-suit opportunities that you are not aggressively going out and seeking additional risk. And I\u2019m just curious if you flip the coin over and you think the amount of tenants that are seeking new space either in existing development that have come out of the ground or in these built-to-suit opportunities, how does that position the existing stock of office buildings in you core markets that may need substantial CapEx to keep them relevant for tenants?","I know you have certainly spent a lot of capital last couple of years in your buildings, but how do you sort of think about the trajectory going forward of that existing stock and are you more likely to try to buy some of these buildings and put the CapEx in and use your skill set or are you more likely to look at your portfolio and sell into it and sell off that capital need?","Owen Thomas","Well I think Michael that if you go through the development activity that we are doing, it\u2019s a combination of factors that our customers are seeking new space. I mean obviously some of it is relocation, some of its consolidation from multiple locations and some of it is actual growth. So it\u2019s not all zero sum. So it\u2019s baked out at the offset.","And then second as it relates to our existing portfolio, we clearly spend a lot of time assessing each of our buildings and keeping a close watch on those buildings that we think are the most competitive and the least competitive.","And as we went through on our investor conference last year, we selected quite a few of our existing assets and we have embarked upon pretty significant refreshment projects, not sure I will go through all those on this call right now, but whether be it 53rd in the Lex, what we have done in the suburbs of Boston, there have been a number of assets that we think are long-term viable and interesting to customers.","I mean Doug talked about the work we are doing at 53rd in Lex and the leasing activity that we are seeing at 399 and 159 is very, very active. So yes we are making those investments on assets that we think are long-term competitive, we are seeing good results from that.","And then lastly we have been selectively taking assets that we don't think are going to be as competitive for the long-term and we have been pruning them.","This has been a smaller activity over the last few years, but I think we fairly consistently sold between $100 million and $300 million of assets over the last two or three years.","Doug Linde","So Michael, if you look at the four markets that we are in, in the significant way and we hopefully will be significantly in Los Angeles at some point in the near future.","The Boston market has primarily driven by tenants coming into the market from outside of the market so there has been very \u201clittle\u201d sort of musical chair that\u2019s going on which has just driven the majority of the new construction, a lot of it is from the suburb.","I mean San Francisco as you are aware, the vast majority of the new construction has been taken up by growing technology tenants and so again there has been very little inventory that\u2019s been leftover.","In Washington DC there is a problem, Owen and I have referred to it as the muffin top issue which is there are a lot of people who are building new buildings and they are leasing the tops of these building for law firms and they are struggling and struggle with the rest of their phase and then that is a much more of musical chairs market.","And then you are well aware some of your conversations with other public REITs about the issues associated with the supply in Manhattan and the issues that those buildings that are not recapitalizing themselves are going to have a real issues and there is going to be a significant demarcation in the availability of space in those buildings versus new constructions and building that have made the leaper phase and put new capital in.","1271 is a best example of a really tired building that said they get the bullet and they put $300 million of new capital in literally redoing the [indiscernible] systems in addition to lobby and they are being very successful leasing space. So I think you are seeing what is actually going on in real time in these various markets.","Michael Bilerman","Manny had a question too.","Manny Korchman","Hey guys. Doug if you could help clarify on Leidos just to understand correctly, how much space are they coming out of in your existing assets and when is that going to happen?","Doug Linde","So they are coming out of 170,000 square feet, they are in two separate buildings. One of the problems just in their own prediction in Reston is that they were not all consolidated in one building and then they also did a major acquisition. And so they are going into 275,000 square feet and it will happen in probably the second quarter of 2020.","Manny Korchman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Hey guys congratulations on a busy leasing quarter. You talked about the renewed confidence from tenants and obviously reported a lot of activity past quarter. I mean would you describe there it as being a really a noticeable shift in tenant activity just in this last quarter from Tax Reform changes and other maybe sort of optimism from other areas? And then based on what you are seeing on the ground do you believe that net absorption of rent growth could accelerate in your markets in the next year or two?","Owen Thomas","I think Jim, maybe I will take the first part and Doug can take the second part. I think it\u2019s a combination of factors, I don\u2019t think a switch got slipped when Tax Reform came out and all of a sudden you know the leasing activity went up. But I do think it\u2019s a positive boost, companies that pay taxes being more profitable and therefore more willing to invest. I think that is clearly a plus.","I think the one thing that also is shifting is the breadth of the leasing activity. We have talked for quarter-after-quarter about the importance of technology and life sciences and that clearly still is growing and is important, but we are also announcing growth and net absorption activity from financials, even law firms are moving-in in some cases taking more space. I think the breadth of the demand has also been very helpful.","Doug Linde","And regarding where we think rental rates are going to go, again the challenge in these markets is that it\u2019s a supply problem not a demand problem. And so, to the extent that there is continued supply, I think you are going to see pressure on the economics of the existing inventory. I don\u2019t think you are going to see pressure on the economics of the new supply.","And what is going on is that there is a big premium associated with the new supply relative to where tenants are moving out. And the confidence is what I think is driving them to be in a position where they are prepared to make those decisions.","So the best example in our portfolio most recently has been that this firm that they took the space at 20 CityPoint. I mean that\u2019s firm an engineering company that was located in the market. They were in a tertiary building, a not traditional high quality office building.","And based upon their business and quite frankly overall employment trends in these marketplaces and the desire and the needs to recruit and retain power, they said it\u2019s time for us to step it up and go into a different kind of a facility. And so they are paying significantly different kind of a rent than they were paying in their previous premises.","And I think that story is going on, and on, and on in all of this new construction that\u2019s occurring across our markets predominantly with these traditionally tenants. We are not necessarily looking at this as simply a growth opportunity, but really a change in the way they are managing their businesses from a real estate facilities perspective.","Jed Reagan","So you don\u2019t see the growth and concession that you referred to, you don\u2019t see that abating anytime soon either?","Doug Linde","I don\u2019t, I think that as part of the new construction and the higher rent, the market has been conditioned to a higher concession level and I think that\u2019s across the board, across the country. I mean even on the last couple of spaces we have a Salesforce Tower, I mean I think we literally have 30,000 square feet, we are still prepared to give a $100 a square foot on a 10 to 15 year deal.","But the rent has gone up a lot, I mean the rent when we originally performed at the top of that building was in high 60s to low 70s and then high 80s to low 90s now. And the [indiscernible] increase was 2% to 2.5% and now it\u2019s 3% plus. So we\u2019re getting paid for it.","Jed Reagan","Thanks, and then separately one other question. A few of your peers have been buying back stock recently and just curious to get your latest thought on that strategy for BXP versus development and may be other uses of capital?","Owen Thomas","We think development is more accretive for shareholders. As I mentioned, we are launching these projects, our existing development portfolio is generating about a 7% cash yield. And depending on how you look at it, we think our stock is trading in the low-5s on cap rate basis. So we clearly think it trades at discount to NAV but they yield is very different from where the dollars are that we are investing in development.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Thank you. Turning a little bit, you guys have been pretty active in the multifamily development business a very different business for you, low on releasing cost, low on CapEx on the second generation. How much do you like that business going forward and do you think that\u2019s going to become a more important integral part of your business?","Michael LaBelle","John we like it. We started in the business as you know by developing on a mix used sites where we would acquire the site and\/or entitle the site and it would have a multifamily component and I think in the far past history of Boston Properties these sites were generally sold. But we started developing them ourselves. We were successful. We have made money on it, not just on paper we sold the Avenue in Washington DC for a very significant profits for Boston Property\u2019s shareholders.","So I think we demonstrated the ability to do it and as we run across and we come across sites most of the time they are going to be in some way associated with our office development, but not always. And if it is a site that we believe and we think we can generate the kinds of yields that we have been talking about we are going to continue to grow it.","John Guinee","And then a question for you Doug, Boston I think you talked by immigration which is helping grow demand if I have got that right. What industries are coming to Boston and from where are they coming?","Doug Linde","So for the most part it\u2019s both the what I referred was life science companies and they are coming from out of state as well as the suburbs. And then there are some technology companies and they are coming predominantly from the suburban locations. And those are locations in the greater 128 area. So Lexington and Waltham and [indiscernible] and places like that.","But interestingly, there are other growing tenants in those same submarkets they are grabbing the space that\u2019s coming available. So there is incremental net organic demand and new business activity in the suburb of Boston, the deal where you were starting that is absorbing the state as these other tenants are moving into the city.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Hi guys. Owen maybe just going back to your commentary about the ability to fund new development with data at this point not really impact leverage. I'm just curious at this point in the cycle maybe what is the high end of your towers range on debt-to-EBITDA versus looking to accelerate asset sales or [indiscernible] at the joint ventures?","Michael LaBelle","I will answer that Craig just so can an answer something. So right now our debt-to-EBITDA is in the mid-6s and our [indiscernible] are desired targeted range, its somewhere plus or minus seven, based upon the delivery of the development that we have going on and when the NOI comes on its going to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA to six times or even maybe below six times.","So as we look out at this development that we have planned plus adding some more that might happen. We feel very comfortable that we can stay below seven the entire time. There may be blips like for example in the first quarter of 2018 we are likely to blip above seven, because we are not going get any income from Salesforce Tower and all the money is going to be out.","But then it\u2019s going to come right back down through 2018. So we think that we have the ability to use debt to fund the foreseeable pipeline that we have without needing to raise any equity.","Craig Mailman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Doug your commentary on kind of where higher price deals in New York could go. Just curious, do you think there could be enough activity coming back to the east side to kind of change the narrative about the center of Manhattan shifting west.","Doug Linde","I\u2019m going to be honest with you, I think it\u2019s already happening. There were two institutions on the financial side, two banks that took additional space and what I refer to a traditional midtown not the far west side. And there are three or four major other transactions that we expect will happen in the first quarter. And people will say \u201cjeez I guess the east side hasn\u2019t quite lost its cluster.\u201d","I mean quite frankly the fact of the matter is that there is no real estates in the Hudson Yard any longer, it\u2019s all new construction. The next building are coming online, until 2022 plus there is available space downtown in the buildings that are currently under construction or recently completed. And I think people are feeling really good still about midtown Manhattan and there is significant amount of traditional tenancy that still values the grand central station and the east side amenity.","And so we are pretty confident and again the amount of activity that we have seen in the last quarter or so at 399 now that we are showing a finished product predominantly and 159 where the skin is on and people can walk around and they can feel what we are doing and they are seeing what the likely common areas are going to look like. We are getting a great reaction and people are encouraged and a lot of this is growth.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Robert Simone","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Owen in your opening remarks and then Doug later on, both made reference to obviously smartly expanding your presence in LA. And Doug you used the term near future. I was just wondering if you guys could elaborate on that. Is there anything specific that you are working on? And then I have a quick follow-up if there is time.","Owen Thomas","Yes, we are always working on new business in LA. Jon Lange is on the phone as well and we are thrilled to have Jon in the Company, he has really helped us to have some boots on the ground and highs in years on the ground. So we have ambition, but I have said many times we are going to do it in a profitable manner.","We are not going to grow for the sake of growth. We have we think a nice profit in the Colorado Center acquisition and we are going to similarly seek to make profitable investments in LA. We are looking at some development things. We are looking at some existing acquisitions. It\u2019s not an easy time to do this.","I talked about a deal that\u2019s sold in El Segundo for a mid to high-4s cap rate and nearly $600 a square foot. So it\u2019s not an easy time to buy existing products, but we are hopeful through development and perhaps repositioning that we will continue to grow in LA.","Robert Simone","Great, thanks Owen. And then on the follow-up for just kind of shifting a little bit to 399 Park. This might be kind of hard question to answer. But in your guy\u2019s internal planning, what probability do you guys or what timing do you guys describe to either all or more likely some subset of the proposal that are currently changing hands. And if those leases hit your targets, when should investors think about cash NOI or cash rents starting to hit your P&L?","Owen Thomas","The third or fourth quarter of 2019 for when the cash is going to hit the majority of it, and then our full run rate basis obviously 2020, right, so because you are going to get part partial year. And we feel really good about our prospect. I don\u2019t like to sort of give a probability number out there, but we are in lease discussions, actively lease discussions which means that we have letters of intent that are being pushed back and forth multiple times.","We have lots of interest in the building, there are literally more than two or three tours a week on the low rise of that space and we could have lightning in a bottle and have a hand shake with somebody in two days or it could take us to two months. I just can't give a good approximation on that.","Jon Lange","Yes, this is Jon. The building is looking really good now, the side work is about 80% done, the storefronts done, we are going to finish off the entrance in the next month or two, the city is out, we demolished some of the floors so there is a reason why it's all happening now.","Robert Simone","Got it. Thanks guys.","Owen Thomas","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank. I'm just hoping to get your latest thoughts on consolidation and just space per employee where do you think we are in that part of the cycle as you are seeing REIT leasing pickup in your market?","Doug Linde","This is going to sound like a little bit of cant answer. It depends on the industry group. We continue to see on a marginal basis major law firms who haven't had a lease that was \u201cstruck\u201d in the last decade, continue to reduce their square footage, I mean the lease that we signed in 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue is a significant reduction in the overall footprint of the tenants that\u2019s moving into that building. So those things are going to continue to occur.","On the technology and the life science side, I would say that the densities have gotten about as low as they are going to get. People are starting to sort of push back on that. We have described sort of the issues that there our major tenants in San Francisco salesforce.com thinks about in terms of how they are building out their space.","They are exceedingly focused on collaboration areas which means that there are more areas that are devoted to gathering and left the areas that we devoted to \u201ceither\u201d a desktop or on office or tabletop. So we don\u2019t think there is much in the way of compression that is going to be going on in those locations.","And then businesses are expanding, they are hiring new people, you look at the unemployment rates across our major markets and you see a dearth of available labor and so people are clearly grabbing every employee that\u2019s around. And so that means that they expanding which means that they are taking additional space.","Jamie Feldman","Okay if I could just ask a follow-up on the comment you just made in terms of its just hard to find people. When we read about where that\u2019s the biggest challenge it does seem to be in your markets. Can you just talk about your thoughts on long-term job growth in kind of your coastal markets and I think that might impact.","Owen Thomas","Yes, I will give it a shot. Well this is crystal ball time. I'm not sure how valuable this will be. Look, this is related to economic growth, the job creation is going to be related to GDP growth and there are lots of experts out there that predict whenever sessions going to occur I'm not sure we are exactly able to do that.","I did provide some data at the Investor Conference last year that showed we are long in this cycle from a timing standpoint, but we are not long in this cycle from a net job creation standpoint. And then also I talked in my remarks about the Tax Reform and what impact that will have on the economy.","So Jamie I wish I could be more specific with you, I don\u2019t think we know exactly when the next recession is going to occur. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s near-term and I think job creation will follow that. And in the markets that are in we believe magnets for employment.","So when younger people, graduate from a university there with a PhD or a masters or a BA they are going to markets where there are the most opportunities for jobs and job growth, and those happen to be the markets that we are in and the universities are trying to make sure that they are providing the right skill sets for these types of workers.","I mean clearly I\u2019m surprised no one has asked about it, but I will bring it up. I mean Amazon is saying that they are going to go to a new city and hire 50,000 people over a 10 year period of time. That\u2019s a lot of people.","And when you have a 2% or 2.5% or 3% unemployment rate, you wonder where those people are going to come form and presumably they are going to come from certain companies that are no longer viable, that are going to have an exit. And then migration from other parts of the country into those markets where the jobs are most plentiful. And that\u2019s I think we\u2019re seeing happening in the markets like San Francisco.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. I appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS.","Nicholas Yulico","Hi, thanks. I was just hoping to get an update on the NOI bridge, how far along are you now on a leased percentage and where might you end 2018?","Owen Thomas","So this is like a torture question, right. I purposely didn\u2019t bring up to that word because I was hoping that we would never have to talk about it again. So big picture if you really care. So the numbers are $155 million, there is $86 million that\u2019s signed, there is $10 million that\u2019s pretty close, the incremental contribution from 399 is between $40 million and $45 million.","The rest of it\u2019s from EC, Gateway, General Motors building and Colorado Center and that gets you to a $155 million. And all of it is going to show up in our same-store result and our occupancy and that\u2019s hopefully the way we\u2019re going to sort of address it on a going forward basis.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. So you are not going to give where you are on the leased percentage right now?","Owen Thomas","I can\u2019t tell you on a square footage basis because we never sort of think about that way, we think about it on a revenue basis. I mean you can ask me the question every quarter and if I have the numbers and I\u2019m happy to give them to you, but we are moving into sort of saying okay we have given you an 2018 number we have given you a 2019 number. We told you when all this stuff is going to come online. And you will know when we do a lease at 399 because we\u2019ll tell you I promise. And that will be the biggest contribution to getting us really close to the ultimate objective.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, alright. Fair enough. Just one another question. Mike going back to the guidance, you mentioned $5 million of higher straight line rents. Wanted to be clear, is that just free rent related to leases already signed and then what is the potential for seeing additional straight line rent benefit in 2018 if you get more leasing done. Based on our vacancies, is there any space that could be delivered to a tenant this year and commence free rent?","Michael LaBelle","I think that\u2019s how we get to the high end of the guidance range. There certainly is projections that we have of things that hopefully will happen, where we will sign leases for either its starting phase or vacant space and we will get started and we will have a free rent period. Certainly the increase in the guidance is associated with leasing activity that we have or believe we are definitely going to get that has free rent period. So the vast majority of all of the straight line, is free rent.","Owen Thomas","And I guess I want to make one other point about free rent. So there are different kinds of free rent. There is free rent which is a conception to a tenant where once they start their actual occupancy in the space that they have a period of time when they are not paying. And that\u2019s Washington DC free rent.","Free rent in New York City and free rent in the Boston market are we sign a lease, we deliver the space, the tenant is building out the space over a period of time and during that period of time we are recognizing revenue because of the condition of the space. So there is a subtlety there that\u2019s important to understand.","Nicholas Yulico","That\u2019s helpful, I guess it is on 399 Park, is there any other space that would fit that potential to get if you got more lease signings done, it had more free rent this year?","Doug Linde","I think I talked about that before and it\u2019s a good point just to bring up which is the fact that we won't have that at 399 because of the condition of the space. So Jon described that we're getting a really great look and the reason we are getting a great look from the tenants is because we are demolishing the space and when you demolish a space whereby it\u2019s really not \u201cready\u201d for its intended use.","I'm kind of jogging here. You can't straight line it. You basically have to wait unit this space is actually delivered which means interestingly we are at the win to the extent that tenant is delayed and they are building out the space in order when we can recognize that revenue even though we may actually have rent commitment.","Which again is the situation we have on our new construction in San Francisco, where we are actually receiving cash rents from salesforce.com on a lot of their space that we are not recognizing revenue because the space isn\u2019t build out yet.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Thank you Doug.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi good morning. Just two quick questions. First, for Michael about on the dispositions that you guys talked about which includes the one that already closed in DC the 200 million of 300 million. Does that mean there is roughly sort of another $0.05 of loss on annualized basis that\u2019s not in guidance or is there some sort of adjustment already reflected in guidance for what Owen outlined?","Michael LaBelle","I mean we don\u2019t have anything else in our guidance for assumed sales. And we haven\u2019t determine what assets they are, some of them might be land, and we do have some excess land that we already have kind of under agreement where it might be being re-entitled or some other things might be happening that we expect to close this year. So that would have almost no impact on our FFO other than the carrying cost of insurance and taxes which is nominal.","And there might be a couple of non-core suburban type of assets as well that might have a moderate impact. But at this point we haven't identified and we are still working on kind of determining what assets those might be. So it\u2019s too early to kind of say what the impact might be.","Owen Thomas","We do get cash money for those sales you know.","Alexander Goldfarb","I know that. the second question. As we heard this morning cash flow is good. Just second question is Owen you mentioned that year end you expect to get to 92, it sounds like if you got all the city space backfill that\u2019s another 100 basis points that gets you to 93\u2026","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from [indiscernible].","Owen Thomas","What is going on. I'm sorry operator we still have the question going on.","Owen Thomas","Alex, if you want to start over on the question?","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes, can you hear me?","Owen Thomas","Yes, we got you.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, great. So on the occupancy side, Owen, I think you said you expect to get to year end 92% if you backfill City that gets you another 100 basis points next year to 93%. Do you think that you guys could get towards 95% or there are structural things about the portfolio meaning tenants always moving in moving out that probably like that 93-ish may be sort of your max versus getting closer to 95% given all the demand in the market right now?","Owen Thomas","I think that we should be able to get to 94% to 95% on a run rate basis and most of that is the availability we have in Manhattan. So that you add a 200,000 square feet we have at 159 and you add 500,000 plus square feet we have at 399 which should be leased on a long-term basis. But overall, expiration schedule that we are looking at for - and I showed you just when we did our Investor Conference, so if you look at those slides you can see it, for 2019 through 2020 it\u2019s pretty light. So we should get there by the end of next year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey. Good morning, Owen. Just going back to development conversation, obviously a lot of success on leasing there, adding few more projects. But I was just curious and we\u2019re hearing a lot about labor shortages as well as rising construction costs, I haven\u2019t heard you guys really change your development yield expectations recently. So I\u2019m just curious I guess the implications that rent growth is keeping up with construction, but curious if you can comment on what kind of construction cost increases you have seen over the past year and then also what you are seeing from just availability of labor on the construction side?","Owen Thomas","So I think I made a comment earlier on one of the reasons the tenant improvements are going up is because it\u2019s just costing a lot more to build out space, which is I think a statement that we see significant inflation in the construction industry. When we do our base buildings, when we are making a bid on a project, sometimes we are actually bid it on the formula basis, so the tenants paying a percentage of a factor on what the actual costs are, so it sort of moves.","But in most cases, when we bid a building and we provide a rent to somebody, what we have done is we have built in cost escalation into our construction component in our development budget. And over the last call it three or four years, we have been building in anywhere 3% and 6% depending upon the marketplace on annual basis for that component of the project cost.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then in terms of just overall availability, are you running into issues finding enough labor?","Owen Thomas","Yes so honestly that\u2019s the reason for the escalation for the most part is labor shortages. And so you have contractors who are working with subcontractors who are bidding to lose in fact we are saying well we will do the job by. And I think one of the advantages that Boston Properties has is that we are a perpetual user of labor in our markets with our contractors and with our subcontractors, and we have an impeccable reputation with regards to making payments on time, treating our subcontractors well, dealing with changed orders appropriately.","And because of that I don\u2019t want to say we get preferential pricing, but we certainly get preferential access to the subs who want to do work and know that if they do work with us in a good market they are also going to be able to do work with us in a bad market. So we have not had a procurement problem on any of our jobs.","Vincent Chao","Okay, got it. And then I know you guys have been pretty clear that you are not going to use equity to fund any of the development needs here, but just curious in 2018 I know the development pipeline shows 1.4 billion of remaining funding needs but that obviously goes up with some of these projects that you have recently added or will be added shortly. Curious what the total CapEx budget is for 2018, how much do you actually think you will spend in 2018?","Michael LaBelle","So this is capital on the existing portfolio as oppose to development spend?","Vincent Chao","No, no development spend specifically.","Michael LaBelle","2018 something around $800.","Vincent Chao","800 million. Okay and then just maybe one last one. Owen you mentioned you are not concerned about a material increase in rates in 2018. But I guess what you consider material increase? I mean I guess is 3% still within that limit or how much - can you provide some color on that?","Owen Thomas","Yes. Predicting rates is obviously parallel, but I think material would be something significantly over 3%.","Vincent Chao","Significantly over 3%. Okay, thank you.","Owen Thomas","That\u2019s where I would say it would be material.","Vincent Chao","Right.","Arista Joyner","Okay, thank you for your time and attention and interest in Boston Properties. That concludes the call.","Michael LaBelle","Thanks everyone.","Owen Thomas","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3424":["Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 29, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arista Joyner - Investor Relations Manager","Mortimer B.

Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties' Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. This is Mort Zuckerman speaking. As you all probably know and as you read in all the newspapers, there is a general sense that our economy is still moving forward but at a slower-than-expected pace. What is interesting for Boston Properties frankly is that we still seem to be quite active, perhaps not to the same extent with large tenants, but certainly the combination of large tenants and small tenants is very encouraging to our basic strategy of having the best buildings in the best locations in the best markets. And that strategy, I think, has helped us, I think, do relatively -- and perform relatively well in the atmosphere of what a couple of firms have called the Great Recession because we had a very subpar period, a very long period of subpar economic growth in macroeconomic terms.","And yet in the markets that we are in and in the locations that we are in, in those markets, we still continue to have a lot of activity. And I think this is going to continue from all that we can tell in terms of our interaction with the various tenants in the various markets we are in. Nobody can quite predict what the overall economy can do because we are 4 or 5 years into an attempt on the part of both fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate a stronger rate of growth than we are experiencing now. And in particular, we are seeing, according to various surveys, one of which was just published this past week in the Financial Times, that American business is constraining its capital spending on plant and equipment to a fairly low level going forward. Now nobody knows how accurate these assessments will be, because a lot depends on whether or not there is a perception of a stronger growth in the economy. And if that happens, I think we'll see an even more active investment policy on the part of a lot of American business.","But in the buildings that we are in and in the markets that we are in, we continue to see an encouraging amount of activity and we are comfortable that we're going to continue to see this going forward. We have relatively little vacancy in our existing buildings. We have a number of additional building projects that we will describe. And in particular, I urge you to listen to the folks from our Boston office talk about some of the projects that we're doing there. We had a review of one of them this past day or 2, and it's really going to be an extraordinary project and one of the best projects in the history of Boston, much less in the history of Boston Properties.","So with that, if I may, I'll turn it over to my colleagues, who will fill in and expand on where we are in our various markets. And I thank you for your attention.","Owen D. Thomas","Thank you, Mort. This is Owen Thomas. Good morning, everyone. I'm joined here in Boston by Doug and Mike, as well as our team here. I'll touch on our overall performance for the quarter, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss some organizational changes that we made as a company last quarter. Doug will then discuss our markets and operational performance, and Mike will provide some more color on our financial results for the fourth quarter.","Just quickly, building a bit on Mort's comments, despite the economic weakness overall that Mort described, our market exposure to technology companies, to health care and small-scale financials has continued to serve us well. And we continue to experience very favorable market conditions in a number of our core markets, including San Francisco, Cambridge, suburban Boston and to some degree, Midtown Manhattan.","Switching to performance. In the fourth quarter, I believe we performed well overall. Three things I would highlight. First and specifically, we executed 97 leases representing 1.3 million square feet, with reasonable balance across our portfolio nationally. However, San Francisco and Boston were the largest contributors. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are now 93.4% leased, and that's up 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and up 200 basis points for calendar year 2013.","Second, on the leasing side, we also continue to make significant progress leasing our development pipeline. And as Mort touched on and Doug is going to describe in greater detail, we've made some substantial and exciting progress on a number of new developments, which again we're going to talk about further later in the call. And then lastly and you're going to hear more about this as well, we were able to complete in the last quarter several planned asset sales that were part of our strategy and plan.","Now second, turning to capital strategy. Interest rate increases, as all of you know, have been fairly benign over the past quarter. It's likely -- it's our belief that it's likely that interest rates will continue to rise, but the timing and the pace of such increases are obviously difficult to forecast. We're finding private capital for real estate remains plentiful and continues to aggressively pursue real estate investments, particularly for high-quality office in our core markets.","Our capital strategy remains consistent with what we've communicated to you in the past. And specifically, number one, we continue to actively monetize assets and, in fact, sold 2 suburban assets in the fourth quarter. For 2013 in the aggregate, we sold 7 assets, raising $1.25 billion in proceeds, which created a $2.25 per share special dividend, which we announced at the end of last year. You should expect our selected monetization activity to continue. Second, we have and will continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But we continue to find that either our underwriting assumptions and\/or our return requirements are not aligned with the pricing being offered by others for high-quality office assets in our focus markets. And therefore, we have been less active making acquisitions over the last few quarters. And then third, we continue to see interesting opportunities in development, where we believe we can deliver new properties at lower cost per square foot and higher yields than where existing older properties are trading. Our development pipeline remains robust, as you know, with $2.5 billion in active projects plus a number of additional high-quality developments under consideration.","Then lastly, I want to touch on a few organizational changes. As you know, our New York Regional Manager, Robert Selsam, retired after 33 years with Boston Properties at the end of 2013. We engaged last year in a search to find Robert's replacement. And we are absolutely delighted to have hired John Powers, who commenced his duties at the beginning of the year. John is a 27-year veteran of CBRE and has been a key advisor to Mort, Doug and Boston Properties in the New York market for over 15 years. Given that John is well-known within Boston Properties and has extensive knowledge of the company, particularly in New York, the transition has been seamless and he's been able to get off to a great start overall.","Lastly, on the organizational side, this past quarter, we announced that we will merge our Princeton operation into the New York region under John. We think this makes more organizational sense for us going forward because Princeton is not of the same scale as the other regions of Boston Properties and all of the regions of our company, except New York, have both a CBD and a suburban component. Boston Properties is now organized into 4 significant regions: New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.","Before turning it over to Doug, I wanted to ask John if he would join the call, introduce himself, and perhaps make a few comments.","John Francis Powers","Thanks very much, Owen. Yes, I've worked with Mort, Doug and all the people here in New York for many years, numerous transactions, 3 major developments and millions of square feet. So my ramp-up has been very quick and I'm now fully engaged with every aspect of our operations in New York and Princeton. I'm very excited to be here. Thank you.","Owen D. Thomas","Terrific, excited to have you, John. Over to Doug.","Douglas T. Linde","Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with a couple of comments on our divestitures because I just sort of want to give you a context of sort of how we're thinking about things.","So our asset sales fall into 2 buckets. The first of those assets that are located in sub [ph] markets, where our expectations of achieving long-term cash flow growth are really suboptimal, relative to the rest of the portfolio. And in 2013, I would characterize those as the sales of 303 Almaden, which is the building in San Jose; our 2 Mall Road assets, which are legacy Boston Properties pre-IPO assets; and then One Preserve Parkway, which is in Rockville, Maryland. And those are just markets that we're -- our view is that really are not part of the same growth profile as our other markets.","And then there's a second group of assets, which are really what we consider to be core assets for the company, but where we've been very successful at populating them with really terrific long-term contractual cash flows. And they're just an ideal mechanism for harvesting in the current capital markets environment. And those are the buildings like 125 West 55th and 1301 New York Avenue and Times Square Tower. So that's sort of how we're thinking about our asset dispositions. And we continually review the portfolio. And I think as Owen said, we're going to be marketing additional assets for sale or recapitalization, a.k.a., the way we dealt with Times Square Tower in 2014.","I also want to spend some time talking about our development activities today. And I'm going to do a little bit of that upfront, and then I'll sort of intermix it with my remarks on the markets. So this is clearly an area where we have a distinct advantage. And really what it does is it avails itself of our platform and our operational expertise. It does, in fact, makes us a different kind of a company.","As we close out the year, we received formal entitlements for 2 new development projects in Boston. The first is in Cambridge, where we received approval for a new 200,000 square foot residential building on a underutilized parcel at Cambridge Center. That's about a $100 million project. We're actively designing that project with an eye towards breaking ground early next year. This will be our fourth residential development. The project may have up to 20,000 square feet of street-level retail adjoining our other Cambridge Center assets.","Additionally, we received approvals for a 1.8 million square foot mixed-used development at North Station in Boston. And I know there's been a lot of press on this and people have asked questions, so let me try and give you a little bit of color on what the project potentially is going to look like. The project was approved for 235,000 square feet of retail podium. So that's a basement and 1, 2 or 3 levels of retail at the ground floor and rising just in front of the North Station at TD Boston Garden today. There'll be 142,000 square feet of what we refer to as low-rise office space, which will sort of be on the same plane as that retail space. And then there are going to be 3 towers on top of that platform. There's a 200,000 square foot parcel, which is zoned for a 300-plus-or-minus-room hotel; a 560,000 square foot residential tower, which right now looks like it's around 497 units, obviously that's the number that was just in our approvals; and then a 668,000 square foot tower, an office tower. And all of that is on top of about 800 below-grade parking spaces. So that's the sort of sum total of the 1.8 million square feet.","Now this is a project that we are doing as a venture with the owners of the land, which are Delaware North, the owners of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Garden. And we don't expect much to be going on in 2014. But based upon some preleasing and some interest we're having, particularly on the retail side, we're optimistic that something will happen early in 2015. Our share of the asset will be determined largely dependent upon what Delaware North desires are in terms of how much equity and desire they have to go forward on the development piece as vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis just owning the land. So I can't really give you a sense of sort of what our interest is going to be versus theirs. But overall, it's around $1 billion project sum total in terms of cost.","Let me switch to the operating environment now. So I think I would characterize the operating environment really as pretty unchanged from where we were in October, when we went through our market activity and we put forward our 2014 earnings guidance. But let me give you some color on sort of what we see going on.","If you look at our second-generation statistics, there's a couple of thoughts. In Boston, there's one transaction, which sort of skews things. There's a 41,000 square foot lease, where we actually relocated the tenants to some vacant space and backfilled that lease on an as-is basis. And if you sort of knock that transaction out because the tenant that moved to the vacant space is not included in those second-generation statistics, the increase in rent in Boston was about 7.2%. In New York City, the number looks pretty large, but it's skewed by a small deal at the General Motors Building, about 7,500 square feet, where the rent went from $83 to $100 a square foot at the low portion of that building. And then in San Francisco, most of the deals last quarter were in the retail side. But if you pull out the retail and you just look at the office leases, the jump is about 11% on a net basis, which is probably a lot more consistent with where people, I think, are thinking what rents are and our mark-to-market is, particularly in Boston and in San Francisco.","In the Greater Boston region, Cambridge clearly is still the strongest submarket that we are a part of. We are effectively 100% occupied, but that doesn't mean that we're not going to see some meaningful gains in our cash flows in 2014 and 2015. So this quarter, we did our first large renewal. The mark-to-market on about a 67,000 square foot lease was over 70% on a net basis. We're now in negotiations on an additional 225,000 square feet of 2014 and 2015 lease expirations. And there, we think the mark-to-market is going to be somewhere between 45% and 50% on a net basis. Office rents in Cambridge are now in the mid-60s, and that's about a 30% increase year-over-year. Now in addition to our new residential development, we are actively working right now with the city of Cambridge on entitlements for another 1 million square feet of density on our Cambridge Center project. That would be in 2 parts, about 600,000 square feet of office, 400,000 square feet of residential. So that's another 1 million square feet of development in Cambridge Center.","Going across the river to the Back Bay. Rents in the towers are now in the mid-70s. In the bottoms of the buildings in the Class A buildings in the Back Bay, they are in the mid-40s, which by the way is a real shock -- it's actually a shock to us. Sort of historically, it's a big discount to Cambridge. And the question is going to be as Cambridge gets hotter and hotter, how much of that activity will migrate into the city of Boston? At the Hancock Tower, we completed 40,000 square feet of renewals during the quarter. We signed a 57,000 square foot relocation in January. And we have 4 more leases involving another 141,000 square feet that are expected to be completed in the next couple of weeks. So thus far, we've done about 500,000 square feet of early renewals or relocations related to our 2015 lease expirations. 275,000 square feet of those [ph] transactions -- so the good and bad news is that they're done, but they won't actually impact our revenues until 2015 because the space is currently leased to Manulife, the former owner of the building. And when they become direct leases with Boston Properties, we will get the roll-up. On average, that roll-up is about $15 a square foot or 27% on the average in-place rent in the building.","At the Pru, we leased our last floor at 111 Huntington Avenue. That's this transaction I was describing before. And we are now in lease negotiations with an anchor tenant for our new development at 888 Boylston Street at the Pru Center. That's a 425,000 square foot, 17-storey building that we received approvals on a few years ago. It's got 365,000 square feet of office space and about 60,000 square feet of retail space. That's basically going to be an expansion of our highly productive Prudential Center retail complex. So that's very, very productive retail space. If we sign a lease, we would begin construction in late 2014 with a completion in mid-2016. That's about a $225 million development.","At 100 Federal Street in downtown, we did 2 new renewals this quarter, in the top 1\/3 of the building, with average starting rents just above $60 a square foot, which is just in line with our target when we purchased the building a few years ago. We did get a 52,000 square foot floor back. Part of the lease was BofA, that we negotiated, they had the right to give a floor back, which we expected. And we're going to experience a little bit of downtime on that for this year. Again, that's all baked into our guidance. The downtown market is not nearly as hot as the Back Bay from a rental rate perspective, but it is showing some modest improvements. Rents there are from the low-40s at the base of the buildings to in the low-60s at the top of the towers.","The suburban Boston market continues to be very, very active. Large lots of space have all but disappeared, and rents in Waltham are up 10% to 15% over the last few months, not year, months. We completed another 80,000 square feet of leases at Bay Colony during the quarter, bringing our total in that project to 245,000 square feet for the year. We're in negotiations with 4 additional tenants involving another 132,000 square feet. These include a 55,000 square foot lease with our fourth biotech life science company that would come to Bay Colony, as well as an expanding software company moving, not only from another part of the city but also from another state. We continue to see strong activity in our Waltham assets, with much of it stemming from the life sciences and the technology companies, tenants that we're now referring to as TAMI. We responded to 2 build-to-suit proposals for blocks in excess of 160,000 square feet during the quarter for the next phase of our 420,000 square foot CityPoint development in Waltham. We're not in lease negotiations, but we are in active discussions.","Going to New York City. Our fourth quarter in New York City activity on the in-service portfolio was really a continuation of the activity again that we described last quarter. We did 11 transactions with about 102,000 square feet in the operating portfolio, 3 deals at 540 Madison, which brought our total in that building to 16 for 2013. We did 2 more full floors at 510 Madison, so we did 5 full floor deals at 510 Madison. And 510 Madison now sits at 80% leased. And that's a little different from what you're seeing in the supplemental because the supplemental only shows leases that have commenced. But it's actually 80% leased at this point. Our acting and our taking rents at 540 Madison and 510 really haven't changed over the last year. And we don't foresee any increases in 2014. We think we've priced them appropriately. And we will do deals where we expect the rents are today.","Demand from our high-end financial services firms continue well into the year. Just sort of giving you a perspective on sort of the high end of the market in Midtown. So in 2013 in total, there were about 54 transactions, totaling 760,000 square feet of leases that were over $100 a square foot in the city. So this is a pickup from 2012. In 2012, there were 38 transactions for 550,000 square feet, but it's still way off the 2008 highs, when you had a 105 deals totaling almost 2.5 million square feet. As Owen and Mort suggested, our predominant user and the target tenant for the available space in our high-end Midtown buildings are hedge funds and asset managers, advisors and other entities involved in the financial services industries, but these are smaller tenants. And while the tenant activity for this market segment continues to be very encouraging, the breadth of the demand has its limits, which in fact leads us to the reason why it's been slower than we would've like getting the leasing completed at 510 Madison. It's just the tenant sizes are relatively small.","When we discussed 250 West 55th last quarter, we said we had a number of multifloor prospects that were considering the building. Well, we signed a lease with Soros Fund Management for 95,000 square feet and we are in lease negotiations with 4 additional tenants for space totaling over 175,000 square feet, so we've currently leased 571,000. And if we do all the deals that are currently in negotiation, it'd bring us to 745,000 square feet of leased or about 75% leased on the building. We continue to have active pipeline of 1- and 2-floor prospects that continue to tour the remaining space. And we have lots of users now looking at our prebuilt product, which is on the 16th and 25th floors.","At Carnegie Center, we continue to gain occupancy and extend leases. During the quarter, we did 7 more leases for 187,000 square feet. And while the life science sector is clearly at the core of the expansion, we also, as we outlined in our press release, completed a 15-year lease with NRG for a build-to-suit. NRG is an energy company, and they're moving from 90,000 square feet today to 130,000 square feet, when we deliver that building in 2016. That's about a $40 million development. It should be noted that 18 months ago, our occupancy rate at Carnegie was 82%, and today we're over 90%.","In Washington, D.C., the short-term resolution of the budget and the modification to sequestration are clearly a positive development. Now it hasn't resulted in any significant increase in GSA requirements, but the atmosphere is clearly much more constructive for office owners. Now I do want to point out that our exposure in the D.C. market is limited, particularly in the CBD. In 2013, 21% of our NOI came from our D.C. region. D.C. region being defined as Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, as well as the district. But only 38% of our income in the D.C. is generated from our CBD portfolio.","Now why is that? Well, the first thing is -- reason is that our strategy in D.C. has always been to do development. And doing development in D.C. has generally been entering into joint ventures with landowners. So while we control 4.2 million square feet in the district, our company's NOI, as a percentage from the D.C. CBD, so our in-city buildings, is only 8% of our total portfolio. Consistent with this approach, we've entered into negotiations with another landowner on a parcel that would support another 520,000 square foot development based upon some leasing. We have no 2014 lease exposure, but we will have some legal firms relocating, and we're going to have to backfill some space in '15 and '16. Our D.C. team is out in front of the transactions, and we are actively working on replacement tenants now. Currently, the D.C. CBD portfolio is 96% leased.","Now the other reason why our D.C. CBD NOI is relatively low is because the bulk of our regional activity is concentrated in Reston, which is unequivocally the strongest submarket in the entire D.C. region. We covered the vast majority of our Town Center expirations last quarter with the renewals of L-3 and the relocation of Litos [ph] from Tysons Corner to Reston. That was 368,000 square feet of transaction. And our largest near-term exposure in Reston, which is in '15, is with the GSA. And they've already given us notice that they intend to extend on a 261,000 square foot lease. Interestingly, we are in the awkward position of having 4 million square feet of space and no inventory. In fact, we're actually working with a tenant that wants to expand and we are canvassing our larger other users in an attempt to take back space to accommodate their growth. Rent in Reston Town Center continue to be between $15 to $25 a square foot above the market on the Toll Road.","Finally, going to San Francisco. In San Francisco, the CBD continues to be the strongest urban market in our portfolio, led again by the growth in demand from tech users, who continue to expand into traditional office buildings. Google expanded and renewed at Hills Plaza. Salesforce took additional space at Rincon Center. Visa moved into One Market Place (sic)] [One Market Plaza]. Neustar took space at 505 Howard, which is Foundry III, the new building from Tishman. Supercell and Microsoft leased space at 55 Cal, the former BofA building. In the last few weeks, Twitter, Dropbox and Zoom have all expanded. And LinkedIn and Trulia and Pinterest are all in the market looking for 100,000 square feet or more of expansion. The pace of activity in the city in '13 was right in line with 2012, [indiscernible] of change, 8.2 million square feet of additional activity. Activity from the technology industry actually as a percentage of the market went down in 2013 from about 2\/3 in '12 to 50% in '13. Yet the tech activity actually didn't decline, but there were more traditional users back in the market and there are more traditional lease expirations in the '15 to '17 timeframe, which are hitting the market today.","At Boston Properties, we leased all of our available space at 50 Hawthorne, 56,000 square feet, to athenahealth for occupancy during the second quarter of 2014. And this quarter, we completed another 100,000 square feet of leasing at EC. Three more full floors, 1 of them at EC4 in the middle of the building at starting rents in the mid-70s. These space rents in the city continue to be running from the mid-70s to over $90 a square foot. Our 2014 to 2016 mark-to-market at Embarcadero Center runs between 15% and 25% on a lease-by-lease basis. The construction of 535 Mission is on schedule, and we are in active lease negotiations with a technology tenant for the lower floors of the building, somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 square feet, with an expected occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2014, contemporaneous with the building delivery. When we commenced the development, we expected to start to see demand as the building structure and the skin began to take form, and this is exactly what is going on. We are very encouraged by the inquiries and [indiscernible] plans that tenants are putting through us in the building.","If we average leases with starting rents in the mid-60s, that's on a gross basis, this investment will generate a low 7% cash NOI return. And I want to sort of compare that to the latest building sale in the city, which is at 101 Second Avenue, high-quality building built in the late '90s, sold for $767 a square foot, a sub-4% current return, about 20% availability, some below-market rents, but it doesn't get to a stabilized number for 3 or 4 years. Compared to this building, which we're developing for about $700 a square foot and our building at 680 Folsom Street, which we're developing for about $620 a square foot and is going to yield somewhere in excess of 6%. The subgrade work at Transbay is progressing and our marketing program is in full swing. We are in active discussions with a number of tenants and could deliver the building in late '16 or early '17 based on our current schedule. But we have not made a decision yet to move forward on the structure out of the ground.","As we head into 2014, our investment activities obviously are now focused highly on our development pipeline. Just to summarize, 680 Hawthorne [ph] and 50 Folsom [ph], $340 million dollars, is going to deliver in the second quarter. 535 Mission, $215 million investment, is going to deliver at end of 2014. AJ 7 [ph], which is fully leased to the GSA up in Annapolis Junction, $18 million is our share of that, is going to be delivering in the second quarter of 2015. 601 Mass Ave, which is leased to Arnold & Porter, $350 million investment, is going to deliver in the fourth quarter of '15. 804 Carnegie Center, fully leased to NRG, $40 million investment, is going to deliver in the first half of 2016. And now our potential future developments include: 888 Boylston Street, $225 million; our Cambridge Center residential, $100 million; North Station, which is our $1 billion investment I described; 10 and 20 CityPoint, which is about $150 million investment; and the Transbay Tower, $1 billion. We also have active projects in D.C. and Reston and our New York City team is in active discussions on a number of new projects.","I'm going to stop there and turn things over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug talked about, we had a pretty busy quarter. We closed on 3 sales. We raised about $760 million in proceeds. And all 3 of these sales had significant gains, aggregating almost $400 million and demonstrating the value creation we bring through the development and the management of our properties.","Our cash balances now total almost $2.4 billion. As a reminder, we announced the $2.25 per share special dividend that totals $385 million. That actually gets paid today. We also plan to repay our $748 million of exchangeable notes that mature on February 15. So after these payments, we will still continue to have substantial liquidity. And because of that position, we don't necessarily project raising any additional debt capital or equity capital in 2014, though as Doug and Owen mentioned, additional asset sales remain a possibility.","Our portfolio continues to generate really strong performance. And as we anticipated, our fourth quarter 2013 cash same-store NOI growth was 5.9% over the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, we generated over 5% cash same-store NOI growth from 2012 and our same-store occupancy improved by 210 basis points during the year to 93.2%.","For the fourth quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.29 per share. That was $0.05 per share or about $8 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio was about $3.5 million ahead of our budget. This was mostly due to lower-than-projected operating expenses. Part of this was in our real estate taxes where we've received actual assessments for several of our municipalities that were lower than our projections were. We generated $2.5 million stronger fee income than we projected with better-than-expected services income, tenant improvement and development fees. And then we just completed our annual compensation process and our G&A expenses came in at the low end of our guidance, reducing the expense by about $2 million from the midpoint.","Looking forward to 2014, our projections will be impacted by the sale of One Preserve Parkway and 10 & 20 Mall Road, which were not included in our prior guidance. These 2 properties were projected to generate $6.5 million in 2014. So the sales impact our FFO guidance by about $0.04 per share. As Doug talked about, we continue to have good leasing activity, particularly in the Boston region. The strengthening activity in Boston is outperforming our prior expectations and is projected to offset the loss of income from the sales during 2014. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we have a few large lease expirations at the Prudential Center in Boston and in suburban San Francisco that is built into our guidance. This will temporarily reduce our occupancy by over 300,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue at the Prudential Center until Blue Cross Blue Shield commences their lease in early 2015. Overall, these vacancies will cost about 100 basis points of occupancy in the portfolio and $12 million of revenue loss year-over-year. We have positive absorption though elsewhere in the portfolio, and overall, we continue to expect our occupancy to remain relatively stable through 2014, averaging between 92.5% and 93.5%. The lost revenue from these move outs will temper our NOI growth, but due to strong growth at other properties, that include Bay Colony, 510 Madison Avenue, Reston Town Center, Embarcadero Center and others, we're projecting same-store GAAP NOI will grow in 2014 by 1.25% to 2.5% over 2013. This is a slight increase over last quarter's guidance. In line with what we guided last quarter on a cash basis, we project our 2014 same-store NOI to be up substantially by 5% to 6% over 2013. That equates to $60 million to $70 million of additional cash net operating income. Some of the improvement emanates from the burn off of free rent at buildings like the Hancock Tower, at Cambridge Center and at 399 Park Avenue, with the rest coming from leasing activity.","Our non-cash, straight line and fair value lease revenue for 2014 is projected to be $80 million to $90 million. That's up $5 million from last quarter's guidance and it includes $30 million from our developments. We improved the pre-leasing in our development pipeline this quarter with the signing of 56,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, bringing the project to 96% leased and the signing of 95,000 square feet at 250 West 55th Street where we're now 58% leased. Both of these projects, as well as The Avant residential building in Reston will be in lease-up during 2014 and they'll only contribute a fraction of their fully stabilized run rate. The contribution from our development deliveries to 2014 is in line with our prior guidance and is projected to add $28 million to $30 million of incremental NOI from last year. When stabilized, these projects, that total $1.5 billion of investment, are projected to generate an aggregate return in the low- to mid-6% range and contribute meaningful earnings growth.","The projection for our hotel is in line with last quarter. It's expected to generate 2014 NOI of $12 million to $13 million. The contribution to FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures is also in line with our prior guidance and it's projected to be $29 million to $34 million in 2014. We project our fee income from development and management services to be $19 million to $22 million in 2014. Our outperformance in fees generated in the fourth quarter were primarily nonrecurring in nature, so our 2014 quarterly run rate is expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of '13 performance.","For our G&A line item, we are projecting expense of $100 million to $104 million for the year. Our interest expense projections are in line with last quarter. With a pay-off of $748 million of exchangeable notes that have a GAAP interest rate of 6% in February and a $63 million 5.5% rate expiring mortgage loan in October, our interest expense run rate will drop significantly in 2014. The expense reduction from a lower debt balance will be partially offset by a decline in capitalized interest as several of our developments deliver. We're projecting ceasing capitalized interest on The Avant project in February, 680 Folsom in midyear and 250 West 55th Street in October. We currently project net interest expense of $448 million to $452 million and that includes capitalized interest of $54 million to $58 million for the full year of '14. Combining all of our assumptions, we're projecting 2014 funds from operations of $5.20 to $5.33 per share. After accounting for the loss of $0.04 per share from the sale of One Preserve Parkway and 10 & 20 Mall Road, our guidance represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint of our guidance from last quarter. All of it is emanating from stronger core portfolio performance.","For the first quarter, we project funds from operation of $1.21 to $1.23 per share. As you probably recall from previous years, the first quarter is projected to be down from the fourth quarter in '13, happens every year, due to the seasonality of our hotel and the first quarter G&A, which is typically higher that includes higher vesting and payroll tax expense. This year, we also have the lost income from our property sales that we sold in the fourth quarter and that's partially offset by lower projected interest expense. Once again, our projections do not include the impact of any potential acquisition or disposition activity. As we've discussed today, we anticipate, we'll be marketing additional properties for sale in 2014, which, if we execute on them, will reduce our funds from operation until the proceeds can be reinvested, which would most likely be in our growing development opportunities. That completes our formal remarks for today. Operator, if you could open the line up for questions, that will be great. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie. I'm here with Jeff. I thought your comments on D.C. were particularly interesting, that there's been a bit of change in tone and sentiment. Ray, do you mind talking a little bit more about what you're seeing in the market and what you see going forward, given a more cooperative environment on Capitol Hill?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, it's very hard for us to comment, Jamie, because we don't have tremendous amount of vacancy. As was mentioned, we did get notice from one of our major defense contractor agencies out in Reston that they plan to renew and extend their lease there, which is very positive. We're obviously making similar plans to renew and keep many of our R&D tenants down in our Springfield development, VA 95. Just anecdotally, hearing from our friends in the other buildings, there is activity, but no real major commitments. The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor is still is pretty challenged. I think Pornaydo [ph] is doing a great job backfilling their vacancy, but still not the big GSA deals we anticipate. We're hopeful that FBI is going to come out. We're one of the finalists for that. That would be a tremendous boom, not only for us, but to the entire Northern Virginia market. So while there is an uptick and good vibes, still no -- will go to leases we can point to as really changing the tide in the market.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about city space and given the lease renewal downtown, what you think will happen in your portfolio? And then I think we also heard maybe Reed Smith would be signing somewhere else? Can you talk about that? And then I think you also -- I thought I heard Doug mention, you're in active discussions over a few potential new development projects in New York. I just want to make sure I heard that right and if so, can you provide a little more color?","Douglas T. Linde","So you asked 3 questions. I'll try and hit them sequentially in reverse order. We are talking about a number of developments in New York City and there's nothing that we're, at this point, prepared to talk about specifically, in terms of the location of the site. With regards to our law firm tenants in our portfolio, we're in active discussions with each and every law firm tenant that we have as a lease expiration between 2015 and 2020 and as we are not aware of any tenant that has made a decision to leave any of our buildings. With regards to Citibank, there's no question that Citibank is going to be relocating out of 399. That headquarter's requirement has hardly been used on a relative basis in terms of the efficiency of the space for them for a number of years and much of it has been sub-let. Some of it is retail. I mean, we think we said last quarter, that of 500,000-plus-or-minus square feet, about 350,000 square feet of that is Citibank office space that we're going to get back sometime in 2017. At 601 Lexington Avenue, Citibank has a large requirement. They have the right to give back 1 floor or 2 in 2000 -- I think '16 or '17. And the rest of it is for lease until 2026. And I'm sure that as they think about how they're going to handle the various users they have in Long Island City and downtown and in Midtown, that's going to be part of the equation and we're going to have conversations with them about whether or not they want to use that space. And if they don't want to use that space, how we both might profit from their decision to no longer want to pay rent there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just like to hear if you could elaborate a little bit on [indiscernible] generally. It seems that there's quite a bit of availability still downtown. Hudson Yards, developments potentially, approaching tenants 7 by [ph] Park was just mentioned in the previous [indiscernible]. I am curious about the sort of the [indiscernible] development that you'd be considering. Would it be office? And just general thoughts on the market and tenant demand outside of maybe the high-end financial service tenants.","Douglas T. Linde","Sure, I'll start, and John Powers, if you'd like to make some comments, feel free to add on. So, the developments that we're looking at are, I think, what you would consider to be in sync with our views on where we think the demand is going to be coming from in the short- to medium-term in New York City, a.k.a., buildings that would be more apropos for the growing technology companies and the media companies and the content delivery companies, not the large financial institutions. And so obviously, to the extent that those locations are slightly different than where those tenants currently, our portfolio currently is tilted, obviously those are the types of places that we're looking at. I think we've also been pretty clear that we think we have a residential expertise that we're now capitalizing on in New York, Boston and in Washington, D.C., and there are a number of sites that have been identified to us and that we have made inquiries on the residential side as well in New York City. I don't think those there would be considered to be mixed-use centers. There would be residential projects where we think we have the competency and the capability to execute at a highly attractive return. So those are the kinds of things that we're talking about on the development side. John, if you want to comment on sort of the amount of new construction that's potentially going up and sort of the environment is back [ph], feel free [ph].","John Francis Powers","Well, certainly, the downtown market has a lot of availability in large blocks. It's about 6 million feet that's available or will be available shortly there. Obviously, we don't have any product downtown. Also, the Midtown South market is very, very hot right now. There's been a number of deals that were just done over the last couple of months there and rents have really started to spike in some of those buildings. So there's going to be tenants in that Midtown South market that are going to be squeezed out because many of those tenants went there because their businesses did not have the margins to be in Midtown. So there's a transition with technology expanding in New York and I think that there will be some tenants that moved from Midtown to downtown to take advantage of the new product or the repositioned product with large blocks and attractive prices. But the Midtown market and the Manhattan market overall is very, very large. So when you're dealing with a market of over 350 million square feet, even a few million here and a few million there don't change the aggregate supply and demand ratio. And the Midtown, the market is still solid. I wouldn't say it's moving up tremendously, but there's very little downward pressure on it, on rents.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, and quick follow-up for that [ph]. Ray, I saw the Lerner's project in Tysons get announced. I'm curious, given sort of the availability to accommodate expansion, because you're full in Reston. Are you concerned about migrating into the Tysons [indiscernible] getting a little bit more traction?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, it's interesting, Jordan. The tenant that was -- the Reston tenant that was referenced earlier, is one of the highest profile tenants in the United States currently in the Reston Town Center and are literally begging us to buy out existing tenants so they don't have to go to Tysons. And we have seen absolutely no departures from Reston to Tysons and in fact, the major deal we secured earlier this year was the Litos [ph] deal, well, was a mainstay at Tysons who came to Reston at a probably about a 50% premium in rent to move just the 6 miles out to Reston. And this is before Metro even came. Now where as they left Tysons with Metro to come to Town Center, pay more without Metro. So I think that's a very strong indication of how we feel about the Reston versus Tyson dynamic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Attie from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On Transbay, can you elaborate on the activity you're seeing in terms of the size of the tenants you're speaking with, their industries and also from a timing perspective, can you remind us when you need to move forward on construction in order to deliver in early 2017?","Raymond A. Ritchey","So, I am going to -- I apologize that my answer is not going to be as forthright as you would like it to be, but it's the reality of sort of the situation. We are talking to a number of tenants that are in a broad range of industries. We are clearly talking to technology tenants and we are clearly talking to traditional [indiscernible] tenants, i.e., financial institutions and law firms and other sort of money manager advisor types about the building. Obviously, anybody who we're talking to is in excess of 100,000 square feet. That sort of -- we're not prepared to enter into any conversations with smaller tenants at this point. The building is currently on a program, just as I said, to be completed, if we were not to cease construction, in '16 or '17, and the decision as to when we stop is a decision that gets made in the middle of 2014. We can obviously delay that even longer. There's just some cost implications associated with that.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And if and when you decide to move forward, have you kind of given thought to bringing in a capital partner and have you kind of decided internally whether that's something that you want to do or not want to do?","Owen D. Thomas","Josh, this is Owen Thomas. I don't think our posture on that question has changed since the last quarter. We, I would say firmly believe it's an option that we have, given the quality of the building and the capital that's available in the marketplace for real estate. But we haven't made that decision yet, but it's an option that we may elect to hit at a future date. But again, no decision has been made.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just want to follow-up on Josh's questions, just a quick one on Transbay. Are there any tax incentives from the city or the state around this project? And if there are, do they impact timing and construction and does this put any constraints on the marketing process?","Owen D. Thomas","Unfortunately, there are no tax incentives that are sort of egging on demand. As you might appreciate, given the amount of absorption that the city of San Francisco has seen and the amount of activity in the marketplace and the desirability of being in the urban area, the city really doesn't have much in the way of incentives. Interesting thing is that as I think we talked about in the past, we're subject actually to an additional tax because we are in an area where there are Mello-Roos bonds that were -- had to be floated to pay for the Transbay Terminal. So it's sort of actually in the opposite direction. We have a slightly higher tax base than a traditional office building. Not one obviously that's being sold at $800 a square foot because our cost is not going to be there. But overall, there are no tax incentives that would incentivize tenants to move forward.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then this may be a bit premature, but I was just curious, are there standards that you're designing to relative to the occupancy sort of per person on a square foot basis? I would think you'd have to begin to incorporate some of that into egress and elevators and bathrooms and so forth. And does that impact the -- I guess my question is, does that impact the tenant type that you can really target through the marketing process?","Douglas T. Linde","This building -- and Bob Pester, if you want to comment, please feel free. This building is being designed to probably be maximize the density with which one can populate a floor in a high-rise building. There are 3 exit stairs. There are a number of extra capacity HVAC and electrical supplies in the building for cooling and for power usage and we have a Miconic destination elevator system that we believe will be able to push people through the building as rapidly as you can possibly find. So it's -- our view is it's sort of at the cutting edge in all of those indices. And it's about as good as it can get.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then just one final question, more of a big picture. Given the timing on this project, which is quite long on a relative basis, are there any reasons for caution in your view relative to your employment expectations a couple of years out? Or do you feel that the strength of the market is really still quite broad and is a relatively safe zone for you guys to market this project?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","This is Mort Zuckerman speaking. When we go and explore the possibility of starting a building like this, we have extended meetings with the brokerage community, which I was fortunate to attend. And I will tell you that -- and I'm not exaggerating, and all the ridiculous number of years that I've been in the real estate business, I never heard from the brokerage community a list and a detailed list of the kind of action that there is in the San Francisco market in terms of tenants who are not only new tenants coming into the market, but tenants that were in the market and are growing. And way overwhelming the amount of new space coming in. And since this building we believe will be the iconic building in San Francisco, we have found that the kind of interest that we are receiving to reflect that kind of activity. So we didn't start it just in a vacuum. We started it within the context of the most bullish description of the market based on specific information about tenants that were growing or tenants that were making new commitments or new tenants coming into the market. I can recall at that point, when I was asked to comment on it, I happened to have a sore throat and I said the sore throat I got was from privately cheering when I listened to this kind of report. So I think we've had a lot of experience in terms of making these kinds of judgments in various markets. But I will tell you, that this was the single by far, the single most, shall we say enthusiastic or bullish, name it as you would like, description of active tenants, specific tenants in the marketplace and units of demand that made us feel very comfortable about going ahead with the buildings. And I think we will be able to justify that to you in reasonable time zones, so that you will understand why we are as enthusiastic about it as we were and made the commitments that we did.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just one more question on Transbay and then 535 Mission. On Transbay, I'm just curious if you can give us any color on maybe how intense or numerous your leasing discussions are versus maybe 3 months ago? And then also just curious on 535, how the activity is there and will success or not there still translate into your decision on Transbay?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll repeat what I said previously and I hope this is more satisfactory. 535, we are in active lease negotiations with a major technology tenant for the bottom of that building and assuming that, that lease gets signed, we're going to be over 100,000 square feet committed, and they're not the only tenant that we are talking to. We have single-floor and multi-floor tenants that we're in negotiations with and there is great demand for that building right now. So I guess net, net, I'd say the optimistic end of our expectations in terms of where we thought rents would be and where we thought the overall demand would be are being realized in a consistent manner. With regards to the Transbay Tower, we are now working in the ground, pouring our footings, doing our foundation work and there is a consistency of conversations, both within Boston Properties and direct tenant negotiations, as well as Boston Properties brokers and other brokers asking for information on a pretty consistent basis. And I would say that the overall tone of the market in the first quarter of 2014 is probably slightly better than the tone of the market was in the fourth quarter of 2013. That doesn't mean that we feel like we're going to announce a major lease in the next 3 days, but like I said, we're feeling good about the overall market demand, as Mort just described. If you would see what the statistics look like in the first quarter, you're going to see a number of large users that have committed to expansion in San Francisco. The Transbay Tower is very much a building and a project that is on anybody and everyone's radar screen when it comes to looking to fulfill their growth needs, because there's just relatively little other demand in the marketplace. And Bob, you can describe some of the other buildings that are being discussed and sort of where the demand is. So we're feeling as good as we did last quarter and the market is feeling a little bit better.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then 2 quick ones on my last question. 250 West, you still going to hit 90% by the end of the year? And then 888 Boylston has always struck me as a home run waiting to happen, but curious if you can just talk about the dynamics of maybe competing with yourself there versus Hancock and maybe you feel better about that now?","Owen D. Thomas","Sure. So, on 250 West 55th Street, like I said, if we get all the leases that John and his team are negotiating right now, we'll be at 75%. Do I think we'll get to 90% by the end of December of 2014? I think it's a stretch. Do I think we'll get to 80% or 85%, I hope. That's sort of where our goal is. And a lot of those tenants, obviously, are going to be in occupancy, not in '14, but in '15. So leases that have commenced and leases that have been signed are slightly different. With regards to 888 Boylston Street, it's a building that we have been very patient about in terms of starting, given the profile of the building, where it sits and the fact that there's both retail and office demand. The tenant that we are talking to is the tenant that would be taking the lower portion of the building, which would leave us with the better base, relatively speaking, from a view perspective. And the space that we now have available at the Hancock Tower, as we look into our leasing expirations in 2015 and beyond, are at the base of the building. So the actual mix of where the product is in the marketplace actually sort of works well together and puts us, we think, in the best position to be successful with both projects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So given that some of the approvals you're getting for development has a multi-family component and you mentioned the residential expertise, how do you view this long-term? Would you say there are plans to increase the multi-family mix meaningfully? As something that's complementary to office and less cyclical even in strong office markets like San Francisco? Do you have any evolving views on the target mix?","Owen D. Thomas","So, I'll answer the question in the following manner, which is: Boston Properties has a development expertise, which we believe is wholly transferable to urban residential development projects. And so, as we think about utilizing our knowledge of the markets and our expertise in identifying sites and our credibility with public officials where you need approvals for residential, we think it aligns significantly well with our other competencies and capabilities. And so that's where our focus is. I would not want us to give you the impression that we are suddenly becoming a residential company or that we're trying to effectuate our mix. But I think the reality is, is that there are a number of sites that are better utilized for residential development in these urban markets that we happen to be wholly involved in and we think we have the capabilities to take advantage of those marketplaces and we think we should do that.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then the lower G&A, it helped a bit in informing [ph] your guidance range for the New Year and it's going to be seasonally higher in the first quarter. But do you think we could see additional efficiencies if you're successful in monetizing assets? In other words, what do you think the sensitivity is on the G&A line to portfolio shifts going forward?","Michael E. LaBelle","It will depend on if we become a recapitalized partner of those assets or a seller of those assets. In terms of sort of creating additional management fees. But I think, on the margin, it's not going to make much of an impact because we don't expect to do anything that's going to dramatically change our overall overhead.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then Mike had mentioned real estate taxes in general. Can anyone share the latest thoughts on working with Mayor de Blasio in the New Year and which way do you think property taxes are headed in New York?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I'll make a comment on that. Now that -- I doubt if there is going to be a special tax on those people whose incomes are in excess of $500 million -- or net worth is in excess of $500 million or whatever his criteria is. I certainly think that like all other cities, there's going to be some pressure on the real estate tax basis, but I don't think it's going to be anything dramatic. I think it'll be just within the normal range of expectations, in part because I think the idea that there's going to be major increases in city expenses that is unprecedented or unanticipated, I think it has been narrowed by the -- shall we say, the experience that the mayor has had with the governor on these issues, and not to be able to go too far, as to the governor said, the major program that he had, which was pre-K education, is now going to be funded by the state government and not by the city. So I think the city is going to be in better shape financially and able to handle whatever the increase in expenses will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions for me. The first up, as you guys look at potentially doing some development in New York, would all this be market rate, or are you underwriting some degree of incentives? If we just think about some of the big developments that are underway right now, they're clearly benefiting from attractive financing, whether it's the far West Side or downtown that allows them to price new construction sort of below where market rate new construction would price. So if you could just give some thoughts on that?","Owen D. Thomas","Alex, it's Owen Thomas. I think the types of things that we're looking at are all over the map. I wouldn't say they're necessarily driven by the incentives that you're describing.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, appreciate that response. The next question is just as you think about disposition activity and capital retention, can you just sort of break out how you think about the development activity, how much capital you'll need? And then as you look at dispositions as a source, clearly, the smaller ones, you can retain the cash. But the bigger assets like Times Square Tower, you have to dividend out. So if you can just walk us through how you think about using dispositions to fund versus the potential to see another Times-Square-Tower-like disposition where we would see a special dividend?","Owen D. Thomas","Again, I apologize if this answer doesn't wholly satisfy you, but we actually don't link the 2 things together. The decisions that we're making to sell assets when we're selling assets, as I said earlier, are sort of in those 2 buckets, and they're wholly unconnected to our capital needs. One of the most -- more interesting things about our portfolio is that as we deliver all of these developments over the next 3 or 4 years, our ability to have capacity to increase the overall debt capabilities and capacity of the company actually increases pretty dramatically because we have a lot more income coming online relative to how we're currently funding ourselves. And so we don't look out over the next 3 or 4 years and say, \"Geez, in order to fund ourselves at a comparable leverage position as we're in today, we need to sell assets and have to retain that capital.\" So the decisions are really not linked together.","Michael E. LaBelle","And I would also add that our liquidity position today is more than sufficient to complete what is left to fund on the pipeline. There's -- we have a $2.5 million pipeline with about $750 million left to go over the next few years. So if you assume we pay off the exchangeables, we pay the special dividend, and we pay all of those development dollars, we still have significant cash balances to fund some of these future developments that Doug talked about, in addition to the cash flows generated by the portfolio on an annual basis.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So Doug, if I hear you correctly, it almost sounds like a Times-Square-Tower-type situation where you would get -- where shareholders would get a special would almost be sort of like a reverse inquiry or where you just saw just cap rate demand in the market so strong that it was too good to pass up. It almost sounds like it's that way. Is that fair?","Douglas T. Linde","Yes. I wouldn't characterize it as being that reactive. I think Owen and Mort and I and the rest of the managers are spending time looking at our assets and saying, \"Geez, let's look at the cash flows in a particular building over the next decade or so and how do we feel about the growth from this cash flow and how do we feel about how the market might value this asset. And should we think, is this the right time to, in some way, shape or form liquidate that investment?\" And if we can put that capital into a better use in order -- if we have to return to shareholders, we'll return it to our shareholders relative to what our own expectations are. And so it's that type of a mental process that's going on with regards to how we're thinking about our dispositions, not one where we're saying, \"Okay. We have X million dollars of development, and we have a limited resource base. And therefore, we have to sell some assets in order to invest assets in other buildings.\" Because as I said, the cash flow profile of all the activity we currently have going on in our development pipeline is pretty significant in terms of the overall cash flow growth, and it really allows us to feel very comfortable about what our overall capitalization is and our leverage ratios and our coverage ratios on a going-forward basis without having to really be too concerned about what the impacts of reducing our overall balance sheet are in terms of selling assets and being in a situation where we may have to provide a special dividend.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","If I may, I'd like to just add one other comment to that. In 2006, you may recall we sold a number of buildings, actually, 14 of them to be exact. And we did that because we thought it was the right time to establish the values that we had created, and we didn't do it in terms of, as Doug said, because we were looking forward to having the money to spend on new developments. We really do feel that we have that financial capacity in our -- in the ordinary course of life. And when we do decide to sell, it's because we think it's the right time to sell the assets that we're selling. And I think this is -- given, as we all know, the level of interest rates today, there has been a dramatic appreciation in the value of the kinds of assets that we have, and we get a lot of inquiries. And so it's something that we feel is appropriate to respond to in exactly the terms that Doug has just described, just as we did in 2000 -- let's say 6 years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the disposition side a little bit. Just curious if the environment has changed much over the last 90 days in terms of buyer being more aggressive? You had mentioned that it's still hard to make the acquisitions pencil for yourselves. Are people -- is there more demand for those core assets than there was 90 days ago? And maybe the same question on the suburban assets. I know you sold the 2 this quarter. But are you seeing an increasing demand for those types of assets?","Owen D. Thomas","It's Owen. I would say that for the core CBD assets, I think the market interest in those assets and the capital that's interested in pursuing those types of assets has been high, and it's been pretty consistent from 2013 to today. As you know, interest rates, the 10-year has risen substantially from its lows in the middle of 2013, and I think that's had pretty minimal impact on cap rates, except for what I'd describe as highly leverageable assets. But for the types of assets that we own, core, multi-tenant, real estate in urban locations, I think the intensity of the capital will stay pretty consistent. For suburban, I don't think that the level of market enthusiasm for suburban office is certainly as high as it is for urban office. I don't think that the cap rate for suburban office are -- relative to history, are as interesting to us as a seller as they are for the CBD, if you look at the cap rates versus history. With that being said, I think if the economy improves, I think investors will do what they've done in the past. They'll look for -- they'll take additional risk and chase higher yields. And my guess is if the economy continues to improve that the interest level in suburban office will increase. This coming year would be my guess.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like there hasn't been a [indiscernible].","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Can I comment to that? Hello?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, sure.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","This is Mort. Look, one of the unique features of the inventory of buildings in Boston Properties is that a lot of them are iconic buildings that are known not just in the markets we are in, but literally across the country and, in fact, in many other international markets, okay? So we get an interest from investors who are really outside the United States because they understand and recognize our buildings, and we don't have to, in a sense, shall we say, persuade people as to the quality of the buildings we have. We have such an array of iconic and high-quality buildings that are recognized everywhere, but there is a demand for that, that is not totally independent of interest rates, obviously, but much more dependent upon, shall we say, and compared to many other purchasers, just sort of the recognition of the assets and the understanding that these are iconic assets with great long-term values.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I could add just one more question on the North Station project. As you think about sort of start to finish after factoring all the phasing of the different components, I mean, how long a development process does that look like?","Owen D. Thomas","You're asking me to look at a crystal ball and describe what the demand's going to be for all the various product types. I believe that our current plan is as follows, which is: we're going to try and get as much leasing as we possibly can on the retail and the low-rise office, and we're going to commence on either 1 or 2 of those phases. And there are sort of 2 different sides of the site. Hopefully, sometime in early 2015, knock on wood, tenant demand being with us. And then the other -- the 3 towers, I think, are going to be predicated on market conditions at that time. We're creating the structure for the towers in the buildings. So we'll be in a position where we can actually get going whenever we want to on the vertical portions of the site. But look, it's going to be $1 billion-plus-or-minus of investment is going to take a minimum of 5 years to get out the door in totality. And it could take longer than that.","Michael E. LaBelle","[indiscernible] Doug's point on the phase-ability is a key attribute of this particular project, but we're also blessed with having a partner with the Jacobs family in the Delaware North that has the same type of perspective we have, which is long term, and then also making sure that it's absolutely the right product at the right time. This is a legacy project for them and property, and they've been very patient in the development of putting in infrastructure into the site, and we couldn't ask for a better partner that has the same type of long-term perspective that we do.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","And if I may say, when you get a sense of the quality of the -- and integration of all the different uses and the quality of the design, I think this will be recognized almost instantaneously as another iconic development that as we hope being our hallmark. So I think this is just going to have a unique appeal for all the reasons that have just been mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Aslakson from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could -- you kind of already hit on this a little bit, Doug, earlier, but if you could just kind of walk through the development costs for your major developments that are underway on a per-square-foot basis, which I guess we can calculate there in the supplement, but then also what you think those costs will be relative to the potential stabilized value of each of those projects?","Douglas T. Linde","That could take 20 or 30 minutes to do, Erin.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I don't want to take that much time.","Douglas T. Linde","I'll just say -- I'll say the following: For the most part, the developments that we have, where we haven't articulated what the first group [ph] of costs are, are interesting for the portfolio because our land basis is relatively small, and what we're sort of -- how we describe the returns on these assets is predicated on what a market value for the land is. So when you -- at the end of the day, when you look at what the cost that we put into the building is from a GAAP perspective and the returns, it's going to look higher than what we're describing because the market land value is a figment of our internal imaginations. It's not reality. It's not what we actually paid for these sites. In general, we are building our buildings today on a lease basis, hopefully with a starting cash-on-cash return in the high-6s to low-7s, include -- that's with the market value of land, and somewhere that we believe is $100 or $200 a square foot below where other people are currently purchasing assets at lower returns. I mean, that's sort of the logic for why we are developing as opposed to, as Owen said, beating ourselves up trying to buy low-yielding assets with operating cash flow risk associated with them. And each and every one of our assets is on that spectrum in one place or another, and there are some [ph] in every single one of the leases that we are negotiating, so those early returns obviously go up over time. So on a GAAP basis, they're higher, and we think we're creating significant value each and every time. I mean, I've said from day 1 and I'll say it again, at the end of the day, after all of the starting and stopping, the cash-on-cash return at 250 West 55th Street, which I don't consider to be our strongest performer, is going to be in excess of 6%, and that includes rents on a 1 million square feet that are going to go up by $7 or $8 a square foot every 5 years. So you can figure out sort of what the average returns are. And in general, we're signing 15- or 20-year leases. I mean, that was sort of a -- in my opinion, a underperforming asset in terms of where we had hoped to be when we started it. And everything that we're doing now, we have a higher expectation of where we think we're going to come out on a return basis.","Michael E. LaBelle","I would just add that, as Doug mentioned, we're using the market value for the land, which is driving some of those return numbers that you quoted, and some of these developments, for example, at 888 Boylston Street and others that we have, we've owned this land for a long time. So there's a pretty significant difference in some of these cases between the market value of the land and what we actually have in the land.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Perrotta from Goldman Sachs.","Ron J. Perrotta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just real quick. Given this emphasis on development, anything that we should think about as far as leverage targets or where you see the balance sheet going over the next few quarters or years as that pipeline continues to ramp up? I know you touched on it -- a little bit about the debt repayments coming this year, but anything else to add on that front?","Michael E. LaBelle","As Doug started to mention, as we kind of look forward, we're talking about increasing our cash NOI. We're talking about putting $2.5 billion of development pipeline into service without raising additional debt, where a big portion of the cash is already out the door. So our leverage is going to naturally go down as that happens. Right now, if you look at a net cash EBITDA, we've been in the high-6s to low-7s. That will come down as that occurs. And I would not expect that we're going to modify the leverage policies that we have, which is somewhere in the low-6s to low-7s on a net debt EBITDA over time, as we continue to make investments in our development or dispose of assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","In your prepared remarks, you made reference to your expectation that rates would be rising. How difficult is it to underwrite developments with that expectation in mind? Are we taking to rent projections in those numbers today?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, we do factor it in when we think about returns that we'd like to achieve. And any financing that would be used for developments, we don't use the current rates. We assume some level of increases. So we're -- again, as I mentioned, it's very hard to predict interest rates. I think the general feeling we have and the market has is they're going to rise. Given some of the mixed signals that we're getting from the marketplace economically, the pace of that rise and when it's going to occur and how large it will be is the hard part to predict. But we are factoring in rate rises into our development analysis.","Douglas T. Linde","So David, when we provide information to the Street and when you look at our supplemental, we obviously have a cost of capital in every single one of our developments. There's a cost of equity, and there's a cost of debt. And those numbers, as interest rates move up, obviously move up. Overall, we also look at our -- we don't look at things on an incremental basis. We sort of look at what our average cost of capital is and what our average cost of debt is and what might happen to that on a portfolio basis over time. And interestingly, we just sort of went through a strong long analysis of sort of where our overall debt has been, and we're basically funding on an overall basis right now of just under 5%. And we have a modest amount of maturities that are going to actually bring that number down slightly over the next 2 to 3 years, assuming no dramatic increase in rates, and we don't have much in the way of rollover during that period of time. So the good news about our balance sheet is that we've done, I believe -- I think, a pretty good job of timing our exposures to the marketplace and extending out our maturities over the past 2 or 3 years to really put ourselves in a pretty good position, certainly for the next 7 to 10 years. And so we -- I think we have a good handle on where our fundamental cost of capital is on the debt side. And so as we do these developments, there is no question that there's a potential being -- there's a squeeze that could happen if you say, \"Well, you're developing to a 7% return and interest rates have gone from 4% to 7% on an \"incremental basis.\" But that's not how we are looking at these investments, and that's not how we look at our balance sheet.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, let me ask you this on a more precise basis. If you were contemplating a development today, would you be looking for higher returns today than you would've been 12 to 9 months ago when rates were in the -- with the 1 handle on the 10-year treasury yield?","Owen D. Thomas","I'll answer the question in the following manner: I would say that every conversation that our senior management team has with our development people, we say to them, \"Hey, guys, interest rates are going up. And if interest rates are going up, we need to think about what our return levels are going to be because obviously our cost of development and our cost of capital is a factor in that transaction.\"","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are you including rent projections in these calculations today?","Owen D. Thomas","We never include rent projections in our development deals in terms of increases in rent projections. We only assume where we think rents are today and where we think we're going to be able to lease. But if there's -- if we're doing a build-to-suit, obviously, the rent is going to be what the rent is and where we think the rent is going to be on the other space. And there are so many other factors associated with the other spaces. Where is it located in the building? Is it going to be encumbered by a right of first offer, or is it going to be space-pocketed? Is it -- which means it has a shorter duration. I mean, there's just lots of factors that impact that, but we don't generally say, \"Well, we're going to do this development, and we're going to assume rents go up by 5% a year, so that makes it all pencil up.\" That's not the way we approach things.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I have a question on the common dividend. It's not -- it's remained unchanged now for 5 quarters and still actually is below the level at which it peaked out in 2008. Are you ruling out, or is there any comment, perhaps, you, Mort, can make with regard to the prospects for any growth this year?","Owen D. Thomas","Let me just answer the question in the following manner: So in 2008, during the aftermath of the meltdown, we brought our dividend down to our taxable income. And we said, \"That's probably the appropriate level for our dividend to grow at.\" As we look out forward, on a going-concern basis, as I think we've tried to allude to, we're going to have a lot of cash flow growth. And as our cash flow grows, our taxable income is going to go up. And therefore, as a REIT that pays out, effectively, 100% of its taxable income, our dividends are going to grow. We are not doing that artificially, David. So we're not saying, \"Well, we think our dividend should grow by 2.3% a year every year, and we're just sort of using -- establishing that.\" We've established a taxable income metric sort of to move our dividend up, and that's the way we've planned for it. And obviously, with the special dividend that we're doing this year and the reduction in the income that, that caused on a going-forward basis, it's given us a little bit of room.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Is it set for the year, or is that something that could be reviewed by the board during the period of 2014?","Owen D. Thomas","We review the dividend policy and our taxable income with the board a couple of quarters a year, generally as we move towards the middle of the year, and we say, \"Here's where we think our dividend likely will be on a taxable income basis.\" What do we all sort of think about the timing might be for announcing a dividend increase is dependent upon where the taxable income is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Jamie Feldman again with just a quick follow-up. Mike, based on the updated guidance, what are your thoughts on AFFO for 2014?","Michael E. LaBelle","So our AFFO, our FAD has shown pretty good growth. From '12 to '13, it went up like 8%. And as I mentioned, we expect our cash NOI to go up by $60 million, $70 million, I think, I said, so I would expect that our AFFO is going to show a pretty good increase again. I talked about what our occupancy projections were expected to be. So if you kind of look at what our rollover is, we're looking at doing somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million square feet of leasing to achieve those occupancy projections. And I think that our CapEx -- recurring CapEx is going to be somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range. So I think we're at 362 in '13. I would expect it to -- the AFFO to be something like 385 to 395 or something like that in 2014, so a pretty good growth over '13.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Josh Attie from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman, just a quick follow up on just the asset sale program. Maybe Doug or Owen, as I think back to this time last year or even a little bit before that, before you embarked on this most recent round of asset sales, you sort of prepped the market a little bit in terms of sizing, and I'm just curious as it sounds like you're teeing up a number of assets for sale. Where should the market be thinking about both in terms of the suburban asset sales and the more core asset sales, either as a recap in the case of Times Square Tower or just outright sales? I mean, how should we think about the potential size overall of proceeds that your -- that you potentially could generate?","Owen D. Thomas","It's Owen. I don't think we'd be prepared to discuss a size level at this juncture. I would like to just kind of step back for a minute and describe again the philosophy around the asset sales. I think as Doug and I and Mort have been describing, the assets that we've been selecting for sale have really been in 2 categories: One, which Doug was talking about earlier on the call, which is where our views of the growth and the cash flows may be just different from the marketplace. And therefore, we feel that the price that we're able to attract for the asset is very interesting for shareholders over the long term. So that's one category. And then the other category are assets where -- that characteristic may be the case, but also it's in an area that is just nonstrategic for us as a company going forward. So a couple of the suburban assets that we sold at the end of last year were clearly in that category, despite the comments I made earlier about cap rates in the suburban markets. So again, I don't think we'd be prepared to make any specific remarks about sizing at this point. I think the other interesting aspect that you touched on in your question is, are these sales, or are these \"recapitalizations?\" And what we found in the case of Times Square Tower was that we thought the best outcome for us was to do what we did, which is to actually sell only 45% of the asset and retain the leasing and the management. And based on the options that we were considering, we felt that was the best outcome. And as we consider additional monetization activity going forward, that could be also a model.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I guess there's just an element of -- if you have 2 different types of investors, some people that focus on earnings and earnings growth and a large percentage that focus on NAV. These sales and capital-raising activities have been dilutive to current earnings. Arguably, from an NAV perspective, I think they've been enhancing. But from a prepping-the-market perspective, I think we're all just trying to understand the capital side of the equation, both in terms of potential new financings, but also capital raising in the form of asset sales and what that can do, at least, in the near term to earnings, and arguably, over the long-term, they're going to be accretive as you reinvest those proceeds, but just trying to understand those dynamics. And if you think back to what happened last year, it clearly weighed on the stock amongst other things. And that's where I'm just trying to get my arms around, so at least we can be prepped for what may occur.","Owen D. Thomas","Understood.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, I think we appreciate the Q&A and the opportunity to not only explain our general strategy and our general experience these days, but in response to your questions, I think we've tried to give you a more comprehensive and a more detailed analysis of it. There's never a single principle that explains everything that we do because, frankly, the markets change and the interest rates change and the general economic environment changes, and we try and be responsive to it. And we've, I think, shown that we can be responsive to it for as long as we've been a public company, and we intend to continue to do that. But that's all possible because we have a very good interaction with all of you, and we appreciate it, and we look forward to our next conversation after our next quarter. So I thank you, all, very much.","Owen D. Thomas","And Mort, I would just add to what you said. Just to maybe recap a couple of things from the call that are important. We -- as Mike mentioned earlier, we bumped our guidance for 2014 when factoring in the small asset sales that we did in the end of last year. Hopefully, we've been able to demonstrate, I think, very strong leasing momentum in our existing assets and our development pipeline, and I think also we've made great progress over the last quarter identifying a longer-term investment pipeline with some exciting new developments. So again, thank you, all, for your attention and your questions, and we look forward to next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call.

The date for the conference is September 30, and we'll be holding it at our new Hub on Causeway entertainment and office complex in Boston. I'll send out some reminders, but we do look forward to seeing everybody at the conference.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Great. Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We completed another strong quarter of performance which capped off a very successful year at Boston Properties. Specifically, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated FFO per share of $1.87, which is a quarterly record for Boston Properties, and $0.02 above our prior guidance and market consensus. We leased 1.7 million square feet, including significant leases at the GM Building, 399 Park, Reston Town Center, and Colorado Center.","We delivered and placed in service 866,000 square feet of new developments that were 98% pre-leased with an initial cash yield of 7.5%. We increased in-service portfolio occupancy to 93%, which is a 40-basis-point increase over the last quarter and 160 basis point increase over where we were a year ago. We increased our average net rental rates on our second generation leases by 48% for the quarter and 28% for all of 2019.","We increased our regular quarterly dividend 3% to $0.98 per share. Boston Properties has now increased its quarterly dividend by 42% over the past three years, and we increased our growth outlook for 2020 by raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.01. We continue to forecast 8% growth in 2020 following 11% growth in 2019 leading our office peers over the last two years.","In terms of full-year 2019 operational highlights, we completed 7.6 million square feet of in-service asset and development leasing, exceeding 2018 leasing numbers and our second highest level of annual leasing ever. We commenced 908,000 square feet of new developments, including 325 Main Street in Cambridge and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.","We completed new acquisitions for a total of $336 million, including 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham, the remaining 5% interest in our Salesforce Tower development in San Francisco, and land parcels at Carnegie Center in Princeton. We completed approximately $406 million of assets sales versus our goal of $200 million, including the sale of 540 Madison Avenue in New York, Tower Center in East Brunswick, New Jersey; and land parcels in suburban Maryland and Massachusetts.","We also formed a joint venture with CPPIB, which now holds a 45% interest in our Platform 16 development site in San Jose. We raised $2.2 billion in debt financing, including $850 million in green bonds at very attractive interest rates. And once again, we are recognized throughout the year for sustainability, performance, and leadership, earning an eighth consecutive Green Star recognition, ranking among the top 4% of almost 1,000 worldwide participants in the GRESB Assessment and earning ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year from the EPA.","Overall, 2019 was an excellent year from a management, development, leasing, and capital markets perspective. A differentiator for Boston Properties is the depth and strength of our Regional and Corporate Management teams. I am very proud of our entire team at Boston Properties and what we accomplished in 2019 through experience, relationships, teamwork, and commitment to success.","Now, turning to the economic environment. Conditions remain very favorable for our business, and leasing activity is robust in our core markets with few exceptions. Economic growth in the U.S. at around 2.1% projected for 2020 remains high enough to power job creation, space demand, and rent growth, but not high enough to spark inflation and higher interest rates.","The 10-year U.S. treasury remains around 1.6%, 1.7%, and the Fed appears to be on indefinite hold for further rate action. Job creation and inexpensive capital is very constructive for what we do. And in addition, concerns over the geopolitical risks of 2019, particularly trade disputes are currently more tempered creating confidence for business leaders to make investments like new space requirements and for investors to move financial markets positively as we have recently witnessed.","The private capital market for real estate and office assets in our core markets remain healthy. U.S. real estate assets remain an attractive destination for domestic and foreign institutional capital with stable and growing economy, relatively higher yields, and decreasing hedging costs.","Significant office transaction volume in the U.S. ended the fourth quarter up to 24.3% [ph] from the prior quarter and up 3% for all of 2019. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions this past quarter, and I'll cover the largest of which, which were One Marina Park in the Seaport District of Boston sold for a little over $480 million or $918 a square foot and about a 4.6% stabilized cap rate. This little over 0.5 million square foot building is 100% leased and was sold to a domestic real estate investment manager.","And secondly, in New York, 330 Madison Avenue in Midtown East is under agreement to sell for $900 million or $1,060 a square foot and a 4.8% cap rate. This 850,000 square foot property is 95% leased and will be sold to a non-U.S. Insurance Company.","Now moving to Boston Properties capital activities. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders, and we remain active in our pursuit of new projects and value-added redevelopment. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered two successful and accretive projects into service. We completed 145 Broadway, the new 485,000 square foot headquarters for Akamai in Cambridge. The building is 98% leased to Akamai and was delivered on time and budget at an attractive yield.","We also completed the podium phase of our Hub on Causeway development in Boston. This 381,000 square foot project is 97% leased and was also delivered at an attractive yield. The Hub on Causeway podium is the new entrance to the TD Garden and North Station and includes multilevel retail amenities, restaurants, theaters, and other exciting entertainment venues.","Further phases of this development, all of which will be built on top of the podium, include Hub50House, a 440 unit residential tower to be delivered this quarter; 100 Causeway, a 632,000 square foot office tower that is 87% leased and expected to open in 2021; and land under long-term lease to CitizenM, a 269-room, 8-story luxury hotel which was delivered last year.","With these deliveries removed, our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential developments and redevelopments comprising 5.5 million square feet and 3.1 billion of total investment for our share. The commercial component of this portfolio is currently 76% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields on cost are just shy of 7%. Most of the development pipeline is well underway and we have $1.4 billion of equity capital remaining to fund.","In 2020, we anticipate our development pipeline will continue to be dynamic. We plan to deliver 6 projects, representing 2 million square feet and $1.1 billion of investment, including 1750 President Street, 159 East 53rd Street, Dock 72, 20 CityPoint, Hub50House and Skyline. We are already recognizing a portion of the income expected from most of these projects.","As replacement for these deliveries, we expect to begin the first phases of 4th and Harrison in San Francisco and Platform 16 in San Jose. 4th and Harrison received 505,000 square feet of Prop M allocation in the fourth quarter of 2019 that will allow us to begin construction in 2020. And site enablement work is underway at Platform 16.","The first phases of these future developments totaled $935,000, approximately $1 billion in new investment. With our current pipeline of deliveries and these new potential starts, our development pipeline at year-end 2020 could be approximately 8 projects comprising 4.4 million square feet and $3 billion of investment.","And for beyond 2020, we have a 13 million square foot land bank under control which should lead to additional development opportunities. Near-term prospects in this portfolio include 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York, 25% owned by us, 171 Dartmouth Street adjacent to the Back Bay Station in Boston and CityPoint in Waltham, for all of which we are pursuing anchor tenants before commencing vertical development. In addition, we have another phase of significant residential development at Reston Town Center.","Moving to acquisitions and dispositions. We are under contract subject to due diligence for the sale of New Dominion Technology Park for in excess of $250 million that we believe will close this quarter. The property comprises 493,000 square feet lease to the Federal Government in two buildings located in Northern Virginia. We recently extended the current government tenancy for 15 years at flat rent making the property a strong disposition candidate. We anticipate completing a like-kind exchange for this asset and retaining all proceeds for other investments.","We also just completed a joint venture with Alexandria Real Estate Equities for our Gateway Commons portfolio in South San Francisco. This joint venture where both parties will have approximately a 50% ownership when fully funded will be formed with Boston Properties contributing three existing office buildings totaling 768,000 square feet and Alexandria contributing three adjacent buildings including a newly constructed amenity center totaling 313,000 square feet.","The critical value creation for Boston Properties and Alexandria with the joint venture is that both parties will contribute land, including a parcel owned by us and encumbered with surface parking by Alexandria, and excess structured parking associated with the existing buildings, creating three sites totaling a minimum of 640,000 square feet of potential development for lab and office use.","Upon completion of the development plan, the joint venture will comprise a significant critical mass of 1.7 million square feet of office and life science space in a premier location in one of the strongest life science markets in the U.S.","So in summary, 2019 was a very successful year for Boston Properties. We executed well on our growth plan, driven by the lease up of in-service properties and external growth driven by development. Given our leading property market positioning, constructive market conditions, growing new investment pipeline and a team eager to produce, we are very excited for 2020 and beyond.","Let me turn it over to Doug.","Douglas Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. We're not going to say that anymore. It should be pretty clear from Owen's macro commentary that we are feeling really good, very positive about the state of the business economy. And the overall daily transactional leasing activity that we're experiencing across our portfolio really is in lockstep and as you heard during the last 12 months we increased our in-service occupancy by more than 160 basis points, so strong leasing volumes everywhere.","You shouldn't interpret this though to mean that every market is strong. We have our strong markets, which are characterized by tight supply and very modest short-term new deliveries, Boston, Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, San Francisco CBD and West LA, and there we have rental economics that continue to grow and grow significantly, strongly.","We operate in the second group of markets, which have higher availability, consistent new construction deliveries, i.e. less supply constraints, but that are coupled with very significant technology demand, so the Silicon Valley, the Reston Town Center area, the new construction on the far West side of Manhattan.","These markets are improving. So it's more of a function of the premium of new product being added to the market as opposed to a simple market conditions. The third segment is the Plaza District in Manhattan. It behaves differently since it lacks the technology demand growth.","We continue to have strong activity from non-tech users. Obviously they have more modest growth, although we had two deals this quarter, which were expansions from non-tech users. And we'll talk about those in a few minutes. But there does remain significant supply and there really hasn't been much in the way of changes in the economics over the last year or two. And then the fourth category really is limited and in our portfolio to DC CBD, which both has supply and demand headwinds, the best buildings continue to have leasing activity, but the market concessions are at an elevated level.","Our primary customer, large real estate users with a private or public startup or established, continue to make decisions to upgrade and consolidate their space and in many cases expand as they use their space in the competition for talent, which is the key to our business. Even in our most expensive markets, we see very few tenants taking actions that reflect looming concerns about their business prospects.","A case in point, we're in discussions with a service firm in San Francisco that is currently located in the base of one of our AC buildings. The tenant is negotiating to move to the top of the building where the rent will be 25% higher that's on a renewal in one site versus the other and they will have to come out of pocket over a $100 a square foot to build their new improvements and their square footage isn't changing a bit.","Let's talk about the markets now. Our expectations and what's going on in our portfolio. Let me begin with New York City. The significant technology, tenant leasing in Manhattan that was completed over the last few months was very much in line with market rumors and expectations. There really weren't any surprises. It's great since it represents lots of growth and absorption and practically speaking, we think it may accelerate the timing of 3 Hudson Boulevard, since there are fewer new construction options with large space block opportunities.","The two law firm leases in the new developments that were announced will lead to availability and existing products. So we are optimistic. While we're optimistic about the shrinking availability of the newly constructed space, we will continue to have a cautious view of transaction economics over the next two years.","That being said, leasing volume is very strong. Last quarter, we completed a 20-year lease renewal at 599 Lexington Avenue with Shearman & Sterling, our anchor tenant starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338,000 square feet. We've now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140,000 square feet. That was due to expire through 2024 and the reason I use a 140,000 square feet is we have a tenant that looks to be moving into one of the new developments in our 601 Lexington Avenue development in 2022.","We have signed leases on three of the four available floors at 399 Park Avenue and are negotiating a lease on the remaining floor. As a barometer of market conditions, these leases on these four floors have average starting rent of about a $100 a square foot and market level rent bumps, TIs and free rent.","The expiry win on the floors was about $107 a square foot. We would have done a similar deal in 2018 or 2019. In addition, we signed a renewal and expansion as a base for 80,000 square feet and we are negotiating an expansion for one of the tower floors that we're going to get back in 2021, so again, very strong leasing activity.","At the General Motors Building, since the completion of the Plaza work in the opening of the Apple cube in September, we've completed 140,000 square feet of office leasing, including a new tenant on a vacant floor full floor and the upper portion of the building, a long-term expansion and to short-term renewal. CBRE reports that the City saw more than 2.1 million square feet of relocation deals with starting rents over $120 a square foot and 1.2 million a relocation deals with starting rents between a $100 and $119.","So that's 3.3 million square feet and that versus 2.5 million square feet in 2018. So we are encouraged by the level of activity at the high-end in the market and at our building. We also completed the lease on the available 6,600 square feet of Fifth Avenue retail space for a retailer that is planning to remodel an existing Madison Avenue store. And we did a 7,500 square foot renewal with our for our 2021 expiration on Madison Avenue retail.","Switching to Washington D.C., the CBD continues to have, as I said, the most challenging market conditions amongst our reasons that would only represent 6% of our NOI. This quarter, we completed a 76,000 square foot, 10-year renewal at 2200 Pen for lease it was expected to expire in 2021. The current rent, which has been escalating for 2.5% for a decade is going to roll down about 18%. Give you a sense of the conditions in DC.","Northern Virginia, we're 9% of our company NOI originates and where we are developing continues to have significant tenant demand growth. The same technology companies that are growing in San Francisco and in Boston and in New York City are also expanding in Northern Virginia as they both service the U.S. Government and search for the highest quality labor markets.","We believe that the $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract will create significant office demand in Northern Virginia. There is still significant vacancy in the market, but the urban core in Reston continues to outperform with starting rents in the high-40s to low-50s.","This quarter, we completed 438,000 square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center including 75,000 square feet for Facebook, a 312,000 square foot renewal with Bechtel and 11 smaller deals. We are in lease renewal and relocation negotiations with another 135,000 square foot tenant. The 270,000 square feet of Leidos relocation and expansion, the 1750 is expected to occur by the end of April.","So they're going to vacate one, two freedom square, so we'll still have some work to do, filling our 500,000 square feet of availability in Reston, but we are in active discussions with tenants that could fill significant portions of that space and most recently we entered into a dialogue, aka a lease negotiation with a tenant with a 2023 to 2024 occupancy requirement that is interested in a significant portion of the availability at RTC Next. That's the building that's under construction for Fannie Mae, so really strong activity in Reston.","Switching to the West Coast. The story in San Francisco CBD is a lack of availability in 2020 through 2022 and the meaningful increase in asking and taking rents that has occurred. The vacancy rate is at an all time, lowest level since the last cycle began after the great financial crisis. There's about 3.5 million square feet of either under construction or announced and permitted projects with delivery beginning no earlier than late 2022 and more than 1.6 million square feet is either in lease negotiation or leased","With our Prop M allocation in hand, we are moving towards the purchase of the land to develop Fourth and Harrison, and we could start construction in late 2020 for an early 2023 delivery tenant conversations have begun. There are additional permitted potential development in 2024 and beyond.","New construction rents are approaching over a $100 a square foot, triple net, on all this new development. New to the market or about 700,000 of sublet opportunities stemming from Uber's anticipated move to Mission Bay, so perhaps there'll be a little bit early for tenants. Our San Francisco CBD portfolio ended the quarter at 97.2% occupied and 98% committed. With little availability, we had one of the quietest quarters I can remember with only 24,000 square feet of CBD leasing.","In 2020, we have very limited availability, so our focus today is 2021 and 2022 expirations. Based on current market fundamentals, we continue to believe that we will realize double-digit rental increases as we relet space. As an example, we just recaptured a floor at 680 Folsom Street that was leased in 2015. The terminated lease which had 3% annual bumps, had a mark-to-market in 2020, even after five years of escalations of almost 20%, so the market rents continue to grow.","In the Silicon Valley, we have our Mountain View assets and a portfolio of great development opportunities. This market continues to experience strong growth led by Google, which leased another 475,000 square feet during the quarter and the market had record setting absorption in 2019.","In our existing Mountain View portfolio, we continue to release and renew space at rents in excess of $55 triple net. This quarter we completed two leases totaling 52,000 square feet with an average rental increase of 65%. In 2020, our most significant opportunity in the Bay Area is in the Mountain View portfolio, where we will have about 150,000 square feet of availability.","Owen mentioned Platform 16 and our opportunity in San Jose. It's been quite clear that as the technology companies continue to grow, their employees commit to work is becoming a critical factor in their recruitment and retention. We've seen companies like Facebook and Google expand in San Francisco as they provide an alternative location for employees that may spend three plus hours a day on a private bus.","And likewise, Uber and Splunk and Twitter and Airbnb have all expanded down into the Silicon Valley for similar reasons. We have seen a distinct premium for those Valley and peninsula office assets that are in close proximity to the Caltrain stops and particularly the bullet locations.","Platform 16 and the Plaza at Almaden our other development are less than one mile from the Diridon Caltrain bullet stop as well as future BART connections. I think the last owner-occupied new construction in downtown San Jose was in 2009, 11 years ago and it was based on a set of plans that was drawn in 1987.","We believe downtown San Jose, [indiscernible] significant growth and as you read in the Wall Street Journal this morning, it's clearly coming. But last but not least, we're going to get to Boston. The CBD, Cambridge and Waltham-Lexington continue to be the beneficiaries of ongoing growth in the technology and life science sectors and significant immigration from the outer suburban market and corporate relocation. As the Boston region comprises more than one-third of our NOI, we are benefiting from this growth in a big way.","Similar to San Francisco, there is very little available space in large blocks in the Boston CBD. There are multiple buildings under construction in Boston, which will deliver in late 2022 and 2023 with some current availability and there are active plans for new construction, including has Owen suggested our permitted project at 171 Dartmouth Street.","That's the Back Bay station site, which will create additional supply in 2023 and beyond to meet demand. And an interesting twist, many of the new buildings are being designed for life science users as the availability in Cambridge has all been disappeared.","Our CBD portfolio is 99% leased today and we continue to complete forward leasing transactions. During the quarter, we did about 200,000 square feet, including 72,000 square feet at The Hub on Causeway, as Owen talked about. In addition, at 200 Clarendon, we continued to get early renewals and expansions. We completed over 114,000 square feet of leases with an average increase of rents of 30%.","In Cambridge, 145 Broadway, 485,000 square foot building leased to Akamai is open. And to put the strength of the Cambridge office market in perspective, if the Akamai lease, which was negotiated in 2016, were to roll to market today, the mark-to-market would be over 50%, four years. There continues to be significant demand in the Waltham-Lexington suburban market, which is where we have our largest availability in the region in 2020.","Our 200 West Street project, which is actively being converted to lab use, will be ready for tenant build out in the third quarter. We will continue to expand our potential tenant universe in Waltham to include lab requirements. New construction office rents in this market are in the mid-40s triple net and lab rents are pushing through $60 triple net. Our 180 CityPoint project is permitted and in a position to start with either a lab or an office installation.","I'll conclude with a comment about the Prudential Center observatory. Later this year, we expect to commence on major repositioning of the 50 to 52nd floors of the Prudential Tower. We anticipate spending in excess of $125 million, creating an extraordinary experience for local area residents and visitors to Boston, expect an initial return on this capital investment including forgone income from this space, which is part of our 2020 guidance in line with our recent development project, and we hope to open this public facility in mid-2022.","With that, Mike has some comments about the fourth quarter results and 2020 FFO.","Michael LaBelle","Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning. As Owen described, we had a really strong year in 2019. In addition to our 11% FFO growth, we demonstrated substantial revenue growth of 9% and the growth came organically from higher occupancy and higher rents in the same-property portfolio as well as externally from the delivery of developments.","Our share of 2019 same-property NOI growth ended the year higher by 5.4% over full-year 2018, and it was even higher on a cash basis at 6.7% growth. We also had an incremental $78 million in NOI from our developments, contributing 6.5% to our growth. And we still have an active pipeline of $3.1 billion in developments under construction that are projected to provide incremental earnings growth every year for the next several years.","Turning to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We reported funds from operation of $1.87 per share and that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The increase was primarily from improved portfolio revenues due to a combination of leases commencing earlier than projected as well as better than projected service income from our tenants in the quarter.","Our results would have been $0.01 stronger, had we not incurred a $1.5 million charge from extinguishment of debt. We elected to prepay a $26.5 million mortgage, encumbering our New Dominion property. The loan carried a high interest rate of 7.69% and the repayment is reflected in our lower interest expense assumptions for 2020.","Looking ahead to 2020, we have updated our FFO guidance with changes primarily coming from our pending asset sale and changes in our interest expense assumptions. Our portfolio NOI assumptions remain in line with last quarter's guidance. Doug detailed the solid leasing activity we're seeing in the majority of our markets, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver ongoing same-property growth.","Our assumptions for 2020 includes same-property NOI growth of between 3% and 4.75%, and incremental growth from our non-same properties primarily our development deliveries of $60 million to $70 million. As Owen described, we have New Dominion under contract per sale and we expect diligence to be completed and the sale to close in the first quarter. The sale results in a significant gain.","We plan to complete a lifetime exchange with 880, 890 Winter Street that we acquired in 2019 and the acquisition of the land under our 4th and Harrison development in San Francisco that is currently under option. These exchanges allow us to retain the sale proceeds for reinvestment in higher growth developments. The projected earnings impact of the sale, net of interest earned on the proceeds is $0.04 per share of FFO dilution compared to our prior guidance. The other change in our assumptions relates to reduced interest expense.","We now anticipate that we will commence construction this year on the first phases of both our Platform 16 development in San Jose and our 4th and Harrison development in San Francisco. The associated capitalized interest for these developments reduces our interest expense assumptions.","Also contributing to the reduced interest expense are the repayment of the New Dominion mortgage and lower interest rates overall. The combination of these items lowers our assumption for net interest expense by approximately $15 million at the midpoint, and our new range is $395 million to $415 million for 2020.","So we are increasing our guidance for 2020 funds from operation by $0.01 per share at the midpoint, despite the projected dilution of $0.04 per share from asset sales. Our revised guidance range is $7.47 to $7.65 per share. So excluding the asset sale, we would have increased our guidance by $0.05 per share. All of this points to continuing our strong earnings growth rate with 11% FFO growth in 2019 followed up by projected 8% FFO growth in 2020 at the midpoint.","Our 2020 growth will be driven by strong topline revenue growth from increasing rental rates in our existing portfolio and the delivery of profitable developments from our pipeline. ","We have a robust $3.1 billion development pipeline under construction with the commercial space currently 76% pre-leased. This plus the expected additions of Platform 16 and 4th and Harrison later this year position us well to deliver continued multi-year growth.","That's all we have for our formal remarks. I think the operator will now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. ","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Good morning, everyone. I guess, starting out with the new joint venture in South San Francisco, clearly, a very strong market. Can you just give us a feel for how this is going to work in terms of redeveloping existing buildings versus doing new development? And if there's any \u2013 I know you're going through the plans still, but is there any early indications of how we should think about cost per square foot incrementally to build this out along with rents, you think, you can get in the market today?","Owen Thomas","Nick, let me start off. I'm sure Doug will have a few comments as well. So just to back up for a second and talk a little bit about our rationale for doing this joint venture. Gateway is a very well located office park near Transit in South San Francisco, which is a very strong lab market and frankly a less strong office market. The keys that drove the joint venture is there is a land parcel that is located between our assets and Alexandria's assets that are part of this joint venture.","And that land is owned by us, but it's encumbered by a surface parking easement by one of the Alexandria buildings. So by doing this joint venture, both we and Alexandria are contributing our rights to that site, and we can develop on it. So this JV opens up that parcel to new development, and we and Alexandria also contributed additional sites. And also on the Boston Properties side, we have some excess parking that we can contribute to as well.","So the way we look at this is from our standpoint, and I do think Alexandria, this is one plus one equals three. We're creating value just by putting the two sides together. Also from our standpoint, we get to reorient our investment in Gateway, which is primarily an office project to date, to the lab market locally, which is much stronger. We free up 3 new development opportunities. We have no loss of income. So again, I think this is a win-win for both Boston Properties and Alexandria.","As it relates to some of your questions about the development, the total development rights as I mentioned and it\u2019s mentioned in the release and in my remarks is over 600,000 feet. It's on three separate sites. We and Alexandria are \u2013 will -- have been and will be working on development plans for those sites. So we're not prepared at this point to answer some of your questions as it relates to cost. There is a possibility that we could launch one of these buildings in this year. So not all of them, but one of them.","Douglas Linde","Yes. I would just add a couple of more \u2013 just clarifying comments. So the current portfolio is our three office buildings, an office building that Alexandria owns, a lab building that Alexandria owned, and an amenity building. So think of it this way, right now, we're 100% office, and as of the formation of transaction, we\u2019re \u2013 have about 13% lab, so we've reduced our office exposure. And assuming we build all the lab buildings, and we do some conversion of some of the existing assets, we're probably going to be somewhere closer to 50% or 60% lab in this marketplace at the end of the day.","Right now, I think we contemplate that the buildings that will be developed will be lab buildings. They're all sort of in a couple hundred thousand square feet range. And we are actually \u2013 there's a plan that we've agreed to for the first building and we're hopeful that we're going to be in a position to have gotten our permits pulled and start construction on that building by the latter part of 2020.","And with regards to market rents, I think our view of market rents is that the lab rents are in the mid-50s plus or minus. And so we try to achieve a 7% return on cost, and I think Alexandria has the same perspective, and so that can sort of give you a sense of where we think new construction will be.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of the 50-50 nature of the venture, are we to assume that the contributions are roughly equal? So any future spend would be split 50-50?","Owen Thomas","The value of what we're contributing is slightly more than the value of what Alexandria is contributing. So the venture is starting off with us owning a little bit more than 50%. And as we proceed with new development, Alexandria will be funding all of it until it's trued up to 50-50.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Just one last question on GM Building. I was just hoping to get an update. I know you've got some leasing done in the quarter. But in terms of the leasing prospects for the remaining vacancy there as well as the upcoming lease expirations and \u2013 as well there was \u2013 there's been some reports about Perella Weinberg, which has a lease for, I think, 130,000 square feet in the building expiring in early 2022. There've been some reports about them being courted for some other redevelopments in the city. How are the renewal prospects looking for that along with the rest of the leasing you're trying to do right now? Thanks.","Owen Thomas","John Powers, do you want to take that one.","John Powers","Yes. We think Perella will leave. We tried to keep them. We worked on that very hard, but for a number of reasons and restacking in place is always difficult. And I think that they will leave the building. We are talking right now to a couple of tenants for that space. I don't know if we'll make that deal \u2013 those deals, and we have space rolling up. But as Doug said, we had a pretty good quarter at the end of the year, and I'm pretty optimistic. I think we will be moving forward with some amenity space in the building, which will also be a plus.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys. The $12 million increase in NOI loss from dispositions. Is that all Dominion? Or is there \u2013 there's no leakage from the JV contribution?","Owen Thomas","No, not at all, it's a 100% New Dominion. Obviously that's not a net number, right. That's just a gross number.","Craig Mailman","Right. So what \u2013 depending on what timing you guys have in there, what was the cap rate on New Dominion?","Owen Thomas","We're not going to talk about that. It's not a closed deal.","Craig Mailman","Okay. And then just you guys have talked about 3 Hudson maybe kicking off sooner than expected. I mean, what kind of interest are you guys getting now that a lot of other new supply is being absorbed? And what timing do you think realistically could be accelerated, too?","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to answer that one?","John Powers","Thanks, Owen. Yes, we're pretty optimistic based on the tenant response first of all to the building that we\u2019ve received, very positive response. The building, of course, it's on a full acre and it has avenues on three sides. So it's a great site. And we've designed a building that's pretty designed. We're in 100% CDs now. So we've shown it to a lot of brokers, but we've made probably a dozen tenant presentations and it's been very, very well received. So based on that we're still rolling with the foundation, the foundation is not quite complete yet.","Obviously, we will not go forward without an anchor tenant. We have a stream of tenants that are interested. Some have \u2013 we can make a 24 lease expiration date. That would be the earliest that we could make. Some of the deals that have been done that have been announced, those tenants met with us. I think everyone of them like the building, but we could not make the earlier dates that they really want it.","So we have also some tenants with later dates. We're talking to some 25s, 26s, even 27s. So I think what we've decided now is we have the building that we want to build. We have the foundations. And so this is going to be a win not if and we have to just see how it goes over the next quarter or two quarters to see whether we just continue and go forward or we slow down the construction process.","Craig Mailman","Great. And just one last one, I know we had talked previously about land site in Dallas. Is that still kicking around? Where are you guys on that?","Owen Thomas","We are not looking at different sites all the time. And so we continue to think about Northern Virginia as a really important focus for our growth. And so we don't have anything that we can comment on specifically, but we continue to look at different assets.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Billerman here with Manny. Doug, in your opening comments, you talked about the three other pre-development project, 3 Hudson yards, which John just talked about Waltham and Back Bay. I guess if you had to think about the probability of one or more of those projects starting this year, I guess how would you rank them? And how much of it is tenant demand driven versus the rent and the returns that you require in getting those projects off the ground? Right because I assume it's part of both, right? You need the tenants to show up, but then you need them to pay the rents that you want for your shareholders to earn the returns that they thought?","Douglas Linde","Yes. So I would answer the question in the following way Michael. So we are actively engaged in conversations with tenants, as John said, at 3 Hudson Boulevard, and we are also actively engaged with tenants on conversations on both 171 Dartmouth Street and on 180 CityPoint. We don't have a signed letter of intent with anyone yet. So I don't think we're in a position where we're close to announcing something.","The rents that we are asking are, I would say commensurate with where the market is today and they are more than satisfactory to provide us with an acceptable return to start those buildings. So if you force me to push from a timing perspective, I think that the 171 Dartmouth Street building is probably the one where we have the most significant conversation with tenants who we know are going to want to make a move from where they currently are or expand in the City. And so I said that's probably the one of the three that's most likely.","Michael Bilerman","Okay.","Bryan Koop","This is Bryan Koop. Some additional color would be as we ended last year with the completion of leasing, let's say for the Hub, which was our major exposure on the urban side. We're thrilled with our position on our development pipeline from the standpoint of our basis as well, because when you look at the recent sales of land at record numbers, we couldn't be more thrilled with our position in this late cycle with both the Back Bay Station and also Waltham with some of the new sites that have been delivered up for sale at exceeding $500 of buildable foot. And then you compound that with them 6% increases in construction costs over the last five years. We couldn't be happy about our position with these development sites that Doug mentioned.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Well, thank you for that Koop. And then the second question, I mean Owen or Doug. Can you take us a little bit behind the curtain on the joint venture with Alexandria, sort of when your discussion started? And also you have a lot of overlap in some of your other core markets. You think about holdings in Cambridge or in San Francisco.","Have your conversations expanded to see other ways that you can have a one plus one equal greater than two, between your two organizations that do have very similar philosophies to capital allocation to development, to management and all of those sorts of things?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So Michael, its Owen. We initiated these conversations with Alexandria last year and the reason we initiated it was for the rationale that I went through earlier, the one plus one equals three, reorienting our investment in gateway from office to lab. No loss of income, and also I think not only win for us, but also a win for Alexandria. So we initiated it. We just got to close as you know. We have and hope to continue to have a strong relationship with Alexandria, but there's no additional dialogue with them at this time about other joint ventures or other cooperation.","Michael Bilerman","Did you discuss at all just selling outright your holdings to them or them selling their holdings to you?","Owen Thomas","Our preference was to do the deal that we've currently constructed. We think that's a better outcome for Boston Properties shareholders in selling the Park. Because it's all, as I mentioned earlier, it's all office. It's in a strong lab market. We think will create more value for our shareholders by doing the joint venture as currently constructed than we would if we sold it for cash.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America Securities.","James Feldman","Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the JV. Can you talk about who's going to be managing construction and then managing the assets?","Owen Thomas","So the joint venture will be jointly controlled from a governance standpoint. Alexandria will be the property manager, although we will receive a portion of the fees. We and Alexandria will be co-developers, though Alexandria will be in the lead and we will also receive a portion of those fees and we think this structure makes sense, given the larger presence that Alexandria has in the South San Francisco market.","James Feldman","Okay. And it sounds like there's an amenity building that's now going to be included in your joint portfolio in the gateway. I mean, what kind of value do you think that adds to your holdings in that submarket?","Douglas Linde","So this is Doug, Jamie. We think it holds a lot of value, which is why we did the transaction. So we have three buildings of almost 700,000 square feet that are currently office buildings and are pretty de minimis amount of amenities. And we saw that Alexandria is building, was building 17,000 square foot, high quality first-class amenities building with a significant advantage from a leasing perspective with regards to both office and the lab tenants that are in that marketplace.","So we really \u2013 this was truly an opportunity where the two organizations looked at their assets in this particular submarket and said, we're much better off operating. This is one collective as opposed to us sort of doing our own separate things and not being able to untie this piece of land where we owned it and they had an easement on it and where we had extra parking and other assets, and where they had an amenity building. So you throw all this stuff together and it's a win-win for all the customers in both locations today and in the future.","James Feldman","All right, thanks. And then Owen I want to go back to some of your comments at the beginning of the call. I guess starting out, maybe just your thoughts on capital flows. You had talked about hedging costs, maybe a potential increase in foreign capital. Just as you look at the office business or office assets that have been kind of slow to trade in the last few years. Do you see a meaningful pickup? And if so, kind of what markets and what types of assets, whether it's core value, add opportunistic, just anything you think may change here.","Owen Thomas","Yes. So I just look at the numbers, the transaction volume for our space, those being larger office buildings was a little bit up in 2019 versus 2018. But I think the market is very solid, there's good liquidity. I look at things like interest rates are going down, and cap rates are at least so far have not, so that spread between where the cap rates are and the risk free rate is very healthy, from a liquidity standpoint.","I think there is a lot of liquidity in the world is looking for real estate. And I think the U.S. is a very strong destination, given that even though our \u2013 we look at our rates as being low, they're lower in most of the other developed countries and cap rates are even lower. So there's yield available here, there's stability available here, and I'm optimistic for capital flows going into 2020.","In terms of the markets, I do think there is a higher level of liquidity for the tech and life science sectors of the private capital market. So I think competitions for buildings that are in Boston or in San Francisco or in West LA are stronger I think in general than they are in New York for example.","James Feldman","Okay. We've heard about the pushback on just people getting their heads around CapEx costs. When it comes to office, do you think that that tone has changed at all or that's going to be persistent?","Owen Thomas","I don't know if it's changed. That's certainly a focus on the private market as well. But again, every quarter, and I did a couple more this quarter, the cap rates haven't changed much. I mean I've been giving, on these calls, a pretty robust report on the private capital market for Class A office buildings in our core markets, and the cap rates have been sticking more or less in the force. So I think CapEx is always something that's discussed for office and frankly for all types of real estate. But I don't think it's had a material impact on the cap rates.","James Feldman","Okay. And then just finally, you would also commented that business conditions and business confidence seem better today than heading into 2019, given some of the global risks at the time you? We saw a lot of tech leasing last year. Do you think this is going to spread to other sectors where you could see, major large expansions from other sectors into some of these markets? Or do you think it will still be mostly tech that's taking down most of the space?","Owen Thomas","Yes. I think that tech and life science and other creative industries will continue to be the drivers of net absorption. I think the more traditional industries, financial customers, legal customers, their businesses are fine. They're doing well. I don't see as much growth in those areas. So I think you'll see them, there will be lease expiration driven leasing. And I think many of these employers will also be seeking to upgrade their space, but I'm not sure they're going to necessarily grow substantially.","James Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Owen Thomas","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Hi, everyone. Doug, do you believe the technology company demands, you mentioned in New York City, actually has some runway and could it potentially continue at this pace or potentially even accelerate?","Douglas Linde","So, Derek, I would answer the question in the following way. I believe that that New York City as a physical location for the kind of workers that the technology companies are looking for will continue to be very attractive. It has relatively speaking the best transportation system in all of the major metropolitan markets and it has got affordable and reasonable housing prices within great easy proximity to where companies are locating.","And those two things, in my opinion, are very important determinants for where the technology companies are looking to expand their workforce. Plus, they obviously have a lot of college educated workers. So I do believe that New York City has a lot of leg under it, and on a long-term basis, will be a market where the technology companies will continue to grow and prosper.","Derek Johnston","Okay. Great guys. That's it for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI.","Jason Green","Good morning. Split role in California has been a topic that's gained a lot of traction to start the year. Just curious if you're able to share your thoughts on the probability of passage and also the impact it would have on your portfolio?","Owen Thomas","So I'll talk about what the impact on the portfolio will be. And I'm going to let Bob Pester talk about the \"probability of passage.\" So the way we look at this is that we have triple net leases and we have gross leases.","In a strong market, you can very easily make the argument that well, but triple net lease escalation of taxes will get pushed along to the tenants, and with the gross leases, the escalation to the tenants, that's not rolling, we'll get passed along. But to the extent that you're resetting base years on gross leases.","The question will be, how will that impact your net? And if it's a really strong market, you probably could choose to move those gross leases to net leases and sort of continue that \"path\u201d along with your other portfolio.","The thing about this split tax is that it's very unclear as how the reassessments will occur? How long it will take? How they're going to do it? How much \"annual escalation\" there will be in the assessments will be every three years that they get to you? Will it be on an annual basis? How many years will take for them to actually start the reassessment process? So all that stuff is very, very much in FLEX.","If you said to us, okay, well assuming everything had to get reassessed and assuming you were able to continue to pass along all of your triple net escalation to the tenants, but on your gross leases, you had to demonstrate what the impact was. We would tell you it's probably somewhere between $0.02 and $0.03 a share on our portfolio. And it would take our average lease length is a year or so, it would take eight years for that to roll through.","Bob, do you want to talk about the probability of the split role taxing?","Robert Pester","Sure. I think the jury is still out on how this is going to turn out, although I believe current polling showing that it doesn't pass. And then there's the issue is this just the first step of them trying to raise property taxes, not just on commercial properties, but then having a second phase that hits residential, which I think is a nonstarter for anyone that owns a house in California, but this will play out over the next six to nine months, and we'll have a better feel during that time. But at present time, I don't think it's going to pass.","Jason Green","Got it. And then I guess just a follow-up, just given the votes getting closer, have you seen any change in asset pricing or transaction activity in California just relative to this acts being on the ballot?","Robert Pester","I have not.","Owen Thomas","And remember that when a new building is sold, it gets assessed to market. So unless there were some odd structure about the way the sale was going to occur, everyone would assume that the assessment would change. And I don't think people are viewing the building escalations after the assessment to have a material impact on the value on a going forward basis.","Robert Pester","And that's not a change. So I guess \u2013 it's always been that way. They always get reassessed on purchase, so that's always been kind of baked into the \u2013 in those assets.","Jason Green","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning up there. So two questions from us. So first one, just on the Shearman & Sterling renewal, can you just talk about what played into that? Maybe every partner there commutes in and out of Grand Central. But can you talk about the things that you were able to do to keep them in that building versus some of the other major law firms that chose and other major tenants that chose to go to new construction? So I don't know if they're restocking in place, but maybe, I don't know if there are particular things or if it was just general, they just \u2013 they like where they office, they weren't interested in relocating to a different submarket. Just curious.","Douglas Linde","So I'll just make one quick comment and then I'll let John describe the negotiation. We were really good at what we do, Alex. And so tenants like it to be in our buildings. I just make that as sort of a visceral reaction to that. But John, do you want to talk about\u2026?","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you, Doug. I appreciate it. I would expect nothing less from you.","Douglas Linde","John?","John Powers","Maybe I'll be a little more specific. Yes. I think they were intending to leave. I think they were going to leave. And I have lunch. We've kept in touch with them, but I have lunch with the Chief Operating Officer there and he gave me a list of all the things that were forcing them to leave. And then we took that list one by one and we responded to it and we found swing space for them in the building.","We made a deal with Citibank across the street to move \u2013 to get their conference center. So that would be available. It's very hard to rebuild a conference center, pay for that, and then move back into a conference center. So Citibank has downsized as everyone knows here in the corner. And they were ready to do something different with that conference center.","So we made a deal with a firm in London to sublease it from Citibank. And then we made a deal with the firm that sublease did to allow Shearman to use it for a year. So they go across the street to rebuild their conference center. So the swing space, the conference center, they had some operational issues in the building because it was a \u2013 these weren't really built based building problems, but they were problems that stem from the way they did.","They build a way, way back in the late 1980s, and we were able to get them to understand how that all happened from an MEP standpoint and they were very comfortable that we\u2019re going to fix it all. So given you a high point of a number of things on a much longer list, but when we had all that done, they decided when they looked at their alternatives that they could live here happily for another 20 years, which will by the way make it 50 years at the end of that 20 that they'll be in this asset.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you. And then second question is, I was talking to a broker recently in one of the life science markets. And the point came up about the political rhetoric that it was on the campaign trail and healthcare and all that fun stuff.","And the question is, if it's having any impact on life science leasing. So are you seeing any life science tenants maybe starting to dial back their thoughts on taking space based on what may happen in the election or in healthcare legislation? Or is all that rhetoric not having any impact in life science continues to go full bore?","Douglas Linde","So our venue on life science is primarily in the greater Boston market because that's where our life science assets are. And I would tell you that, our view is that interestingly enough, there are more life science tenants looking for space today than there ever have been.","And many of those same life science centers are actually, if you will, warehousing space because they're concerned about finding space as they grow. So we have not seen any of the rhetoric translate into a visceral reaction that we should slow down or stop what we're doing because our business models are going to somehow be stressed by what goes on from a political perspective.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Douglas Linde","We haven't also seen any slow down in the investment portion of the life sciences. We had a record number of VC investment last year. I think it was one out of every $4 in VC came to the Boston market. We continue to see that. And then we also continue to see several of our clients have a pipeline of, call it, new drugs that are up for approval, which have a tremendous amount of opportunity. So we haven't seen any of the rhetoric translate into demand.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. So just two quick ones. One, can you all sort of rework and maybe just a bit of a slowing down in base here in New York and maybe some other markets. Just give us some updated thoughts on how you see BXP, FLEX evolving? And just maybe broader thoughts or specific thoughts around on plans for the makeready suites that you've referenced in the past?","Owen Thomas","Yes. Okay. So maybe I'll make a general comment on the whole shared workspace business. I'll turn it over to Bryan to talk about FLEX by BXP. Clearly there's been a slow down in new leasing from the Coworking operators, given all of the tumult with WeWork last year. And I think that's not only been true of WeWork, but also some of the smaller operators. I mean, I think the markets continue to be healthy \u2013 ending that demand driver has gone away at least for the beginning of 2020.","Bryan Koop","Yes. This is Bryan Koop. If you look at our strategy with FLEX in Boston, it's really been almost complimentary to our existing products. So as an example with The Hub on Causeway, we have one full floor that we had always planned on putting into podium and that's 100% pre-leased and opened last week. And we're just thrilled with the product and how it came out.","By year-end we hope to have four locations, but it's really complimentary to our existing assets and has nothing to do with what's taking place in the greater market. And then in a greater market on Coworking, I think our FLEX product has been immune from, call it, a lot of the noise because the FLEX product is really for the small-to-medium enterprise, and it's not a Coworking product per se. It's a Space as a Service for small-to-medium enterprises.","Owen Thomas","Yes. So we look at it as, we're not trying to grow FLEX for the sake of growth. But if we have \u2013 we do think the product is interesting to a segment of our customer base and if we have the right space in the right place, we'll consider future stores.","Douglas Linde","The only other places that we're currently in processes in San Francisco or that we actually got back in November and it's under way to be a floor of a similar ilk in San Francisco.","Vikram Malhotra","Great. And then just the JV with Alexandria that\u2019s definitely interesting. Thanks for all the color. This seems like a very specific deal on a specific opportunity, but just curious as you step back and look at sort of your holdings on the East Coast as well, do you think there are opportunities kind of to partner with whether it's private capital or other firms sort of more in a joint venture basis given sort of maybe where we are in the cycle?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So to answer you, let me \u2013 I think you asked kind of two questions there. Absolutely this joint venture at Gateway, we're very excited about it. We think it's going to create a lot of value for shareholders versus what we own right now. But it's very specific, it was very specific to the fact that Alexandria owned the assets next door, and had these sites where the development potential was unlocked. So that's why we did it.","As it relates to joint ventures overall, we're increasingly using joint ventures in our portfolio for different reasons than the Gateway project. We recently brought in CPP to own a 45% interest in the Platform 16 project. They are our partner on the Santa Monica Business Park acquisition that we, I guess, increasingly less recently made. So we are continuing and will continue to inject private equity into our investment portfolio to extend our capital. The rationale for that is very different from the rationale of the Gateway joint venture.","Vikram Malhotra","Great. And then just one last quick one. So The Street retail deals you referenced earlier in \u2013 the two deals I think you recently did. Maybe just give us \u2013 there's obviously been a lot of churn in Fifth Avenue, Madison sort of submarkets, and I'm just curious your thought \u2013 you don't have a \u2013 there's not a massive exposure there, but just your thoughts on where we are in the sort of evolution in terms of rent resets, and do you have a sense of where rents at grade might be there and the two specifics of markets where you have exposure?","Owen Thomas","So the answer is, obviously we know what the rents are for the deals that we just did. But we're not going to disclose the specifics of what those tenants are paying. I\u2019d just make two comments and then John Powers, if you want to make some more, you are welcome. The first is that we have now had our second, what I refer to as a successful tenant look at the Fifth Avenue store that we have as a great place to conduct their business while they are doing an ongoing remodel, and they've paid what we would believe are fair market rents for that space, but they have not invested in it on a long-term basis.","And then on Madison Avenue, we recognize that the rents are not where they were five years ago and so there's a reset and we're \u2013 that's just the reality. John, do you have any other comments?","John Powers","We don't have any retail exposures in that area, obviously the overall rents have dropped in the retail market, but for specific store, for a specific need, there were still people in the market looking at different alternatives. What we've done in some of our other retail is concentrate on food and beverage because that's an amenity to the office towers, which is very important.","Vikram Malhotra","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you. Wonderful quarter. Wonderful guidance. Life is good. One question, Mike you're bouncing up around us. 6.3, 6.4 net debt to EBITDA and I think you're on a path to deliver about 800 million to 1 billion of development every year, maybe sell 200 million to 400 million of assets. What is your self-imposed maximum on your net debt to EBITDA? And when do you anticipate needing to go to the equity markets, if at all? ","Michael LaBelle","So we've been pretty consistent over the last many years of targeting net debt to EBITDA between 6.5x and 7.5x. So we've been able to do a lot of development and deliver a lot of properties without raising equity. We have a number of opportunities in front of us, including two, we talked about today. And things that are in the future pipeline and as we determine, if those and when those will come in. We will look at all of the sources of capital that are available to us.","So we've mentioned private equity, and bringing that in and we did that with CPP. We can bring in additional debt, which is very attractive and very inexpensive. And we would also consider public equity in the future, to make sure that we maintain our leverage in a place where we think we should be.","John Guinee","Great. Then just a couple of a cleanup questions up. I don't think 30 Hudson in your development page on the sup, any reason for that? Or maybe I just missed it. And then second, is everything going smoothly on a Dock 72 and we work taking it on time, taking the space on time.","Owen Thomas","I'll respond just to the 3 Hudson. So, right now that's in our land position and the work that we're doing there is improving the land and since we have not made a commitment or decision to move forward with that full development. We are not putting it on our development page until such time as we would do that.","And that's very similar to the way that we handle these other projects. And we for example, Platform 16 that we talked about, we're doing enabling work, we're doing prep work, so we're improving the land that we have. But until we decide that we're going forward, we aren't going to put those projects on the development pipeline.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Owen Thomas","John, do you want to make a comment about on Dock 72?","John Powers","Yes. Everything is fine on the WeWork side there. They built out about two-thirds of this space and they're paying rent on all this space. They have a good number of members signed up. We are slow unfortunately on the amenities and we need to get that done. That will be done in the first quarter, and after that's complete, we should \u2013 we expect that more WeWork members were moved in. The amenities of 35,000 feet and they're a key part of what we're creating there.","On the leasing side, it's been very slow. As you know, we do have a proposal and we're trading paper on a 50,000-foot full floor, which we're optimistic about, but we'll have to see how it comes out.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors.","Daniel Ismail","Thank you, and good morning. For the observation deck at Prudential Tower, is this something you're going to seek to manage internally or look for an operator? And then are there any opportunities to add this and other developments like 3 Hudson?","Owen Thomas","So Danny, we haven't made any decisions, firm decisions, yet about how the observation deck on the Prudential Tower will get operated. Interestingly that it exists and therefore doing a major renovation of it obviously made a lot of sense.","We thought about having an observation deck when we were developing Salesforce Tower, but we just couldn't make the vertical transportation work in that building given where the design had already been. And I would say that, at the moment, none of our other assets are candidates for those types of uses.","Daniel Ismail","All right. Thank you. And then on Proposition E is on the ballots in San Francisco in March. Assuming it passes, does this cause you guys to change your thinking on development timing or acquisitions outside of the city? And are you hearing anything from tenants regarding this ballot initiative?","Owen Thomas","So Bob, do you want to explain what the ballot initiative E is so everyone understands it?","Robert Pester","Yes. Proposition E is a ballot measure put forth by Todco, John Elberling. And basically, it would tie affordable housing deliveries to the amount of office space that could be delivered in San Francisco, thereby reducing the amount of Prop M allocation if the affordable housing goals aren't met. It's pulling fairly well right now. In our case, the Central SoMa projects all would get their existing allocation that's still outstanding.","So in our case, we'd get another 250,000 feet because they want to get the fees from the developers up front. We're not hearing anything from any tenants as far as it's impacting their desire to be in San Francisco or they're looking elsewhere. And San Francisco has always been a difficult market develop in. So I don't think it really changes anything.","Daniel Ismail","Do you think this would impact an accelerated phasing of projects in San Francisco or elsewhere?","Robert Pester","Only on the Central SoMa projects that have already been approved where it would accelerate the second phase of their Prop M allotment. What the impact will be is existing product, the rent should continue to rise substantially because it's going to restrict supply.","Owen Thomas","So Danny, the way this works is that, that the projects that are currently in the pipeline in South and Central SoMa will get their additional allocation. The reason why there would be a theory in acceleration is because if you don't use your Prop M allocation within a certain period of time, Bob, I think it's two years.","Robert Pester","Two years.","Owen Thomas","It goes back into the bank, and so to the extent that you get the allocation, you'd want to figure out a way to use it.","Daniel Ismail","All right. Makes sense. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay. Well, I think that concludes all the questions. That concludes all of management's remarks. Thank you all for your attention and interest in Boston Properties. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day."],"3423":["Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 30, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arista Joyner - Investor Relations Manager","Mortimer B.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties' third quarter earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bostonproperties.com.","An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Tuesday's press release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Having said that, I'd like to welcome Mort Zuckerman, Executive Chairman; Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. We're delighted to have the chance once again to have a dialogue with you. As you all appreciate, I'm sure, we're living in a kind of uncertain economic time in general, with a very weak growth in the general economy. In real terms, it's probably growing at a rate of about 1.5% and the average over the last 4 years has been about 1.8%, 1.9% and this compares to previous 4-year periods coming out of recession of all 8 previous recessions since the end of '02 [ph] of 4.1%. Nevertheless, I must say that we have found in our particular sector of the office building market. We have enjoyed, I think, a fairly good response from our general clientele and we continue to be comfortable with leasing that we are undertaking and experiencing in the context of these generally weak times. And I think we are continuing to be very cautious about what we do and yet feel very comfortable that we have the both the financial resources and locations that will enable us to take advantage of both development opportunities, which we will describe, and leasing opportunities for our existing buildings.","So on balance, I must say that we have demonstrated, I hope, it is a fair thing to say, that the quality of the assets we have in the locations we have and in the markets we have, have demonstrated not only their strengths in good markets but their strength in weaker markets. We continue to do well in terms of our leasing and I think we're going to show that we are able to develop not only additional rental revenues but a number of additional development opportunities that will continue the path of growth that we have had over all these years.","With that, I will turn it over to Owen, who will give you more information about the company. I'll probably join in on a couple of other comments later on.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay, Mort, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm joined here in Boston by Doug Linde and Mike LaBelle. And the 3 of us will describe our performance and results for the third quarter, provide some color on the current operating environment and describe our current capital allocation strategy. We will also discuss in more detail the FFO guidance for 2014.","As Mort described, we continue to experience a sluggish recovery in the U.S. However, as we've discussed before, there are bright spots in several industries, such as technology, life sciences, health care and smaller-scale financials, which are benefiting our operating performance in several of our key markets such as Cambridge, San Francisco, Midtown, New York and Princeton.","In the third quarter, we performed well. Specifically, we executed 85 leases, representing approximately 1.9 million square feet of space with reasonable balance across our portfolio geographically. Though San Francisco and Washington were the largest contributors. Our in-service properties, in the aggregate, are 92.8% leased at the end of the third quarter, up 70 basis points from 92.1% leased at the end of the second quarter.","Also, importantly, during the quarter, we made significant progress in identifying tenants for our remaining existing vacancy and our properties under development, which we hope will be reflected in signed leases in the coming quarters.","Now turning to capital strategy. Due to a continued weakness in job creation, more mixed signals from the Fed and the nomination of Janet Yellen as Chairman of Federal Reserve, it would appear fear of rising interest rates, at least for the short and medium term, has subsided somewhat. Nevertheless, our capital strategy has remained largely unchanged from the last quarter. We continue to actively monetize assets, most recently closing on the sale of a 45% interest in Times Square Tower.","Year-to-date, we've sold 5 assets, raising $1.2 billion in proceeds and we currently have 3 additional assets in the market: a small project in suburban Boston; a building in suburban Maryland; and our Avenue apartment asset in Washington. You should expect our selected monetization activity to continue.","Let me add one comment related to asset sales. While we've given ourselves the flexibility to enter into a 1031 like kind exchange with the Times Square transaction, at the moment, we have not identified such a property. Therefore, our gain, which is approximately $386 million or $2.25 per share would likely result in a special dividend to shareholders.","Now continuing with capital allocation strategy. We do continue to pursue acquisitions but are finding pricing aggressive for high-quality office assets in our focus market. Our development pipeline remains robust at $2.5 billion in active projects, plus we have a number of additional high-quality developments under consideration, assuming receptive market conditions. Delivery of all these developments will be a key driver of our growth in coming quarters.","Thank you, and I'll turn the conversation over to Doug, for a more detailed review of our markets.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I am going to try and give some color to the numerical information that Mike is going to talk about predominantly about our 2014 guidance. So I'm going to describe what's going on in the portfolio, what's going on in the markets, but most importantly, all of these things are influencing our 2014 projections and they're all embedded in the guidance for 2014. So there's going to be a lot of facts and figures that I'm going to provide you, and I promise, I'll talk as slowly as I possibly can.","I'm going to start in Boston or the Boston market. Cambridge, on the other side of the river, is probably the strongest office submarket that we have in the region. It's got both the biotech and the life sciences and the technology companies all in a very concentrated area. At this quarter, we delivered our expansion building for Google at Cambridge Center, which is going to hit this quarter but ramp up next year, and we also did our first early renewal. And I talked last quarter about the fact that we don't have any availability in Cambridge, which is in fact still the case, but we do have 14, 15 and 16 renewal opportunities. So the first one was a 67,000 square foot renewal and the markup was 75% on that space. Office rents in Cambridge are in the low 60s right now, which is about a 30% increase year-over-year. So, in 2014, we're going to get a full year of benefit from 17 Cambridge Center, that's the building that we delivered earlier this year to Biogen, we'll get a full contribution from the expansion for Google and net incremental revenue growth of about $7 million.","Again with 100% occupied, we have a 140,000 square feet of late-2014 lease expirations and about 210,000 square feet of 2015 lease expirations, and there are significant opportunities for roll up in both of those assets.","In addition, we are working with the City of Cambridge right now on the entitlements for a new residential project in Cambridge Center, it's probably about 200 units, $100 million, plus or minus, of investment that we hope to get started, assuming we get the approval, in the early part of 2015. And we are also working on additional density on -- at Cambridge Center, through an overlay district that the city has encouraged us to pursue.","Across the river, in the Back Bay, the rents in the Back Bay Towers are in the mid-$70s at the top, starting rents in the lower portion of those buildings are probably in the high-$40s which interestingly is a discount to Cambridge right now.","At the Hancock Tower, we are in lease negotiations with 5 existing tenants, which totals about 225,000 square feet on relocations or renewals in the building. This quarter, we signed 115,000 square foot relocation and an extension. So to date, in Cambridge -- excuse me, at the Hancock Tower, we signed 446,000 square feet of early renewals or relocations. Now the interesting thing is that 236,000 square feet of this isn't going to impact our revenues until 2015 because there's a prime lease with Manulife and these were all subtenants that are all going direct. But the roll up on all of this income is a minimum of $15 a square foot, or about 27% on average, in-place rents in the building. Again, really good embedded growth that we're going to get, we just haven't got it yet and we're not going to get it in '14.","The remainder of our urban portfolio in Boston really has pretty limited opportunities for occupancy or revenue gains in '14. At the Pru Center Complex, we released our last full floor at 111 Huntington Avenue this quarter. And you have to remember that we signed a 15-year lease for about 310,000 square feet last year with Blue Cross Blue Shield, and they are going to be moving into 101 Huntington Avenue in the second quarter of 2015. Now, we're getting this space back in 3 chunks in 2014 and the revenue loss from the rolldown -- or rollover from the existing tenants until we get to 2015 is about $10 million. So that is again embedded in our projections for 2014.","At Atlantic Wharf, we're 100% leased. And we will be at a full run rate in 2014. At 100 Federal Street, we're getting back 1 52,000 square foot floor in January and we do experience -- we do expect to have some downtime on that floor in 2014. Average rents in the downtown market are between $40, mid-$40s at the base of the building to the low-$60s at the top of the building.","Our suburban Boston portfolio continues to be very active. Rents in Waltham are up slightly year-over-year and our deals with Bay Colony are all generally starting in the mid-$30s today. During the third quarter, we completed 71,000 square feet of leasing, bringing our total to about 300,000 square feet during the year. At Bay Colony, we have now completed 165,000 square feet of new leases and we are in negotiations with 2 more large tenants that will bring the total to 275,000 square feet of incremental occupancy growth that's going to start in 2014. These include another 55,000-square-foot life science company, our fourth at Bay Colony, as well as a large multinational software developer. There is a growing pipeline of additional suburban requirements and we continue to see strong activity in the Waltham market, really stemming from an expansion of life sciences and technology, as Owen described.","Moving to New York City. Our third quarter New York City activity on the in-service portfolio was really an acceleration of the strong activity that we described last quarter. Demand from high-end small service -- small financial services firms really continued. During the quarter, we completed 18 separate transactions, totaling 168,000 square feet. We did 6 more deals at 540 Madison, bringing our total in that building to 14, and we have 3 more in negotiation right now.","At 510 Madison, we've completed 2 more full-floor deals, bringing the total year-to-date to 5. So 510 Madison now sits at about 80% leased, not occupied vis-\u00e0-vis the supplemental, because the leases haven't commenced yet, but 80% leased. And our expectations for both buildings 510 and 540 are to be in the 90%s by the end of 2014. The acting and the taking rents at 540 and 510 really have not changed for us over the last year, and quite frankly, nor has the overall pace of market activity at the high-end market, which we defined as tenants who were prepared to pay over $90 a square foot, and we really don\u2019t see much in the way of changes in that in 2014. Our pricing at 540 Madison is from the mid-$70s to the low-$90s, and at 510 Madison, it's from the low-$90s to the mid-$130s.","The remainder of our in-service portfolio is 99% leased in Manhattan. We will be getting 1 floor back sometime towards the middle of 2014 at 767 Fifth, the GM Building, and we'll see how attractive that space is to the market, given the building is literally 100% leased today.","Our predominant user and our target tenant for all of our available space in Midtown continues to be the small hedge funds and asset managers, advisers and the other smaller entities who are involved in the financial services industry. And again, the tenant activity for this market continues to be very encouraging.","When we discussed 250 West 55th Street last quarter, we said we had a number of multi-floor prospects that we were considering and negotiating with, and that we had multiple tours but we really hadn't began to respond to proposals. Well, we've now signed Letters of Intent with 2 of these tenants, are in lease negotiations on space totaling an incremental 242,000 square feet. We've currently leased 468,000 square feet, so this brings us to 710,000 square feet or 72% committed, and it leaves us with 7 full floors and 2 floors of prebuilt, many of which you, I think, have seen in your tours recently.","We continue to have an active pipeline of 1- and 2-floor prospects that continue to tour the remaining space. So the translation of this activity into revenues is as follows: we will commence revenue recognition on the 468,000 square feet in mid-2014; and the contributions to 2014 NOI is only $10 million. When the 2 leases that are under negotiation get signed, they will, along with hopefully other leases that we're working on, contribute in early-2015 and we expect to stabilize the building at an overall return of just above 6% in 2016.","Mike will address the offsetting capitalized interest reductions in his remarks.","In DC, the budgetary issues and the continuation of sequestration still is a factor. It creates an overlay of uncertainty in the private markets, as well as the public sector. In spite of all of that, we completed 2 major leases, totaling 368,000 square feet, during the quarter in Reston, with defense contractors, that covered 75% of our 2014 and 2015 leased expirations in Reston Town Center. Rents in Reston Town Center continue to be $15 to $25 a square foot, in excess of what can be achieved in buildings on the Toll Road. Our new apartment development, The Avant, is opening at the beginning of November, and we expect to generate a stabilized return on cost of over 7.5% as it leases over the next 14 to 15 months, stabilizing by early 2015.","Now just before the government shutdown last month, we were able to sign a 125,000 square-foot 10-year lease with the Army Corps, to fully lease our new development at Annapolis Junction, which is adjacent to the NSA and the Cyber Command at Fort Meade. Again, revenue is not going to be able to be recognized until the second quarter of '15 because the tenant has asked us to manage a significant additional infrastructure investment.","The Montgomery office market continues to be the softest in the D.C. area and we are continuing to execute on our decision to exit our holdings in the market. As Owen described, we have a suburban office building on the market right now and we really don\u2019t anticipate much in the way of improvements in Montgomery County in '14. The absence of incremental demand from the GSA and the District; and changes in space utilization that we've talked about before; as well as the lack, to date, of any new demand generators, but there are people talking about changes to the city that will help that, are the headwinds that the CBD is still facing. So second-generation space is still plentiful and landlords have, surprise, surprise, expanded their tenant improvement packages to encourage tenants to relocate. And guess what, tenants are going to migrate to newer, more efficient installations in the CBD. We don't have any 2014 lease exposure but we do have some law firm relocation activity that we expect to happen in '15 and '16, but Ray and our team in D.C. is out in front of this and we're working on replacing tenants as we speak. Our D.C. portfolio continues to be 96% leased.","At Carnegie Center, we continue to gain both occupancy and extend leases. During the quarter, we did 13 leases for 372,000 square feet. So in 2013, we've completed 11 leases with new or expanding tenants, totaling 179,000 square feet or a 9% increase in occupancy at Carnegie Center, and we continue to be in discussions with tenants for additional expansion. And while the life science sector is really at the core of the expansion at Carnegie Center, you saw our press release last night, and we've completed a 15-year build-to-suit negotiation with NRG, which is an energy company, for 130,000 square feet that's going to get delivered in 2016. NRG is going to be expanding from about 90,000 square feet today. So for '14, we will average over 90% occupancy at Carnegie Center.","The majority of our activity in San Francisco this quarter was outside the city. We did 2 lease extensions with Genentech at our Gateway project, but it involved a 50,000 square foot of reduction in their occupancy in 2014, which is embedded in our guidance.","Activity in South San Francisco continues to be slow and we expect to carry this pace for a while during 2014. Activity in the Silicon Valley during the third quarter started to shift from the large requirement to the 50,000 to 80,000-square-foot tenant that seem to be out in the space, given the IPO flurry and they're starting to ramp up their hiring and look for expansion. We are in the midst of a re-skinning of our Zanker asset in order to prove the marketability of those assets to those types of companies. We've experienced extended vacancy in those buildings because they were older and so we decided to go through and do a major re-skinning, which we expect to be completed in early 2014. Given that, we're not really budgeting much in the way an income in '14, and in fact, Lockheed Martin is going to be consolidating out of a 165,000-square-foot building in December of this year, so we're going to have about 438,000 square feet of availability at Zanker.","In the San Francisco CBD, the lease expiration driven transactions from the traditional financial service law firm tenants are increasing. There's an 8% availability rate in the market and there is continued expansion from technology tenants. But there's still a gap between tenant's expectations and our expectation for the right rents for renewals and for new leases in the premier buildings.","Last quarter, I suggested that there was a pretty wide gap, well it's narrowing, and deals are starting to be made. In fact, while the view rents are still in the $70s to the $90s, we are actually entering a lease negotiation now with a tenant for the 2.5 floors that we have available in the mid-rise of EC4, which we were waiting on patiently for quite some time. We believe that the leases will get done in the mid $70s and that the market really is starting to improve for the financial-services-type tenants looking for their next space in the CBD.","In 2014 to 2015, mark-to-market at Embarcadero Center is going to run between 15% and 25% on a lease-by-lease basis. The overall pace of activity in '13 really is in line with the activity at this time last year which was about 5 million square feet of space for the first 3 quarters.","Now last year did end with a million-square-foot expansion from Salesforce, so we don't have any expectations that, that's going to happen again. But we think 2013 is going to look very similar to the overall activity in 2010 and 2011, which is about 6.5 million square feet.","Activity from the tech sector, as a percentage of tenants in the market, interestingly, has actually decreased from 2\/3 of the demand last year to about half of it this year. It's not that the tech activity has declined at all, in fact, there are just as many tech users in the market. But the traditional financial services, asset management companies are now conducting searches as the wave of the lease expirations that we've talked about before, between 2015 and 2017, hit the market. We are negotiating a lease for all of our available space at the 50 Hawthorne building, 55,000 square feet, with a tech user, so the tech demand is still there. And 680 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne is going to be put in service in the second quarter of '14 and is expected to generate about a 6.1% return. The construction of 535 Mission Street is on schedule, steel is up to the 14th floor and we expect to be able to deliver space to tenants in the latter half of '14, with occupancy and rent revenue recognition starting in early '15. We're encouraged by the initial inquiries in fit plans for the tenants -- for the building. Remember, the building has 13,000-square-foot floors and we anticipated that it was going to be leased to a broad range of small and medium-sized technology and legal and financial services and other kinds of tenants. Just to give you a perspective on that demand set, for the market. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, there was about 2.5 million square feet of leasing activity under 25,000 square feet, but over 5,000 square feet, in 230 transactions. That's the market for 535 Mission. And those tenants typically make leasing commitments within 12 months of their lease expiration. So if the building isn't really going to be available until the end of '14, early '15, we think that there's going to -- and we anticipate that the activity for this building really will pick up during the first half of 2014. If we average leases with starting rents in the mid-$60s, we're going to deliver this building at a low 7% NOI return.","I'm going to finish my remarks just with a little color on our second-generation statistics, because, unfortunately, each quarter, the devil is in the details. In Boston, the transactions are almost exclusively in the suburbs and the gross rent went from $31.50 to $29.62, or less than a $2 difference.","In New York City, there was one deal of 60,000 square feet at 601 Lex, where the rent went from $112 square foot fully escalated, the lease was signed in 2006, to about $100 a square foot. That's the downturn there. And in Princeton, the decline included 12,000 square feet and the main negative was a 1-year holdover that went to a market deal. So a surprise when the tenants had holdover, they're paying an above-market rent. In San Francisco, a majority of the deals were small transactions in Embarcadero Center.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into a discussion of our 2014 guidance, I do want to spend a few minutes on our results this quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year.","For the third quarter, we reported diluted funds from operations of $1.29 per share, that was about $0.01 above the mid-point of our guidance range, or about $2 million. The portfolio NOI was about $2.5 million better than we expected, mostly due to savings in operating expenses and we anticipate giving those back in the fourth quarter. Our hotel performance was up by about $1 million over expectations and on the other side, our G&A was up a little bit and we incurred some unbudgeted transaction costs that's mostly related to the sale of Times Square Tower. So overall, we were pretty closely aligned with our expectations.","As you see in our press release, we sold 1301 New York Avenue in the quarter and we booked a gain on sale of $86 million. We've successfully structured the sale of the 1301 Exchange with the acquisitions that we completed earlier this year. So the gain will not have an impact on our dividend.","The most significant impact to our funds from operation for the rest of 2013 is the sale of the 45% interest in times Square Tower, which we closed on October 9. The sale was projected to reduce our FFO by $0.05 per share in 2013 and $0.20 per share in 2014. We will continue to consolidate the building on our books due to the control we retained in managing the venture. So the deduction for our partner's share of the income is going to be reflected in noncontrolling interest. So it's similar to the accounting for the GM Building.","To help you understand our economic share, we actually added a new page to our supplemental disclosure this quarter, that provides the financial details of each of our consolidated joint ventures.","As we foreshadowed, our occupancy this quarter improved by 70 basis points and our same-store cash NOI growth accelerated to 8% over 2012. As Doug mentioned, we've seen good success this year, leasing a portion of our vacancy in suburban Boston, in Princeton, and at 510 Madison Avenue, which is showing up in our NOI.","For the full year 2013, we now expect same-store GAAP NOI to be up 2.5% to 3% and same-store cash NOI to be up 5.25% to 5.75% over 2012. Our straight-line rent and fair value lease income is expected to be $90 million to $94 million.","Our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is in line with our discussion last quarter. We expect it to contribute $65 million to $67 million in 2013. Our hotel demonstrated better core performance this quarter and for 2013 we expect it to contribute NOI of $10.5 million to $11.5 million. On the development and management services income side, we are right in line with our projections that we gave last quarter. We expect them to be $27 million to $28 million for the year.","This quarter, we modified our G&A presentation by incorporating the overhead costs associated with our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices into our G&A. Historically, as small regional offices existing primarily to manage Embarcadero Center and Carnegie Center, we have been recording the regional overhead as property operating expenses and with our growing activity in San Francisco, and to be consistent across the company, we've elected this quarter to reclassify the expense for this quarter and past quarters projected to be $8.5 million in 2013 that has been moved to G&A.","Now this is purely a geographic change moving from property operating expenses to G&A. It has no impact on our FFO, but it does result in some improvement in our property operating margin. With this change and an increase of about $1 million in health care expenses, our projected 2013 G&A is now $116 million to $118 million.","After a lot of movement last quarter from the consolidation of the GM Building and our activity in the bond market, our interest expense this quarter of $122 million, reflects a clean run rate. For the year, we're projecting net interest expense of $437 million to $439 million, a little better than last quarter due to higher interest income.","So in summary, for 2013, our FFO projection for the full year is now $4.86 to $4.88 per share, which is in line, but for the loss of $0.05 per share from the partial interest sale of Times Square Tower. For the fourth quarter, we project diluted funds from operations of $1.23 to $1.25.","Now turning to our stocks for 2014, Owen mentioned some of our sales activity which totals $1.2 billion this year, and that includes 125 West 55th Street, 1301 New York Avenue, 303 Almaden and Times Square Tower. Now net of the positive impact from the acquisition that we made in Mountain View, our program will result in a reduction of about $32 million or $0.19 per share of FFO in 2014.","On the positive side, we're recycling a portion of the sales proceeds into our development pipeline, part of which will start to deliver in 2014. Next year, we will see a full year of earnings from 17 Cambridge Center, plus about $1.5 billion of our new projects will start to deliver, which includes 250 West 55th Street, 680 Folsom and our Avant residential development in Reston. As Doug detailed, these projects would generate some incremental income in 2014, but they won\u2019t be stabilized and provide a full run rate until 2015 and 2016. In aggregate, these projects are projected to provide incremental NOI in 2014 of $28 million to $30 million. When stabilized the aggregate of these developments, which is weighted by 250 West 55th Street, are projected to generate returns in the low- to mid-6% range and contribute meaningful growth to our earnings.","We expect our portfolio is going to continue to demonstrate growth on both the GAAP and a cash basis. Doug did mentioned a few larger explorations at the Prudential Center and at suburban San Francisco, and these leases that totaled 550,000 Square feet will tamper our NOI growth and occupancy improvement, which we expect to average between 92.5% and 93.5% during 2014. We're projecting solid performance out of the rest of the portfolio including occupancy growth at Bay Colony, 510 Madison Avenue, Reston Town Center and Embarcadero Center, resulting in projected same-store GAAP NOI growth in 2014 of 1% to 2.5% over 2013, despite 100 basis points of drag from the 3 large move-outs.","As we mentioned last quarter, on a cash basis, we're projecting another strong year of growth in the portfolio. Our projections for 2014 same-store cash NOI growth are 5% to 6%, or roughly $65 million of improvement over 2013. This represents 2 consecutive years of strong cash flow growth. And as Doug noted, we're building our 2015 cash flow by working through early renewals with positive mark-to-market in Cambridge and at the Hancock Tower and new leasing in Reston, Bay Colony, the Prudential Center, Embarcadero Center and Midtown Manhattan. Our noncash, straight line and fair value lease revenue for 2014 is projected to be $70 million to $85 million, and that includes $30 million from our developments. We're projecting our hotel to continue to perform well in 2014 and projected contributing $12 million to $13 million in NOI.","The contribution of FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures is projected to be $29 million to $34 million, this reflects some improvement from our current run rate with anticipated occupancy growth at 540 Madison Avenue. In our fee income from development and management services income, we project $20 million to $23 million in 2014. Now this is lower than 2013 and it's because the roll off of several key development projects that includes the Patriot's Park Development, the Broad Institute and 500 North Capitol Street, as well as the change in geography of the fees associated with the GM Building that we discussed last quarter.","We project our G&A expense to be $100 million to $104 million in 2014. This is about $15 million less than in 2013 projection due to the majority of charges associated with our management transition rolling off. Our 2014 projection does still include $4 million of remaining transition charges. Also projected in 2014 is a 3% annual G&A increase and lower capitalized wages as a sizable portion of our development pipeline is delivering.","Our 2014 interest expense will be lower than our current run rate with the payoff of our $747.5 million of exchangeable notes that come due in mid-February that carries a GAAP interest rate of 6.55% and a cash interest rate of 3.625%. We also have another $63 million mortgage loan with an interest rate of 5.5% that expires in October, and we project paying that off with cash. We are not projecting raising any additional capital in 2014 and we expect our cash balances to be in excess of $500 million at the end of the year even after paying off our expiring debt and funding our projected development costs through the end of 2014. We expect the capitalized interest will be $12 million to $15 million lower in 2014, which is mostly due to 250 West 55th Street, where we will stop all interest capitalization in the third quarter of 2014.","In total, we project our net interest expense for 2014 to be $448 million to $452 million. We project our 2014 capitalized interest to be $54 million to $58 million. As we discussed last quarter, due to the consolidation of the GM Building, our interest expense includes $28 million that is associated with our partners' loans that will come back to us in the noncontrolling interest line.","As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to consolidate Times Square Tower after the partial interest sale. And our partners' share of income will show as a deduction in noncontrolling interest. For 2014, we project the deduction for noncontrolling interest to be $68 million to $72 million, which includes $34 million for Times Square Tower. So when we combine all of our assumptions, our projections for 2014 funds from operation are $5.27 to $5.35 per share. And this represents a significant increase of 8% over 2013 reflecting the steady portfolio NOI growth, the power of our development deliveries, and our taking advantage of an attractive interest rate environment by raising debt in the first half of 2013.","Once again, I want to stress that we made the strategic decision to sell certain assets in 2013 resulting in a loss of $0.22 per share of FFO in 2014. Had we kept these buildings, our projected FFO growth would be even stronger in 2014. The sale of Times Square Tower, which we just announced 3 weeks ago, has the largest impact. And our 2014 FFO guidance range would have been $5.40 to $5.55 without the sale. We also have several additional buildings on the market that Owen discussed. We have not included the sale of any of these buildings in our projections. And combined, they contribute an annual FFO of approximately $0.08 per share.","Owen D. Thomas","Mort, before we get the questions, I don't know if you wanted to add anything else.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes. I think I would like to make a reference, if I may, to the continued shareholder interest in our Transbay development in San Francisco. We wanted to provide an update of our progress to date and our thinking about our future plan. As you know, we have contracted to develop the property to grade. Work on this phase of the project has commenced and will be completed in 2015. And our total investment in Transbay from site acquisition and development to grade will approximate $350 million. We have assembled the market leading -- leasing team and are having productive dialogues with potential tenants. So we believe leasing prospects will be enhanced by demonstrated construction progress below and above ground, decisions on whether to proceed with the vertical development of the project, do not need to be made until next year.","We're refining our final design and exploring ancillary revenue opportunities given the scale and the location of the building. We remain very enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for the San Francisco market, which we believe is the best office market in the country. And we see overall office and residential demand to be quite amazing in that market. And we continue to believe that when complete, Transbay will represent one of San Francisco's most iconic, well-located and valuable office assets.","We've had a long history of being able to go into markets and acquire sites and start building, even when we don't have leases. And in a market like San Francisco, this is the kind of market where we think we can really take advantage of both the site we have and the experience we have, and to produce what we will describe and what we will believe will be the single most prominent building in San Francisco.","I think that's really the one thing that I would like to add to our commentary. And I think at this point I will finish my own remarks.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay, operator, I think we can open up the lines for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Sorry. I guess the question is really related around kind of the dispositions and the inability to put capital to work. And I guess I'm just wondering, it sounds like you've got a couple of small assets, but do you contemplate bringing other large assets to market today given how frothy the disposition market seems to be? And then secondly, I know, historically, you guys looked at maybe selling off Princeton, but that market seems to be rebounding quite nicely for you. I'm just wondering kind of where that portfolio stands in the kind of the disposition process?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Well, please everybody join in. But -- look, we are, I have to say optimistic in a general sense, both in terms of development and in terms of disposition. We are always looking to the possibility of translating some of the assets we have through sales into the kinds of revenues or cash flow or cash, simply because we think that there are times to sale as well as times to buy. And we have felt that this is a market, as you stated, where the purchasing market is, shall we say, frothy. But I mean, I have received letters from major real estate firms asking if we have any properties for sale because there's a huge market for it. In that environment, sometimes we look at assets and are prepared to think and consider their possible sales, because we do believe we can recycle the money into developments and create a lot more value out of those developments and what we think is appropriate for an asset or what is relevant to an asset, which is fairly completed, fully leased with a different kind of appreciation future. So with this, it\u2019s just an opportunistic view of looking at our assets what we do and what we sell, and that has been a part of our history for long time and will continue to be a part of our future.","Douglas T. Linde","Just to add to the Steve. So I think there are sort of 2 buckets of assets that we look at from an exit perspective. There are those assets that we have deemed to be sort of outside of where we think the patterns of growth or the abilities to add additional value sort of on an incremental basis are, and those are sort of few and far between. But there's a handful of suburban assets that could sort of fit that scope of criteria. And then there are the assets that are, I would say, more core to what Boston Properties is all about. And to the extent that somebody's going to provide us with an offer that reflects a dramatically different perspective view on the growth characteristics of the cash flows from that assets. I think we ought it to ourselves to consider looking at those assets and looking at whether or not we can better redeploy the capital elsewhere, all right. And so those are sort of the 2 baskets that we sort of look at when we're approaching those decisions. And with regards to Carnegie Center, that's how we're going to approach it as we look into 2014 and we're going to make that determination as we best see fit.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I just had a follow-up for Mike LaBelle. I guess when you were going through your list of FY '14 numbers, I think you said that the developments would contribute $28 million to $30 million of NOI partially, but I didn't hear a destabilize number that got to the low-6% yield, I guess, that would be by late '15 or maybe early '16. What was that number?","Michael E. LaBelle","Well, that's related to $1.5 billion of development delivering at a low- to mid-6% NOI yield. And that will deliver The Avant residential project, as Doug mentioned, is going to lease up during '14 and be stabilized in early '15, 250 West 55th Street will be fully stabilized by 2016. It's going to be income coming in, in '14, income coming in through '15 and should be fully in by '16.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping you could just provide your latest thoughts on some new supply risk in both San Francisco and New York?","Douglas T. Linde","Well, let's talk about San Francisco first. So in San Francisco, there is one building that is currently under construction after -- other than 535 that was done on a speculative basis which is Foundry III. And I believe, at this point, Foundry III has leased 80% of its available space to 2 or 3 technology companies. And that all of that activity has happened in the last, call it, 9 to 10 weeks. And I think a couple of leases haven't been signed yet. And then after 535, Tishman Speyer has one available building and assuming Jay Paul gets his permits, he will have a new building and then there's the Transbay Tower sort of for the next \"group of potential assets that are likely to hit in '15 to '17 time frame.\" New York City, I think is it's all about the Hudson Yards with regards to lead tenant activity and then the Brookfield land partial next to Farley. And then finally what happens down at the World Trade Center buildings from the perspective of new additional tenant demand starting off those buildings, I think, they're more build to suits than they are speculative opportunities. To be honest about New York City, particularly in the large tenant market, the real issue is the consolidation of the large financial services companies. And I'm sure Brookfield talks a lot about this more than we do downtown, because they have, obviously, a portfolio there. But Chase is going to be moving out of 1 Chase Plaza. Barclays had some space that's on the sublet market. Citigroup is obviously talking about a potential consolidation someplace in the city, which would presumably mean giving up space. And so there are large blocks of space predominantly downtown that are going to be a factor in, in I think the way tenants view large opportunities for new real estate development over the next 3 to 4 years.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then I guess sticking with Citi, do you have any update on their plans at 399 Park?.","Douglas T. Linde","We don't. So Citi is in about 500-plus thousand square feet at 399. 100,000 square feet of that is retail-oriented space on the ground floor, about 90,000 square feet is concourse space. So they have about 350,000 square feet of office space in the building, and of that about 150,000 square feet is sublet to other tenants. So their physical use of space at 399 is just over 200,000 to 225,000 square feet on the office side. And presumably, whatever decision that they make regarding their next home on a long-term basis will have an impact on 399.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Attie from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How are your thoughts on Transbay evolving with respect to bringing in a capital partner.","Owen D. Thomas","We're still open to that possibility because there's more to gain. A lot will depend on where we are with major tenants and conversations with major tenants. But for the moment we haven't made any decision on that.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You're generating a lot of asset sale proceeds and finding it difficult to source acquisitions. Beyond Transbay, is there a shadow development pipeline where you can put some of the money to work? And if there is, can you talk a little bit about it?","Owen D. Thomas","Let me just say, just in general. That's the fundamental part of our business, which is really looking for these kinds of sites and seeing where we are in terms of the attractiveness of the sites and possibility of their development. And the nature of the market is such, it's not a sort of a steady flow of opportunities or of leasing. So we just have to be opportunistic in that regard and we really don't have anything to make in the way of public comments other than just sort of general statements. Anybody else want to add anything to this.","Douglas T. Linde","Yes. I think I kind of look at that sort of a layup question, because it sort of -- it points to sort of where the opportunities for us are in the near to short term. So we have this residential development that we are taking about in Cambridge. We are in the process of permitting 2 additional residential sites in Reston on the site that we purchased earlier this year. We're talking about a build-to-suit opportunity in suburban Boston on our sites at 10 and 20 CityPoint. We have 2 or 3 tenants there that are actively looking at that. We are in the process of going through the rezoning of the significant development there. I think we referred to pretty directly in our Analyst Meeting about a year ago in Reston, when the new rail station comes to our property at overlook, and the opportunities to build millions of square feet of density, some of it commercial, some of it residential, some of it potentially hotel or retail. On that particular parcel, tangent to our existing development in Reston Town Center. Surprise, surprise, Ray is actively looking at a couple of sites in Washington D.C. and chasing some built-to-suit opportunities there. Given his track record of success we are optimistic about. And then, obviously, in San Francisco, I think that what our development platform looks like today is probably a good place for you to think about what our activities will look like in the near future. There are some things going on in New York City that we're not going to really talk about, where there are, obviously, sites that could be redeveloped or additional density could be added to, current buildings that might make for terrific buildings in Midtown. And so we are aggressively pursuing those types of endeavors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Mike, I was wondering if you can just give a little more color on the occupancy forecast for next year, I think you said 92.5% to 93.5%, that's a year end '14 number?","Michael E. LaBelle","That's an average during the year number. So as Doug mentioned, and as I mentioned, we're losing 550,000 square feet during the year. But we've got opportunities for lease up and the activity is strong in some of the other places. Where Bay Colony is, you can see this quarter we're up to about 72%, but there's a lot to still lease there. And we're seeing great activities, so we're going to see upticks there. In New York City at both 510 and 540, again, this quarter doesn't look like we did much leasing. Because it just -- the stuff we've done over the last one or two quarters hasn't started yet. So we have signed leases but they haven't started yet. So they're not in our supplemental, plus we continue to see good activity. So the numbers that Doug gave of being at 80%, with the deals we have signed and being at 90% in those buildings during 2014 are very achievable kinds of numbers. And when you look at Embarcadero Center, where we don't have a lot of vacancy, but we've got a letter of intent that we're working on, that Doug mentioned, on 2.5 floors at EC4, which will probably take us from 96% to 98% or something there. And then in Reston, we continue to lease up with the big transaction that Doug talked about, which is going to add to our occupancy there. So I mean, it's really everywhere. I think we're doing really, really well. And obviously, you have these move outs every once in a while and you got some downtime. The Blue Cross Blue Shield, 300,000 Square feet, we have that lease. We know that income is coming in 2015. But we're just going to be down by 300,000 square feet in '14 and lose $10 million of '14 on a temporary basis.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you guys feel better about the direction your markets are heading in. Did you feel like your sentiment today is better than what you would have thought 6 months ago, 9 months ago?","Douglas T. Linde","I would say that our macro sentiment remains the same. I think that we've seen a consistency in the demand in our buildings, in our markets. And remember that I don't think you can, for example, look at our portfolio in Midtown Manhattan where our availability has been, which is the high-end market of above $90 a square foot as the Manhattan market, right. I mean, it's an important subset and submarket in Manhattan. But for us, it's been consistent for the last 6 months. So I don't think there's been a strong change in our view. San Francisco is, again, as I had described, really pretty consistent with what we saw in 2010 and 2011 and 2012. And so we're very comfortable with the sort of the meat that's behind the demand there in that marketplace. So it's -- I think, it's a sort of status quo with -- on the increment things, things still feel good, not frothy and not depressed.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Yes. I'm going to just add one general comment, because this goes back to our fundamental strategy which is to have the highest-quality buildings in the highest quality locations and in the best markets. And frankly, these kinds of buildings have done really well, it seems to me, in this current environment. When you think about the overall macro environment, I think we have continued to do very well in our leasing. We think, we're going to continue to do well in our leasing. So I think we are very comfortable in our position. I mean, I don't think we expect there's going to be a bull market in everything, but I think we're going continue to do well.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I can just ask about a little more color on the maybe the magnitude of the D.C. relocations that you're going to be dealing with, that Ray is going to be dealing with and his team there?","Owen D. Thomas","Michael, we've got 3 major leases that we're focusing on. And believe it or not, these leases don\u2019t expire until '17, 2 of them '17, and then 1 of them in '19. Jon Kaylor in our D.C. office was quite ingenious when he structured a renewable lease that forces the 19 Kirkland and Ellis at Met Square to exercise a renewal option in '15 to make some space becoming available. So we're already focusing on that lease, that we're looking to consolidate 200,000 square feet on top of Met Square. And those of you who have visited the building know it is probably the best place in the city. So we're very optimistic about that one. We're renewing, hopefully, Finnegan at 901 New York. That's roughly 220,000 square feet, expires in '17, we've in active discussions with them. And lastly, at 1330 Connecticut, we have got Steptoe & Johnson, getting into 220,000 square feet. We're in active discussions with them, down between to stay put and a possible relocation. But we reserved 50,000 square feet in the building we own directly across the street to give them optimal swing space. So to facilitate the relocation in place. So I say we're looking very good shape in all 3. Again, consistent with our past philosophy, we're way out in part of these leases before they get the new car smell of moving to the new building. So we're pretty optimistic about keeping all 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Doug, a smart guy in your D.C. office once said to me that, \"A tenants pay a rents for a product.\" And what appears to be happening in all these markets is excluding the hedge funds and looking at your rank-and-file law firms, defense contractors, financial service, tech tenants, they're willing to pay certain price for a good product in a good location, and then that demand almost falls off and that they've got a ceiling in terms of what they're going to pay. Do you have a sense for, in these various markets, the demand goes from reasonably strong to very thin at some certain price point?","Douglas T. Linde","I think you're asking the question sort of what's the size of the demand at the high-end in these marketplaces, and I'll say...","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I would say not the hedge fund type high-end, but the law firms, tech firms, the financial service, who want to be in good quality space and they're willing to pay up to a certain price, but then all of a sudden, they just say, \"It's not in my budget. I can't pay it.\"","Douglas T. Linde","Yes, see, the interesting thing, John, I think is that that's not the conversation that those people are having. Particularly, with regard to the technology firms, they're going to pay the market price to be in the kind of buildings that they want to be in for the mature companies, and there's -- I mean, I could describe a million square feet of leases that are getting done right now in San Francisco, where the rent effectively is in the high-$50s low-$60s, starting with dollar increases every year, and most of the tenants are paying their own electric, and that's sort of -- that's the going rent for those types of buildings. The Cambridge market, again, there's no availability. So they will pay what is necessary to be there. The high-end in Manhattan, I think is very strong from a demand perspective, but it's a small marketplace. And so if you're patient, you will get your price. The question is how long it will take you to achieve enough demand to fill up the buildings. And as we've seen with 510 Madison, our pricing has been very consistent for the past 2-plus years. And we're filling up the building, and we're getting more than our fair share of the market demand, but it's not a universe of millions of square feet of space. It's 750,000 to 1 million square feet of overall demand year-in, year out, and that's been the case for the last 3 years. So that's where the market is.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay, then the second question, and I think it's -- and correct me if I'm wrong on these numbers. But I think your total development cost at Transbay are fairly reasonable at $700 to $725 a square foot, but correct me if I'm wrong. And to get a 7% yield on that, you really only need only maybe $75 gross and $50 to $55 net, which are numbers that are being achieved along California Street, and in Embarcadero for the better product. First, are those numbers reasonably correct? And then the second question is that California Street still has a surprisingly large amount of parking, and the Mission Street market is surprisingly void of parking. Is that going to be a hindrance in moving people from the traditional financial district to the Mission Street market?","Douglas T. Linde","So I'll answer the first part of the question, and I'll let Bob Pester answer the question regarding parking. We have assumed about $1 billion for total project cost and it's $1.4 billion. So you can do the math, it's 710 bucks a square-foot, something like that, for our overall cost, and that's a number that includes the cost of capital associated with our equity, as well as a lease-up period of time that's pretty extended given the size of the building. And I think your rents are slightly low, largely due to the fact that we are in a Mello-Roos bond district, which means our taxes will be slightly higher than a building that's outside of that area. So you have to factor that into the numbers. Rents at the top buildings at the higher end are being -- deals are being achieved now in the sort of low-70s to the mid-80s for relocations and renewals. So we're very optimistic that, as I said before, the velocity of deals is going to pick up in that sort of higher end, I mean, that we're going to be able to attract both the traditional financial services companies, as well as some of the nontraditional, but very important and now becoming market growers in the mature technology companies into Transbay. So Bob, you can talk about the parking.","Bryan J. Koop","Obviously, the more parking that you can have in San Francisco, the better. Mission Street clearly is not going to have the parking that you see in the traditional South or North market office buildings based on current zoning. We think the advantage is being next to the transit center and the potential for the Caltrain hook up and also for BART far outweighs the diminished parking that will be in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Wanted to just talk about New York for a second. It was reported in one of the local papers that you guys were in the running for 1 Chase Plaza at some point, and I'm just curious about your thoughts on sort of the Downtown market, and what the potential play might be for an asset like that","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","I'll take a shot at that. We really were never in serious contention for 1 Chase. That was just not the kind of real estate that we thought was sort of in our sweet spot. So I have to start off with that. Look, I think the downtown market is going to be a function, obviously, of the financial world, and the financial and the legal world associated with it, and it's hard really to be able to project that market because, in part, as we all know, technology is having a big effect on some of those firms, both the financial firms and the law firms. We have always stayed primarily in the midtown market, where we feel we can build the quality of buildings that has been in our traditional mode and that we can do well in terms of both the buildings that we offer and the management that we offer. I think that will still be the predominant focus of our activities. It doesn't mean that we're not going to be willing to look at other sites because, frankly, we're going to be opportunistic. It all depends on what we think is a specific site, and its specific attraction. But as a general rule, I think we're going to stay in the Midtown market, where we have done so well and continue to do very well. Our buildings are doing are very, very well here. We think we're going continue to do well here, and this is where I think we're going to continue to focus.","Owen D. Thomas","Just to add to what Mort said, and Doug's comments earlier in the call, the downtown market is highly competitive from a leasing standpoint, given the standing vacancy. And I think for the buyers for 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, it's clearly a value play that the reported price on the sale was $725 million at the 2.2 million square foot building. That's $330 a square foot. We sold a 45% interest in Times Square Tower in Midtown for over $1,200 a square foot. So clearly, a value play has got to be the thesis for the group that bought it.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then as it relates to construction costs, you guys are obviously doing quite a bit of development. Curious as to sort of your thoughts on construction cost going forward and how you're sort of underwriting them, and then just return expectations along the same lines for development?","Owen D. Thomas","So on the construction side, it's interesting, it's -- a part of it's very much market dependent, right? I mean because labor is such an important and critical factor in a lot of construction. And so while we're seeing some creep in San Francisco, and we're seeing some amount of creep in markets like Cambridge and Boston just given sort of the number of cranes in the sky and the amount of apartments that are currently being conceived of and ultimately started. A market like Washington D.C., we just priced and finished our lump sum numbers at 601 Mass Avenue, and they were slightly below what we were projecting. So we felt -- I mean, we feel really good about sort of the cost control views that we have on the hard cost associated with buildings like that and markets like that because there's just less going on. With regards to our return expectations, that's a tough one. It's very much dependent upon where we view overall interest rates at a point in time, where we view the risk on the lease-up and where we view the quality of the credit demand associated with the building, and it's going to change. Is the number going to be 10% today. God, I wish I could tell you that, but it's just not -- it's not achievable. Most of the deals that we are looking at have a overall cash-on-cash returns fully loaded in the mid-single digits. So that's from the high-6s to the low-8s. I mean, that's sort of where things are being projected from a conceptual perspective. We may do better than that. We may do slightly worse than that, depending upon where leasing ultimately turns out. And obviously, in those locations, where we have embedded land value that's really in at 0 in terms of what is on our balance sheet, what it actually shows up at from a return on cost. When we deliver to you, it is actually going to be higher than that. But when we think about how we're pricing our rents, we try and assume what the market value of that land is, not what our basis is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Doug, the law firm consolidation stuff's back in the news again. I mean, how much of threat do you guys view that to the business in the sort of short and intermediate term?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, I -- Rob, it's Owen Thomas. The -- I think the consolidation or the -- what I'd call densification of law firms is, I think, clearly been demonstrated in the marketplace. A very have percentage of law firms that are renewing their leases are either they're renewing in their existing buildings or moving. They're downsizing and grasping various technology benefits in the use of their space. In terms of consolidation of law firms themselves, I suppose that is a theoretical risk. I'm not sure that's as big an issue as it is, simply the downsizing of law firms when they are moving.","Douglas T. Linde","One of the things that's obviously going on in the legal industry is that every firm is dramatically changing the way that they're using space and doing their work, and there are 2 things, 2 sort of -- 2 primary thing to consider. One is that many firms are outsourcing what we would refer to as sort of the administrative function to lower cost environments, and those -- that is not Boston, Washington D.C, San Francisco or New York. And so as that happens, if there is a consolidation, what is going to be left in the cities where they're consolidating? As an example, right now, they're talking -- there's a rumor on the mill that's 2 firms in San Francisco, Pillsbury and Orrick, are looking at merging. Pillsbury just moved into Embarcadero Center, and they are using their space, and fully utilizing all of their space. And our understanding is that, Orrick, which did bring something similarly a few years ago in foundry has gotten very little space because, quite frankly, both of these firms have sort of gone through the first stages of the corporate densification that Owen just described. So if they merge together, unless they are looking to cut the actual number of lawyers who are practicing in those firms because they don't think that they need them anymore, we don't see a lot of \"space utilization risk\" in the future from those types of operations. It's very possible that a decade from now, technology will have changed again, and there will be another change in the way law firms are utilizing space. We think that there is very little shadow availability within any law firm that has done a lease in the last, call it, 4 or 5 years, certainly, the deals that are being done right now. And in fact, in many of the transactions that we have done, we've actually seen our law firms take a little bit of incremental space after they sign the original lease because they were being a little bit too cost-conscious with regards to how much space they were using. But again, that's because they've driven things down by 25% or 30% in terms of the overall utilization of space that they have in their newer installations.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one for Mike. What's the thinking on the timing of the potential special dividend? And do you have any slack in the regular dividend to the extent to where if you guys did acquisition, but it wasn't enough to cover the full Times Square gains that you could accommodate some of that in the regular dividend and not have to pay a special?","Michael E. LaBelle","With regard to the timing, we're going to decide the timing over the next kind of 30 to 45 days. It's possible it could get paid this year. It's possible it will be paid early next year. And like I said, we're going to be discussing that and talking about it. With regard to having a smaller acquisition have an impact, it's unlikely. You got to eat through so much first before you can actually get the benefit. So it would have to be a pretty large acquisition in order to be able to do the 1031, and the identification data's in mid-November. So it's coming right up. And as Owen mentioned, we don't -- we haven't identified anything right now necessarily. So I mean, I think our view is it's pretty unlikely that we're going to be able to shelter any of that, which is why we've been talking about the potential for the $2.25 dividend if we don't find anything at this point. Does that answer all of your questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The first question is on the retail space, 2 parts. One is, obviously, there's still some retail space available at the base of 510. But just more broadly, are you guys -- if the office market may not be as robust as we wish, are you guys seeing more opportunity in the ability to drive rents out of your retail space, especially, just given some of the recent flag trip -- flagship pricing trades that have occurred?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll try and answer this, and allow others to chime in if they want. So we have a retail space, which is a restaurant space at 510 Madison Avenue, and we are being, I'd say, very thoughtful about the overall image and use of that space. There are a number of transactions we could have done that we've chosen not to do because we just didn't think it was the right thing for the building and tenancy in the building and the image that it might bring to the 305,000 square feet of other space that is being leased in the building. With regards to our portfolio, I think that as we look at 3 or 4 different places, right, the Reston Town Center and Embarcadero Center, and the Prudential Center, there's obviously a very significant retail component to all of those, and clearly, enhancing the retail demand and the ability for retailers to generate large sales, which will obviously lead to them being prepared to pay large rents, it's critically important to us. I mean, it's something we spend a lot of time on. And then the other major asset, obviously, is the General Motors Building, 767 Fifth Avenue, where we did our deal with Ridgemont [ph], and the Toys 'R' Us lease is expiring in another 2 years, I believe. And there's going to be a major rethinking of how that space is used and by whom. And we think, obviously, it's got a tremendous amount of embedded opportunity. I think the Toys 'R' Us leases are fair -- probably a fair representation of what the current income is for a portion of that space. So I'm not sure there's tremendous amount of additional embedded growth there, but we certainly think that we can maintain something very similar to what we're currently getting there.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, and then the second question is with regards to the TD Boston Garden mix use development that you guys are contemplating in Boston, how do you envision the development program as far as would you be willing to undertake that at the same time that you have 250 finishing up and Transbay is still sort of in process as far as doing foundation? Or would you want to see Transbay really pre-leased and set to go before tackling another major development investment?","Douglas T. Linde","I think the implicit question you're asking is there -- do we have a tolerance for any amount of available space that we want to build at any one time right?","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes, I guess, Doug, that's a much better way of saying it then.","Douglas T. Linde","So my answer is that I think it's something that we certainly think about overall given our portfolio, but we also have to consider what we're actually going to be having rolling over at any one point in time. So if we had 3 million square feet of additional space rolling over in those markets, adding to the available inventory vacancy might not necessarily be a good thing. But if, in fact, we have very little space rolling over in those markets and maybe a risk and an opportunity even more importantly that we wanted to pursue. With regard to the TD north Garden site, in particular, I think it's a slightly different animal, and that the base of the building, knock on wood we get our permits, is going to be primarily anchored retail, where we will have lead tenant demand in place before we even start. And then there are 3 towers that are being contemplated. One of them is a residential tower, which I think, at this point, we are -- we would probably have a strong desire to be involved with on an ownership basis. There's a hotel, where I think the jury is out as to whether or not it's something we want to do and how that would get done. And then there is an office building component and there's low-rise office building component and a tower office component, and the tower is not being contemplated as part of the original phase. So the amount of office space that might be built there at the base is pretty limited. It's 200,000 square of feet space. So I don't think that the overall impact on what's going on at the North Station site is really impacted by the sort of original question that you asked.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So if I understand correctly, there's the base, the lead retail that would be once you get that signed, you would proceed, and it sounds like, obviously, apartments in Boston, assuming that market is good, you'd proceed, but then the office part would be something that would be out in later year? So it wouldn't be part of the initial phase, is that correct?","Douglas T. Linde","Correct, the tower office would be in later year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First on 250 West 55th, could you provide a feel for the lease durations? And more specifically, the conversations with the tenants, is there any element of granting lower rents in return for longer lease terms? Or is it more the best of both worlds for you and that tenants are willing to pay higher rents for the prime real estate even when they sign on for the long-term?","Douglas T. Linde","So we -- the 2 leases that we've done are both 20 years, and the 2 leases that we're negotiating, I believe one is 15 and one is 20. So for a building like this, doing a long duration lease is sort of the norm. I will tell you that we believe that the utility of the building, the efficiency of the building, the volume of space that we are providing our tenants is allowing us to get a rent that is a premium to the similar sized spaces in the upper west side market of Midtown Manhattan. In other words, the rents that we are -- we believe we are going to achieve and that we are achieving are rents that are a premium to what you could achieve on 6th Avenue or on 7th Avenue or on 8th Avenue in the other existing inventory in the marketplace.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great color. And then could you also just describe your conversations with NRG, leading up to the build-to-suit? I'm just curious on the read across, if any, to New Jersey real estate. Were they unable to find anything even with relatively high vacancies out there that fit their needs?","Douglas T. Linde","Do you want to take that one?","Michael E. LaBelle","Sure. The real answer is that they want it to be under one roof. They currently lease in 3 different leases from us, spaces in 2 buildings, and they were looking to both expand, as Doug mentioned, by about 40,000 feet and put all employees under one roof.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the development conversation regarding sort of the risk tolerance. It sounds like the overall availability, including existing stock, is a big factor obviously. But just curious, you're at about 10%, 11% of gross assets. I'm just wondering, how high would you let that go before just saying it's too much in terms of development risk? And then I got a follow up after that.","Douglas T. Linde","We've never had a bright line test. It's really -- again, it's sort of, it factors back to the availability in those buildings. So if we could build 5 million square feet of buildings that were leased to credit tenants, we would have absolutely no tolerance for surpassing the 10% and going to 20% or 25% because of the comfort level that we have with regard to the risks associated with development, managing construction, doing permitting, dealing with financing and then ultimately knowing that we have tenancies. So it's really a question of the speculative nature of that pipeline, I think, that is the more sort of pressing question. And again, I have to go back to what I said previously, which is it's really a question of what the rest of our portfolio looks like and how we feel about the overall availability of space in each individual market relative to what our particular availability is in our portfolio in that market and how comfortable we are at that -- at any one point in time with that equation.","Owen D. Thomas","The other thing I would add, Doug, is we have $2.5 billion underway right now, but $1.5 billion of this is delivering. It's basically constructed. 680 Folsom is effectively leased, one of the residential projects, and then we talked about 250, where we've got it over 70% committed, and we think it's going to be stabilizing over the next kind of 12 to 18 months. So that's going to be rolling off. And so there's opportunity for us to replace that with the new opportunities that we've been talking about, and I don\u2019t think that we're necessarily limited by the opportunities that we could put potentially have.","Douglas T. Linde","Yes. And also, I'd just to point out, for example, the TD site in Boston is a partnership. So it's not 100% Boston properties, which I think is also a factor.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That actually was my next sort of question was just with the 250, West 55th and about half -- almost half of the pipeline delivering relatively soon, and I know you don't want to give too much detail on what the shadow pipeline looks like, but can you give us a sense of the magnitude? Are there enough projects in there that could replace that $1 billion within a reasonable timeframe?","Douglas T. Linde","Within a reasonable timeframe, absolutely, yes.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that being within 6 months?","Douglas T. Linde","No, I mean, come one, this is -- development is a long-term process, right. So I mean, we have well in excess of $1 billion or $2 billion of potential deals that we have control over right now. And I think the question is how long does it take us to sort of lay that stuff out. And then, additionally, as Mort described, there are other things that we're looking at, which would be incremental to that. So if there were a site, as an example, in Manhattan, you're talking about likely a $750 million to $1 billion development right there. So these are chunky projects. If we are lucky enough to get a lead tenant for our building at 888 Boylston Street, that's another 450,000 square foot project, which has got a significant cost associated with it. So again, there are lots of opportunities within the portfolio that we currently control that can replace that development portion that Mike talked about that sort of -- it's not really rolling off. It's rolling into income, which is obviously a good thing.","Mort, I don\u2019t know if you have any closing remarks you want to make?","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","No. I just think that we pretty much covered the waterfront, and as you know, again, we have to underscore the fact that this is still an opportunistic business and an entrepreneurial business, and you just never know what's going to come up and we're still going to be open to these kinds of opportunities if they do come up. That's just been the hallmark of what we've done for all these years, and we hope that it's going to continue. But we also are aware and you've heard a number of us, including myself, express some wariness about the overall macro environment, and we take that very seriously into account. The one benefit of that, that we have been able to capitalize on, of course, is the record-low interest rates, and we intend to look at our portfolio in every way to take advantage of that, and that will still, I think, be an advantage to us as we look forward to financing or refinancing assets or developing assets because we can put together the kind of financing at rates that, frankly, we have never seen before, and that really does change the risk portfolio as we look forward to what we might or might not do.","Douglas T. Linde","Okay, just one last comment. So most of us will be in beautiful San Francisco in 2.5 weeks for NAREIT, and we are going to attempt to get a gathering together, where we can talk a little bit more about our San Francisco project specifically when we're out there. So look for a notice of that over the next week or so. So we can hopefully get as many of you as possible to get a little bit more first-hand understanding of the Folsom Street project, 535 Mission, as well as the Transbay project. Very good. Thanks a lot, and we'll see you in a couple of weeks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties Conference Call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a great day.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning and welcome to Boston Properties second quarter earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with the Reg G requirements. If you did not receive a copy these documents are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.BostonProperties.com. An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the investor relations section of our website.","At this time we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Wednesday's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Having said that, I would like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, Doug Linde, President, and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As we have done in prior quarters, I will provide an update on how we're viewing the economy and its impacts on our business, our resultant capital allocation approach and progress and some high-level remarks on the quarter. Doug will then provide an overview of our operations followed by Mike who will wrap up with a more detailed financial summary of the quarter.","In particular this morning we intend to highlight specific investment decisions we have made and the resultant tenant activity which will have an impact on our 2016 and 2017 results. So starting with the environment, economic performance in the U.S. continues to unfold the way we have described in previous quarters. Economic growth is steady but modest as first-quarter U.S. GDP declined 0.2% but is forecast to be a positive 2.4% for all of 2015. Unemployment has dropped to 5.3% at the end of June but the underemployment rate remains stubbornly high at a little over 11%.","Economic growth has translated into office net absorption for the second quarter in the U.S. of approximately 15 million square feet and 1.1% of stock for the last year. Technology and life sciences driven markets continue to lead the pack in terms of positive absorption. Office construction continues to increase as well with 2.1% of current stock under construction versus a long term average of 1.9%.","The capital market landscape has remained fairly benign as well. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has risen approximately 30 basis points since our last call but remains at a historically low level of 2.3%. We and market consensus continue to expect the Fed to increase rates later this year which has stoked cap rate expansion fears and driven capital flows out of REITs, $4.8 billion from U.S. mutual funds and ETFs so far this year with a resultant negative impact on share price performance for Boston Properties and the entire sector.","REIT valuation declines are not consistent with the current private market for real estate assets where investor enthusiasm remains robust. We continue to see positive rent growth, a significant yield gap and the potential for an appreciating dollar attracting both domestic and non-U.S. investors to high quality office assets in our core markets. Aggressive asset pricing including for our own sales continue to exist in our core markets.","So in summary on the environment, we continue to believe capital values are more advanced in the cycle than underlying fundamentals and see more upside driven by operating fundamentals and further cap rate compression. So logically we're more actively investing in our capital and new developments rather than existing acquisitions. Further, we're taking advantage of private market pricing by funding development activity through targeted asset sales.","Now moving to the specifics on our capital strategy execution for the quarter, we continue to be active at measured in the pursuit of acquisitions. We're focused on sites and redevelopments in our core markets and though pricing is a challenge, we're having some success as demonstrated by the new investments which I will describe in a moment.","We're also looking at acquisitions of high quality existing buildings in partnership with private capital providers given the opportunity to enhance our returns through compensation earned for providing real estate skills to targeted assets.","On dispositions, we announced this week that a contract has been executed for the sale of 505 9th St. in the Washington DC CBD. This 325,000 square foot Class A building was broadly marketed globally and is under contract with a domestic investor for $318 million which represents pricing of $977 per square foot and a 4.4% forward NOI cap rate.","The buyer is assuming $117 million of above market debt which when factored into the valuation, brings the price to in excess of $1000 per square foot and an even lower effective yield. Boston Properties owns 50% of the building and generated a 16% unleveraged and a 30% leveraged return on the development for shareholders.","We're also continuing to reduce our Montgomery County, Maryland activities with a second land parcels sale expected in the third quarter at Washingtonian North for $13 million. With these sales plus the already completed sale of The Avenue in Washington DC, we will have completed or contracted for total dispositions of $377 million measured as our share and remain on track for targeted total dispositions of $750 million for 2015.","As mentioned, we continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. We were able to launch three new development projects in the second quarter.","The most significant new development we recently announced is Dock 72, a 670,000 square foot, 16-story building located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a 50% partnership with Rudin Management. The building is 33% preleased to WeWork for 20 years, will cost $410 million to develop and is scheduled for delivery in the first half of 2018.","The land is leased from the Brooklyn Navy Yard for 96 years with modest levels of ground rent and given the land is owned by the City of New York, all tenants are exempt from real estate taxes and sales tax on leasehold improvements.","Further, tenants located in Brooklyn are exempt from commercial occupancy tax and can qualify for business relocation benefits. With these incentives, we can lease the balance of the building at around $60 a square foot and achieve an unleveraged initial NOI yield in access of our target of 7% for office developments.","Boston Properties will manage and be paid development fees for the construction of the building and we will jointly lease and manage the property post completion with Rudin Management. Through this investment, we will be expanding our business to an exciting new district in New York City of great interest to technology and creative tenants and expanding our relationship with WeWork, one of the fastest-growing office tenants in the United States.","Further, we think the Dock 72 investment could lead to additional development opportunities for Boston Properties at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and in Brooklyn more broadly.","This past quarter we also announced the development of 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 50% partnership with the current owner of this former Polaroid site. 1265 Main is a three-story, 115,000 square foot building that will undergo a complete redevelopment at a cost of $52 million including site acquisition. The development is 100% preleased to Clark Shoes and is forecast to generate in excess of a 7% unleveraged NOI yield on cost were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Though these size of the 1265 Main Street development is modest for us, the investment secures our opportunity to develop up to an additional 1 million square feet of commercial space on a site immediately to the south and adjacent to our CityPoint portfolio. Boston Properties will now effectively control 90% of the East Route 128 frontage between exits 26 and 27 with opportunities to create transit connections between the new development and our existing Waltham assets.","Lastly, we're redeveloping Reservoir Place North, a 35-year-old, 73,000 square foot building we own adjacent to Reservoir Place in Waltham which was vacated earlier this year. We expect to generate in excess of a 7% unlevered NOI return on the $25 million of incremental costs required to convert the building to a Class A facility. Reservoir Place North is an example of existing portfolio investment opportunities that exist for us in strengthening markets such as Waltham.","With these three new projects, our active development pipeline now consists of 14 projects representing 4.2 million square feet with our share of total projected cost of $2.4 billion. We forecast these projects, currently 59% preleased, will generate over a 7% cash NOI yield upon completion over the next four plus years and we have all the capital required to complete these developments with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash currently on our balance sheet.","We have now commenced $486 million on a gross basis of new projects for 2015 and continue to target $1 billion in new starts for the year. As described in the past, we have a large number of projects in our pre-development pipeline which could still be launched in 2015 including the first and podium phase of North Station consisting of 360,000 square feet of retail and loft space located adjacent to the TD Garden in Boston, a 160,000 square foot residential development located in our Kendall Center project in Cambridge, a 600,000 square foot residential and retail development located in our Reston Town Center project, three different potential office build-to-suit opportunities in the Washington DC region representing in the aggregate over 1.3 million square feet, as well as significant improvement projects at 601 Lexington Avenue in New York and 100 Federal Street in Boston, both of which will enhance and add high value retail amenities to the building.","The next wave of development will include a significant allocation to multifamily projects where we anticipate the initial yields to be closer to 6% than the 7% initial cash NOI yield we have been able to achieve on our office projects.","Moving to results for the second quarter, we continue to perform well and as I described earlier, we have made strong progress towards executing our goals. As you know, our diluted FFO for the first quarter was $1.36 per share which is above our forecast and consensus. We're also increasing our full year guidance and Mike will take you through those details. We had an active quarter in leasing having completed 88 deals representing 1 million square feet with balance across all of our four major markets. And the occupancy of our in-service properties increased to 91.1% from 90.3%.","So let me turn over the discussion to Doug for a review of our operations.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody. My commentary on the general market conditions in our four core markets is going to sound really pretty consistent with what we have described in the last few quarters.","Boston, both the suburbs, the city and Cambridge, New York City, San Francisco they are all really healthy markets and they are all characterized by strong demand coming from new economy companies although there seems to be more and more [indiscernible] type users as well accompanied by stable supply characteristics and it is all resulting in improving real estate economics which I think are flowing through our numbers as you saw in our second-generation statistics this quarter.","And then DC CBD continues to work through its densification issues in the relatively modest amount of new demand generators there and then Northern Virginia really continues to be a story of both strong and weak markets. The good news is we predominantly are in the strongest markets.","As I discussed the operating portfolio this quarter, I think I'm going to spend some time providing some specific expectations on sort of some of the larger moving parts in the portfolio, the major vacancy upcoming rollover and discuss some of a pretty meaningful property-specific investment and leasing decisions that we're making right now all with the goal of foreshadowing our 2016 same-store portfolio. I hope this is going to provide a pretty good backdrop to the earnings guidance that Mike is going to provide for 2016 in October.","Our overall leasing activity in the second quarter dropped off a little bit from the first quarter but was really pretty much in line with the average that we have been hitting for each second quarter for the last 10 years which is about 1 million square feet. Again, the second-generation leasing stats were dominated by Boston and San Francisco.","I think they are probably a little bit higher than you might have expected in Boston, up 30% on a net basis and that is really stemming from the impact that we're starting to see as the lease at 200 Clarendon Street which was formerly referred to as the Hancock Tower but we're not allowed to call it that in a longer since the Hancoc's lease expired at the beginning of the second quarter.","As well as there was lease commencement at 101 Huntington Ave. with Blue Cross Blue Shield which was over 300,000 square feet which had a big pop as well. In San Francisco as you saw, we're up 41% while the contributions from Embarcadero Center specifically was up over 60%. Statistically New York City was pretty limited, there was only 36,000 square feet in total and about half of that was from Princeton. Then in DC, we had pretty strong rollup in Reston and then really flat results in the CBD and our other markets.","I'm going to begin my specific market comments this morning on Midtown Manhattan. So it really continues to be a very healthy market, solid leasing activity but as we have said in the past with 10% availability and lots of uncommitted new construction, rental rate increases have been pretty modest, really moderated. We're seeing heavy traffic across our entire portfolio but if you look at our occupancy statistics, we have very limited current availability so most of our negotiations are revolving around future availability.","The one exception to this is obviously at 250 W. 55th Street where this quarter we completed eight more leases ranging from 4000 square feet prebuilt suites to a floor and half square foot lease. We're 89% leased, we have two prebuilt suites and three full floors in the top quarter of the building to go. Our asking rents are from the low $90s to well over $100 a square foot for those full floors remaining at the top of the building.","At 599 Lexington, in order to speed up the rebuilding process from the tenants that we renewed last year, we have three non-revenue producing swing floors that are all currently occupied but will be unavailable for revenue until the end of 2016. We have leases under negotiation on two of those floors and activity on the third.","At 399 Park, there are two major lease expirations in 2017, 190,000 square foot block in the midrise, this if you recall is adjacent to 150,000 square foot block that we got back in 2016 and we released to four separate tenants in six months the entire block. There we have expiring rents of about $100 a square foot and we expect to get rents well over that.","And then we have the Citi space at 399 which is really in the three blocks. We have a 280,000 square foot block at the base, 97,000 square feet in the midrise and about 110,000 square feet below grade. The above grade space has a current rent of about $90 a square foot and we expect to be pretty close to that and discussions are already underway with more than 300,000 square feet of that 2017 rollover.","At 601 Lexington Avenue, we announced a few quarters ago that Citi would be terminating its lease on about 170,000 square feet in April of 2016. Three of those floors were in the Tower and two of those floors were in the low rise building which is floors three through six. We have now leased the entire Tower block, 90,000 square feet, though rent is not going to commence on 60,000 square feet until 2017 and we're in the planning stages of a major repositioning of the retail and the low rise of 601 which I think we introduced at our investor meeting a year ago and we're working on a plan to vacate the entire 140,000 square foot office building including the 70,000 square feet that is under long term lease to the Citi.","This would result in additional 2016 and 2017 vacancy as we renovate this portion of the complex. With virtually no vacancy at 601, what our New York team is doing right now is trying to find ways where we can actually control currently leased space so we can move tenants around and move forward with these plans. This is very high contribution space and it is going to result in a diminution of our 2016 occupancy and revenue. But consistent with our core strategy and philosophy, we're making decisions with a long term view of maximizing the value of individual assets in the portfolio and this is the opportune time to take advantage of what we can do at 601.","Last quarter, we commented on the possible early termination of FAO. This will occur on August 1 as part of an agreement we reached with an existing tenant to use the FAO space on a temporary basis as they reconfigure their existing operations. As we look forward to 2016, the net contribution from this space will be suboptimal.","We made the decision to accelerate the lease expiration and forfeit a portion of FAO's rent for 2016 in order to accommodate this tenant's requirement and set up the GM retail for even stronger future performance.","The FAO space is over 60,000 square feet, 14,000 square feet on the ground floor, 34,000 square feet on the second floor with 20 foot ceiling heights and 11,000 square feet of Concourse space. This city block has among the highest pedestrian traffic counts on Fifth Avenue and historically the FAO foot fall has nearly matches that of the Apple Store. The FAO space will go through a major renovation and downtime as part of any releasing which will likely occur in 2017 and we will greatly increase the contribution thereafter.","Switching to DC, so this quarter I think the headline news from all the brokers reports was that the DC had positive absorption after a number of quarters of negative activity and while this is certainly a positive change, the District continues to be very competitive since there hasn't been much in the way of significant demand increases and in fact the real interesting overhang today revolves actually around the massive amount of GSA related expirations. Nearly half of all leased GSA space in the Metro area rolls between 2015 and 2017 and the GSA has mandated densification.","How is this really going to work? It is really one thing to require on paper an agency to reduce its space per employee by 10% or 20% or in some cases 40% which is what they mandated, but with specialized uses in many installations and the capital requirements necessary to build space or move tenants, we will really see what actually happens.","The one wholly-owned building in our portfolio with a near-term major law firm expiration is at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and we're actively engaged in lease extension negotiations there. Our development that 601 Mass is on schedule. It is actually going to open up early, likely in September and the office space is 83% leased. The income contribution will ramp up significantly in 2016.","In the rest of our portfolio as Ray is prone to say, we're in hand-to-hand on the availability at our JV assets that Market Square North and it 901 New York Avenue and at Met Square where we may be losing some occupancy in 2016 but we will gain it back.","Reston Town Center continues to be the best-performing market in our region as well as in Northern Virginia. It has a vacancy rate under 3% while the overall Reston marketplace is over 14%. Roslyn is at over 30% and Tyson is at 18.","During the first quarter, we negotiated the recapture of 55,000 square feet of our Overlook property in order to provide expansion to a growing tenant. This quarter we gained control of an additional 55,000 square feet and that same tenant grabbed it again on a long term basis. ","The combination of walkable retail, high quality new multifamily, community programming and improving access to Metro continue to draw tenants to the Town Center. Small tenant demand is strong, we did eight more renewals and expansions this quarter and many of our smaller tenants are now expanding.","Switching to the Boston market, lack of available supply continues to be the story in Cambridge. Every week there seems to be another article describing a Cambridge company with growth requirements that is unable to find space in Kendall Square. The question is how is this trend going to impact other markets? Well these companies are migrating to the back bay, to downtown, to the seaport and in some cases to the suburbs. But in any case, Kendall Square continues to dramatically outperform the rest of the urban Boston market with rents above $70 a square foot.","Our Cambridge portfolio as we have said before is essentially 100% leased and we don't have any short-term availability but there are a large number of expansion requirements in the market. We're working with the city of an upzoning of our Kendall Square project to add 600,000 square feet of office density and about 400,000 square feet of multifamily. This filing is likely to occur sometime this summer.","The GSA recently issued its plan outlining the timing for the disposal of the Volpe transportation site and it now suggests an award in early 2017 which means no additional supply from this site for four to five years.","One note of importance as you think about our portfolio in Cambridge on a going forward basis is to remember that we previously announced that MIT has exercised the fixed-price option that we negotiated in 2002 to purchase 7 Cambridge Center. It is going to occur on February 1 and it is going to result in the reduction of about $13.3 million in 2016 comparable to 2015.","In the Back Bay, our repositioning and our rebranding at 120 St. James where we have 170,000 square feet of availability was completed last week and we had our first formal presentation and I think the reaction was fabulous. Our asking rents on this space are significantly lower than in Cambridge, they are 40% higher than our original underwriting in 2011 and the mark to market that we expect to get on this space is 60% higher than the expiring rent.","The 150,000 square foot block at the top of the Hancock Tower is still under lease until the middle of the summer. While it is certainly available to show, it is really not in very good shape and it probably won't be until the end of the year. Realistically we're not likely to see rent commencement on these two big blocks until the very end of 2016 or early 2017. I think we will do some leasing in 2016, we may even do some leasing in 2015 but from a rent commencement perspective, not likely until 2016 or 2017.","The incremental contribution from the available space of this building is going to be over $25 million. Similar to New York City, the occupancy has a much higher contribution than our average current weighted rent of about $55 a square foot across the portfolio.","At 888 Boylston Street, we signed another full floor least. We're now 258,000 square foot leased for 71% of this office building which isn't going to deliver until the fourth quarter of 2016. We're having extensive conversations with retailers for the 65,000 square feet of space at 888 and are negotiating our first major lease there and we have completed leasings on the entire flagship expansion, that 33,000 square feet two-story that we added on top of legal and Sephora were and Eatay begins their work soon and we expect them to open in the third quarter of 2016. Big exciting things are about to happen at the Prudential Center.","At 100 Federal Street, we're in active discussions with two tenants to restack and relocate within the building in order to accommodate a major lease with a new tenant coming in. These transactions involve more than 1 million square feet of leasing on a long term basis in the building and take up all of the currently vacant space.","The sequencing of these moves and the delivery of the space will result in revenue recognition on the available space to be delayed until 2016 or early 2017. In fact, in order to complete the deal we actually had to take a floor back from a tenant this month which will add to the short-term availability at 100 Fed. At the risk of repeating myself, we're making decisions with a long term of view maximizing the value of the individual assets in the portfolio and we're sacrificing short-term FFO.","The Seaport has seen its first speculative construction so now Boston has a 400,000 square foot spec building being developed this quarter and there is purportedly another 370,000 square feet coming after that.","Moving out to the suburbs, the Waltham Metro West market continues to get stronger driven by expansion by shoe companies, life science and tech companies. While there are tenants that are relocating to urban locations, there continues to be significant organic growth in the Route 128 Lexington-Waltham market.","This quarter we did 15 leases in our suburban portfolio. We're now in lease negotiations for all of the remaining space at our development at 10 CityPoint and we expect to achieve rents in excess of $50 a square foot for this new project which will deliver in mid-2016. This is a 25% increase over the last 18 months.","While there is no speculative construction currently underway as Owen mentioned given the health of the market, we made the decision to take one of our vintage buildings, Reservoir Place North which was built in 1981, out of service and we're completing a complete gut rehab, new skin, new core locations and it will allow for tenant occupancy at the end of 2016. ","Again instead of doing a short-term deal at a lower rent, we decided to push the building, increase the rents to where we believe we will be in the mid-40s which will be significant upgrade over the then expiring rent which occurred this May in the low 30s. During the majority of our conversations at the June NAREIT meetings, there was a focus on demand in San Francisco and whether we were seeing signs of concern. Our answer was and continues to be no, we're not. The leasing activity continues to be healthy.","During the first half of 2015, Uber, FitBit, DocuSign, Lending Club, Stripe, all took blocks in excess of 100,000 square feet and last night there was a report in the paper that Apple, Apple the computer company from the Valley, completed their first lease South of Market in the city. Where there has been sublet space, it has been in small pockets and it has leased for strong rents. In fact we're getting sublet profit on two sublets at 680 Folsom.","Down in the Valley, Apple, Palo Alto Networks, LinkedIn, Aruba, Nutanix, Broadcom, have all looking for and committed to large new expansions. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 112,000 square feet of office leasing during the quarter. The largest deal was 75,000 square feet, the mark to market was over 50% on a gross basis and over 70% on a net basis. None of these transactions are in the same-store statistics for the quarter.","We're actively engaged with additional full floor tenants with 16 and 17 expirations in total. We have about 1 million square feet of lease expirations with an average rent of $53 a square foot at Embarcadero Center in 2016 and 2017. There are significant opportunities for rental increases in all these transactions and we continue to complete more transactions with an $80 starting rent.","Down in Mountainview, the lack of available supply has led to large jumps in market rents. A year ago we were making proposals of about $40 triple net on our single-story R&D. Today proposals are going out over $48 a square foot for this product. And in North San Jose at Zanker Road -- knock on wood -- we have a number of active building prospects including a user that is interested in all of the existing assets as well as the potential to expand the project by up to 500,000 square feet.","The one hole the portfolio if you will is at Gateway where we expect Genentech to vacate between 185,000 square feet and 285,000 square feet in early 2016. The good news here is that the CalTrain system is in the process of dramatically upgrading their South San Francisco station which is the first stop out of the city and a short walk to the property. So we're encouraged about the location more so today than we have been in the past.","At 535 Mission, we have completed additional leasing bringing our lease space to over 249,000 square feet and we have another lease out that gets us to 258,000 or 84% leased. That is nine months after we open the building. Our asking rents are in the low 80s.","And Salesforce Tower, our marketing team continues to actively market the building as we get closer to those lease expiration driven opportunities that we have been discussing previously. There is a continuous flow of users that have expressed an interest in the building and over the last quarter, we have had an additional 12 showings similar to the quarter before with users in excess of 50,000 square feet and we now have active proposals outstanding with two users for between three and four floors that are in negotiation.","With that I will stop and I will turn it over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Great, thanks, Doug. Before I get into our earnings and our projections, I just want to spend a minute on our balance sheet. We continue to have strong liquidity. We have $1.3 billion of cash. Owen covered that our development pipeline has grown, it has grown to $2.4 billion with about $1.3 billion remaining to fund so we continue to have all of the capital raised to fund our current pipeline.","Additionally over the last couple of years, we have utilized a portion of the cash raised from our asset sales to pay down debt. We're currently operating at a net debt to EBITDA that is now in the mid-5s. This is significantly below our more typical run rate in the 6.5 to 7 range and provides us with enhanced flexibility to fund additional investments with debt. The combination of debt repayment and the delivery of higher-yielding developments funded partially with asset sales has resulted in lower balance sheet leverage and that is despite paying out nearly $1.2 billion in special dividends in the past two years.","We've also been focused on our future debt maturities and we have engaged in an interest-rate hedging program to lock in the current interest rate environment. So far we have hedged $550 million of forward starting 10 year swaps targeting the refinancing of our $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue which is prepayable at par in September of 2016 and our $1.6 billion mortgage on the GM building that can be prepaid at par in June of 2017.","We have an additional $1.2 billion of mortgages expiring that we currently forecast refinancing in late 2016 and early 2017. We continue to monitor opportunities to accelerate this financing which could occur earlier in 2016 or even in late 2015 and could result in a one-time charge for a prepayment premium.","The bond market has endured some rate and spread volatility in the past 30 to 60 days from global events, but debt issuances continue to go well, be well received, in both the public and the private markets. And we believe our borrowing costs today for 10 years is attractive and below 4%.","So turning to our earnings for the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.36 per share. That was $0.03 per share or $4 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the earnings beat came from lower than expected operating expenses in the portfolio, primarily due to utilities and repair and maintenance expense.","We do expect approximately $2 million of the repair and maintenance items to occur in the second half of the year. So in reality, the second quarter benefit to our full year guidance from expense savings is only a penny. We reported termination income of $5.4 million which after accounting for non-controlling interest was about $1 million above our budget.","The largest piece of this was $3.8 million related to the acceleration of fair value rental income for FAO Schwartz. Since this lease was below market when we acquired the building, we have been amortizing into our income non-cash fair value rental income that we accelerated upon termination of the lease. As Doug mentioned, we will have a temporary tenant in place at FAO for a little over a year before we can capture the upside of leasing this space at market.","After adjusting for pushing a portion of our second quarter expense savings into the rest of 2015, the benefit from the second quarter results is less than $0.02 per share to our full year projections. As Owen mentioned, we have our 505 9th Street property under contract for sale. We anticipate a closing in September and the future lost income is approximately a penny per share to 2015.","Our portfolio occupancy improved 80 basis points this quarter to 91.1%, with the occupancy of Blue Cross Blue Shield in 300,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue in Boston, increases at Bay Colony and Waltham at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco and the continued lease up 250 W. 55th Street in New York City. We expect our occupancy to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year.","As we have described throughout the year, our same property portfolio performance in 2015 has been impacted by the increasing vacancy in Boston at the Hancock Tower. As Doug also mentioned, we have made a number of operating decisions that will limit our revenue and occupancy in 2016 but that we believe will enhance our long term performance.","This quarter we terminated our lease with FAO. It had a modest impact on our GAAP results for 2015 but it will lower our cash income for the rest of the year. And we terminated a lease at 100 Federal Street which also had an impact.","On the positive side, we continue to be active at Embarcadero Center signing early lease renewals and locking in rental rate increases. This quarter we signed 77,000 square feet of renewals for tenants that expire in 2016 where we will start straight lining the rental increases this year.","As a result of these facts, we now project 2015 same property NOI to be negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% from 2014. That is no change from last quarter. However cash same property NOI is projected to be negative 0.5% to positive 0.25% from 2014 which is a reduction from last quarter.","The projected NOI from our development properties is consistent with our guidance last quarter. The properties that are not on the same property portfolio include The Avant, 250 W. 55th Street, 680 Folsom St., 535 Mission St., 99 3rd Avenue, and 601 Mass Avenue and are projected to add an incremental $54 million to $60 million to our 2015 NOI.","Our non-cash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $84 million to $92 million for the full year 2015. That includes only our share of our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. There is approximately $50 million of free rent in these numbers that will burn off during 2015 and 2016, much of which is in our recently completed developments.","Our 2015 hotel NOI is projected to be in line with last quarter's guidance of $12 million to $14 million. Our development and management services income is tracking as expected. It is projected to be $18 million to $22 million in 2015. We project our net interest expense to be $422 million to $431 million for the year. Our development spend is meeting our current projections resulting in capitalized interest for 2015 of $31 million to $38 million.","Our forecast for non-controlling interest in property partnerships is unchanged from last quarter and for the full year we project a deduction to FFO of $135 million to $145 million.","So our guidance for 2015 funds from operations is now $5.37 to $5.45 per share, that is an increase of $0.01 per share at the midpoint compared to our guidance last quarter. If you exclude the impact of the expected sale at 505 9th Street, we would have been raising our guidance by $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio operations and higher termination income. In the third quarter 2015, we project funds from operations of $1.34 to $1.36 per share.","Owen mentioned the potential for additional asset sales in 2015 and other than the pending sale at 505 9th Street, we have not included any additional asset sales in our updated guidance. Although we will not provide formal guidance for 2016 until next quarter, I do want to touch on a couple of items that Doug mentioned which will impact our 2016 results.","These include the downtime associated with Citibank vacating 140,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, the rent differential and downtime from FAO vacating the GM building for a temporary user during part of 2016, the lease transition at 100 Federal Street, the loss of 200,000 square feet of occupancy in our Washington DC joint venture properties, and the leases expiring at our Gateway project in South San Francisco.","Our share of the projected aggregate reduced income from these transactions in 2016 is projected to be approximately $35 million which clips our same-store NOI by about 2% from 2015. Doug also mentioned the contractual sale of our 7 Cambridge Center lab building to its user in early 2016 which will result in the loss of an additional $13.3 million of NOI.","These items will impact our 2016 FFO though the effect on our AFFO will be far less significant due to the conversion of free rent to cash rents in the portfolio.","We do have positive catalysts to offset these losses including growth from the completion of the lease up of 250 W. 55th Street and 535 Mission as well as the delivery of an additional $850 million of new development between now and the end of 2016. We won't see the full impact of these deliveries in 2016 as several won't deliver until late in the year and they will be in lease up. This pipeline of near-term deliveries has a projected weighted average cash return of between 7.75% and 8% and is projected to stabilize by the end of 2017 generating approximately $70 million of GAAP NOI At stabilization.","In addition, we expect our organic growth to pick up late in 2016 and into 2017 with the lease up of our vacant space at the Hancock Tower and 100 Federal Street in Boston, the releasing of the FAO space and the rollup on expiring leases at Embarcadero Center. As I mentioned, we're not prepared to provide our 2016 guidance until next quarter but as you begin thinking about your FFO and AFFO models, we thought this would be helpful.","That completes our formal remarks today. I would appreciate it if the operator would open up the lines for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","I just wanted to quickly just talk about leasing CapEx for a second. It looked like it just a little higher in the quarter. I was just wondering if that was an issue of timing or what is really driving that?","Doug Linde","Most of the leasing CapEx is really driven by the makeup of the portfolio so to the extent that we have more urban longer-term leases generally it goes up. But we have typically averaged somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 plus or minus per square foot on a consistent basis on an average basis for the portfolio and there is nothing that occurred this quarter that was significant.","Mike LaBelle","I think if you look at the lease terms they were a little longer so our weighted average cost per lease term was like $5.39 I think which is in line with what our range typically is. And I think the renewals were a little bit lower than typical. Again it is just a makeup of whatever is happening that quarter so since we had more new leases versus renewal leases the costs were a little bit higher.","Tom Lesnick","And then just switching gears to the build-to-suit opportunities in DC, it looks like one of the projects I think it is a 550,000 square foot project that was in final-round bidding, something was expected to be announced here in the next month or two. Just wondering if there is any progress there at 1006 Sixth Street or if you can comment on that at all?","Owen Thomas","So those are two different projects. The one that you were describing I believe was the requirement for the GSA to do the TSA. So Ray, you can comment on that and then the second one is whether we have a tenant for 1001 which is the building in the CBD.","Ray Ritchey","So the TSA unfortunately has been caught up in the morass of GSA and while we expected it to take place in the second quarter, we're still awaiting the final award. It is a very competitive process but we have put forth a great offer and a terrific building in Springfield and we're cautiously optimistic that when they finally make an award that we will be under heavy consideration by the GSA.","As it relates to 1001 Sixth, we're also in a very competitive process there with a major corporation in DC. We're still in discussions with that group. We know that it has been narrowed down to two or three finalists. We believe we're one of those two or three. We have designed a great building, offered them a very competitive economic package and again we're cautiously optimistic about hearing something positive there as well.","Owen Thomas","Both of these projects are effectively 100% leased so there is no speculative risk associated with any available space.","Tom Lesnick","And then is there any update on the potential corporate relocation to the Wiehle Avenue site?","Owen Thomas","Well, we're in discussions with another corporation that we're under confidentiality with that is considering a site near the Wiehle Metro. Again that should be forthcoming by the next call if not sooner. It would involve us building a building there on their behalf and would involve both a land sale and a fee structure. But again we're not able to announce neither the terms nor the tenant at this point in time.","Tom Lesnick","And then now that The Avant is going through really its first season of lease roles, just wondering operationally what the renewal rate is and how you guys are faring on renewal spreads?","Doug Linde","The turnover rate is -- Peter, correct me if I'm wrong -- I think 30% and I believe we're achieving a premium over the competition of between 10% and 14% and that includes the stuff in Tyson so it has been spectacular.","Peter Johnston","Those are both correct.","Operator","The next call is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Maybe if we just look at sort of the repositionings, redevelopments that you guys spoke about. How much capital do you need to commit to those projects to get them sort of to where you want them to be in 2017 and onwards?","Doug Linde","So the capital has already been committed and it has been spent at the Hancock Tower other than obviously the rollover leasing that we will do. The project at 601 really has not been a fully vetted yet but it is probably somewhere in and around $100 million. We will also be doing a repositioning at 399 at some point in 2016 and 2017. It will be a repositioning light. John would probably describe it as an image change as opposed to a repositioning.","And then the project Mike described at Tracer Lane -- or sorry, at Reservoir North is about $25 million, as Owen put out there. And the work that is going to go on at the General Motors building at the retail I think in large part will be based upon the existing tenants and most of that capital will come from the users as opposed to from us.","Manny Korchman","And if we stick to the projects that you outlined, a dipping or dragging 2016, how much of a recovery of sort of lost revenues or lost NOI do you expect in 2017 from that same pool?","Doug Linde","If you are asking if there is a markdown or not I think there is a dramatic markup in every case. So we will get more than 100% of what we're losing in those rents. I think the only piece of space in the portfolio that is rolling over in 2016 and 2017 where we're a little bit tight on the mark to market is the low rise at 399 where right now on a cash basis, we're getting about $90 a square foot from Citi.","It is actually lower than that on a GAAP basis because of a straight line rent and it is the last five years of the lease but John, you can comment on this. I think that we hope to get high 80s to low 90s on that space and higher on an average basis.","John Powers","I think that will work out. We already have a couple of very good leads on that space and we're working very well in conjunction with Citi. They may be able to exit part of that early and we're in discussions with a specific tenant now for a portion of that. We do have a challenge, Doug mentioned the below grade space. It is 100,000 feet there and we will be working on that.","Manny Korchman","Maybe my last one for Owen, when you think about your acquisition pipeline or opportunities, how do you think about what you would do on balance sheet versus with a partner?","Owen Thomas","I think acquisitions today of existing leased buildings -- pricing is aggressive. That is why over the last couple of years we have been pretty active sellers of property. The building in Washington that we just announced at a little bit over $1000 a square foot is the best example. ","So the way we're thinking today about acquisitions of again new existing leased buildings is in partnership with Capital Sources, some from the U.S., some from outside the U.S. where we would make a significant coinvestment but we would enhance our return through compensation that we earn from applying our real estate skills whether it be managing the building, leasing the building, providing capital improvements or whatever is required.","Operator","Your next question call is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Can you talk a little bit more about the leasing demand for some of the space you are planning to backfill in 2016, 2017? Specifically the bigger blocks in New York and Boston?","Owen Thomas","I will let Bryan talk about Boston and then John can talk about New York.","Bryan Koop","One of the things that Doug mentioned earlier was the condition of our supply side in Boston. And one note that we're watching is our competitive set, those buildings that we really compete against on a day-to-day basis in each market is below 6%. And in Cambridge as an example, it is actually sub 2%. So we have got really, really limited supply in terms of who we're competing with on a day-to-day basis versus the whole greater market. But we have actually seen a 3% drop in the CBD market as well in terms of vacancy.","So the absorption has been really quite good. We have got good job growth in all sectors. I think the surprising zone to us has been the financial industry that Doug mentioned. We didn't anticipate seeing call it stabilization and job growth especially with the smaller firms on the BC side.","So we're seeing it in I think every category. It is not just the tech sector anymore or the biotech sector that we had earlier call it in the recovery of the market. The other side that has been quite surprising is the demand side in the Waltham market. Doug mentioned that we have done two deals with shoe companies. There is companies out there that are growing rapidly and it is all based on original shoe industry and the brands that are growing out there and it is really being perceived as a wonderful place to grow a company right now.","Doug Linde","Just to give you some specifics, Jamie, so the big quote unquote holes in our portfolio from an occupancy perspective right now our 100 Fed and at the Hancock Tower and I think I described that we have got literally more demand than we can actually find space for. So we're actually taking space back from tenants and restacking 100 Fed to deal with the 180,000 square feet of availability there.","We're in active discussions with tenants on the low rise portion of the Hancock Tower and again based upon what I said about Cambridge as well as the attractive nature of that space, we feel really good about the prospects for that and the pricing that we're asking. I will be brutally honest with you, we have known about the vacancy at the top of the building for the last couple of years and we have yet to lease any of those floors but it is a terrible showing.","On the other hand, we're asking for pretty big rents. I mean the rents that we're achieving at the top of the Hancock Tower are starting in the low 80s and higher. And so the pond that we're fishing in has relatively few fish and so we're being patient about that.","But we're very confident that they will come by and that we will be able to lease that space and that is why I'm saying that I believe we will do some leasing in 2015 we will do some leasing in 2016 but we may not have revenue produced on that space until sometime in late 2016 or early 2017. And those are really the blocks there. John, do want to comment on New York City?","John Powers","Yes, there is not a lot of space so I'll make my comments very brief. 250 is going very well and we have a lot of traffic at the top and we have some term sheets out now. So I think that that has been very well received in the market. We will get some space back from Wiehle. We already have interest in that space, we already have a very nice proposal on a big block part of one floor.","We talked about 399 before. Certainly the Towers space, the base, the X Morgan Lewis or existing Morgan Lewis space is not a concern at all in this market, we already have a deal on a big block of that.","Doug mentioned that we're doing some significant work at 399. We're tuning that up now with our marketing package. I think the building needs a little bit of loving care and money and we're going to do that and we have done that in a very careful calculated way. So our marketing on that building will really start with images and renderings, etc. in September.","But as I said before with regard to the low rise, we have already been in discussions with Citi potentially on getting back perhaps one of the floors or more a little earlier and to target that with some large tenants we're talking about.","Owen Thomas","If I could just mention one other thing, we will be adding something that is going to be pretty spectacular at 399 where the Citi auditorium is now on the top of the 13th floor. We're going to put a pavilion there and it will be a green space, it will have a green roof, it will be outdoor space, it will be pretty spectacular and we will connect that with the 14th floor when the lease expires there in 2017.","I think that will be a very big enhancement for someone that wants a conference center on that space, a reception on that space. And because of the elevated situation in the building, this may be too micro but Citi had a couple of private elevators. We would be able to connect those directly to the low rise floors so that is, we're very excited about that.","Bryan Koop","Some additional color on Boston, this is Bryan Koop, I cannot remember a period of time when we have had as much call it discussion and activity with our existing customers about growth. It is everything from small growth 5000, 10,000 square feet to even large chunks of space, 50,000 to 100,000 square feet. But our existing customer base is where I think we're going to see a good bit of our absorption.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. I guess just on New York in terms of the big block demand, I mean you guys sound pretty comfortable you will be able to lock in tenants for both 601 and 399 when that time comes?","John Powers","601, the only block that we will have at 601 will be in the low rise building, that is 145,000 feet. And we're working on a repositioning of that. If it works out the way we want it to, I think that will be a very unique offering in the market in terms of the location, in terms of the outside amenities and what we want to do there. But more on that later. The block at 399 I already spoke about, we already have some interest on.","Doug Linde","Just to reiterate what I said in my comments, Jamie, so we don't have places to put Citibank right now physically and we want to relocate them out of that low rise block so that we can reposition and redevelop it and so our guys are creatively looking to figure out ways to take some space back that is currently rent producing and move Citi into that space so that we can actually do this work which is again as I said, we're looking to create vacancy so we can put the capital in to reposition the building to ultimately dramatically enhance the concourse area, the atrium and this low rise space which has a dip in 2016 and 2017 but it is going to be fantastic for the asset as well as for that corner where we have 399, 599 and 601 in a couple of years.","Jamie Feldman","And I guess just back to the question on working with a partner to maybe expand the portfolio. We have got the EOP trade in the pipeline, would you be interested in going to a new market?","Owen Thomas","Jamie, we're always open and considering new markets. In the markets we would like to be in, I don't think the pricing issue is much different from what we have been describing about our core markets. Also I would point out I think our move into Brooklyn is somewhat of a new market for us albeit in New York City.","Operator","Your next call is from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Maybe Owen or Doug, so just on the Dock 72 development project there, I guess you guys have a substantial prelease there for one third of it but it is a development project, it doesn't deliver it looks like until maybe late 2017 or early 2018. And it is more of an emerging submarket as opposed to the typical BXP establish submarkets. Does this investment and development project suggest that you guys feel really good about the economic cycle over the next few years?","Owen Thomas","I think as I mentioned in my remarks and I have been mentioning over the quarters, we do feel the economic recovery though it has been modest, it has been steady. And we have been getting positive absorption of office space as a result and if you look at where tenant demand and where the real net absorption is, it has been for it the technology, life sciences and other creative tenants and there are districts in major cities throughout the world that are becoming increasingly acceptable to corporations particularly in the technology area.","And so we could go city by city and identify new areas that were atypical office locations and I would say Brooklyn is in that category and if you look at what is happening in Brooklyn today, the rent growth that exists, the transit avoidance that Brooklyn provides, we think it is going to reflect tremendous growth for us in the future.","So again, we're increasingly making investments if you look around the portfolio of buildings in our core markets or in related core markets that are designed to be attractive to the whole technology, media and life science industries.","Doug Linde","I think that is the gating issue which is as we have looked at the Manhattan market, we're very comfortable with our portfolio in midtown Manhattan and the tenant customer that we're pursuing for that portfolio and the growth that that customer is seeing. And we've talked about it ad nauseam before and our ability to lease even large floor plate spaces on Park Avenue that were once headquarters for the universal banks and there are other types of users for that.","But we have also recognized that there is a group of tenants that had migrated first to Midtown South and now they are migrating some to the West side, some downtown where many of those employees are coming from Brooklyn and where we're able to build a brand-new building that has all the attributes and the quote unquote cool nature from a physical perspective of what you can get in a building that you could find in Midtown South and others and do it at a much more affordable price than you can achieve today in the same types of buildings and closer to the demographic of where those people actually live and the commuting patterns.","And so it is not predicated on a dramatic improvement or continuation of a boom in the economic cycle as much as it is a recognition that this is the reality of how users want to be locating their requirements in the new world of user demand that Manhattan is now seeing.","Brendan Maiorana","And then just with respect to outlook on asset recycling, so I think your guidance for the year is $750 million of dispositions. I guess you've -- maybe $200 million is closed year to date, you have got the 5059s which is going to be more. How are you thinking about dispositions for the remainder of the year? Could that guidance number, could it actually come out much different than that number?","How should we think about maybe dispositions relative to acquisitions because my read of your comments about potential JVs or what have you maybe seems like you are a little bit more optimistic that you could close an acquisition versus prior commentary?","Owen Thomas","To answer your question on the dispositions as we have been saying, our target is 750 and we have done 377 so far this year measured as our share. I think we still feel that the target that we provided is roughly accurate. We have some additional targeted sales that we're considering. We hope to accomplish them and that will result in something around $750 million. I don't see a big break either way on that.","On acquisitions, it is very hard to target acquisitions and in fact we don't do that. What we do is we look at investments that we think are in terrific markets that are great properties and we selectively pursue them and if we're able to accomplish the acquisition on economics that make sense for us, we will move forward and if not we don't.","So we're out there, we're looking at things but I don't think you should interpret anything from our remarks that we're more likely or less likely to do any acquisitions before the end of the year.","Operator","Your next call is from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","So more specifically on Dock 72, can you comment on the terms and the discount if you would characterize it as such that someone like a WeWork requires to make a 20-year commitment to a fairly large block versus the $60 per square foot that I think you mentioned you hope to get when you lease the more conventional way?","John Powers","Well, WeWork brought a lot to the table to this collaborative effort and my now long experience dealing with ground-up development and major buildings, the anchor tenant always gets somewhat of an advantage deal and WeWork did in this case. But the other issue is WeWork took primarily the base of the building which will in most cases rent for less and we're comfortable with their terms and it has been folded into our pro forma.","Finally, let me say that they do have options and the options that they have will be at a different price than they paid for their initial take.","Vance Edelson","And when you say they are bringing a lot to the table and you are referring to them as a codeveloper, just to be clear, could you expand on their involvement? Presumably there is no financial commitment it is just planning and advice so of speak given their experience with collaborative space, is that a good way to think about it?","John Powers","We're going to have significant amenities space there. We're going to have a very interesting food offering [Technical Difficulty] we will have a basketball court, we will have a lawn for our different activities. We have conference space, we have a very, very large wellness center and they are curating all of that on our behalf under an arrangement. So we think that that is going to add something. They are very good at doing this.","And we think that also their input and impact to the development is going to be a positive in terms of other tech tenants and when they look at WeWork, many of them think they are like-minded and want the same things and I think they have been very, very successful doing a curation of different parts of their member base, dealing with parts of their member base.","Vance Edelson","And then just sticking with the Navy Yard in general, the transit avoidance that you mentioned notwithstanding, one of the concerns we hear is that the subway stops are not particularly close. So do you have any comments on future transportation or mass transit enhancements that might remedy the situation especially given the possibility of more development there over time? Or do you picture the employees living so close that that is how they are avoiding mass transit?","John Powers","Certainly there is a move to, as Doug said -- to Brooklyn as a choice to live for many of the TAMI workers. That is a clear trend that has been going on for quite some time. And if you drive around Brooklyn, you probably see as many or more cranes there than you do in Manhattan and most of that is residential.","So certainly that is a part of it but clearly a big part of that is going to be dealing with what I call the last mile issue. So just to put this in context, 70,000 people worked in the Navy Yard during World War II. They all got to work, they all went home and most of them used subways. The Navy Yard is within one mile of about six different subway lines.","So the question that -- the challenge we really have is to solve this last mile issue because where those people walk the last mile, our creative workers probably don't have the time or want to allocate the time to do that although a lot of them will bike and I think biking is part of the answer here. But we will run two shuttle services. They will be reliable, efficient and very tech friendly.","We will put these together in collaboration with WeWork and the Navy Yard and we will run those two locations, one on the G train by Washington Ave stop and one between the A train and the F Train. And these trains for example, you get to the A train, the first stop is the Folsom Street in New York plus these trains go out into Brooklyn to a lot of places where these people want to live. So we think we have a last mile problem. We know it, we have studied it and we're going to have a very good solution that we think is going to work very well.","Vance Edelson","And then just one last question shifting gears, down in DC it sounds like a lot of your decisions these days are driven by your long term prospectives. So could you comment on how the CBD's strength or lack thereof may have played into your decision to sell 505 Ninth or would you characterize that decision as one that is more long term in nature and would have been the same even if DC had made a major step in the right direction in the past year?","Ray Ritchey","I will take a crack at that. It is Ray Ritchey. The specific on 505 Ninth Street was really a concern and a respect for our partnership. We have a 50-50 partnership there with two families that have generational concerns. We looked at the point in time both in the cycle of the building and the cycle of the market and we felt it was best to advise our partnership to take it to the market and see what we could get. And we're going to net a value over 1000 square foot.","We're still strongly committed to the CBD, Washington DC. The successfully have at 601 Mass I think demonstrates the depth and breadth that the market is still there. Our ability to retain tenants in our existing buildings and attract new ones while we do have vacancy, we're still all-in in the CBD in Washington DC.","Owen Thomas","I can also add to that as we said in the past on dispositions, I think more or less fall into a couple of different categories. One, assets that we would consider non-core going forward and others where we frankly got we think a very attractive price relative to the economics in the property. And this deal given the pricing that I described we felt it was an attractive opportunity for us to raise some money.","Doug Linde","And to be fair to your question, we have sold a lot of assets in DC. But I think the gating issue for us has been when you sign a 20 year lease in DC with 2.5% or 3% increases, you have effectively created a long term bond and this is exactly what the sovereign wealth fund and domestic pension fund advisors are dying to own.","And there is not a lot of churn in these assets that we can do on a going forward basis until those leases expire. And interestingly while we have had the success of moving tenants within our portfolio in some of our other markets or within buildings, in DC interestingly enough because of the long term nature of these leases, we haven't really done a lot of that.","So when we look at our portfolio and look at our portfolio as to what is most salable, it hits the needle on the head and it is the kind of assets that are exactly what are most desired in today's capital markets.","Operator","Your next call is from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Maybe just talk about San Francisco a little bit. It sounds like you have some good activity at Salesforce Tower but 181 Fremont is still last I heard vacant and then Park Tower looks like it is going forward. I know the completion dates are a little bit different for the three assets. But can you talk a little bit about how that is affecting tenant conversations and potentially rent growth in that couple of block radius?","Bob Pester","First off, 181 Fremont, it is all lower floors that they have available and they are much smaller floor plates, they are 14,000 square foot range. So although it is competition we don't see it as great competition for the floors that we have available at Salesforce Tower. Block five, not going to deliver until probably 2019. It has all the trailers and construction activity for the Transbay Terminal right now. I know they keep saying that they are going to deliver in 2018. I just don't see how that is going to happen.","Again, that is a smaller floor plate building and it gets smaller as the building rises. It is a nice building with outdoor decks but it is probably going to lag us by a year and a half to two years. Although it is competition I don't see it as major competition for us as well.","I know Doug mentioned on Salesforce Tower that we have got good activity. We're actually exchanging paper with several tenants right now and the tour activity is as good as I have ever seen on a building under construction.","Craig Mailman","And then, Mike, I know you had mentioned maybe doing some debt repayments earlier depending on what the prepayment is. Could you just walk through kind of what pieces of debt are potentially kind of 2015 repayments and kind of what you're NPV analysis or cutoffs would be to do that in 2015 versus wait until 2016?","Mike LaBelle","So we've basically got three pieces of debt coming due, the smallest one is Fountain Square which is a building that we own in a consolidated joint venture right now and we expect to be buying it out sometime either late this year or early next year. And that loan can be prepaid in I think it is April and we would just pay that off, that is about $200 million.","And then there are two bigger ones which is Embarcadero Center and the Hancock Tower loan and those total about $1 billion. I would say those are the two loans we're thinking about with regard to maybe doing something early and that is why we haven't been targeting our hedging toward those two financings.","What we really kind of think about is okay, how much is the prepayment penalty and if we bundle that into our costs, what does the breakeven rate have to be when we can pay these loans off and how do we feel about that breakeven rate versus our view of rates? It is somewhere between 75 and 80 basis points, something like that today.","One could say that is attractive. However, the prepayment penalty does come down significantly every month that we wait. So we're tracking this on a monthly basis depending on what the yield curve does. If you look at the yield curve and what it says it is going to do today, that breakeven rate drops below 50 basis points in early 2016.","So that would be maybe a more attractive time, we will see what happens. The yield curve doesn't ever seem to be completely right as we all know but that is the kind of analysis we're thinking about so we don't have a specific point in time in mind but we're monitoring it and if we see an attractive window I think that we will go forward with it.","Operator","Your next call is from Gabriel Hilmoe with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Gabriel Hilmoe","I guess, Mike, I realize you are not giving official guidance for next year yet but obviously a lot of ins and outs going into 2016 which it sounds like next year may be somewhat of a mirror to 2015 at least from a same-store growth perspective. But can you just walk through the pieces that will be coming into the same-store pool next year that I guess will at least be additive from development that isn't directly impacting same-store results this year? And I guess if you can quantify just what the expected cash impact is that maybe is offsetting -- I think you mentioned the 2% hit from 601 Lexington, 100 Federal, FAO and some of the other drags?","Mike LaBelle","The three buildings that will be coming into the same-store that aren't in the same-store this year are 250 W. 55th Street, 535 Mission and The Avant. So, those three haven't been in our quoted same-store numbers that I give to you.","The Avant is leased up through 2015, it is fully leased now so it has been fully leased for the past couple of quarters. So it will have an increase but not a significant one. 250 as Doug mentioned I think in our supplemental, it is 70% leased. As Doug mentioned, it is 89% leased with leases that haven't commenced it and we've got good activity on the rest of the space at the rents that Doug and John had mentioned.","So I think that is going to be a big mover for us next year from both a GAAP and a cash basis because probably through half of this year some of the tenants were in pre-rent. I mean Case-Shiller was in pre-rent through the first half of this year. You actually saw our straight line go down from the first quarter to the second quarter. They were the reason and there are some other tenants that are in pre-rent in 2015 that won't be in 2016.","And then at 535 Mission, kind of obviously smaller building but kind of similar story with some terms of the lease up with that. Again I don't want to give you specific numbers right now but those are the kind of bigger drivers from the development pipeline that are going to help.","Gabriel Hilmoe","Okay, I think you mentioned what the expectation of at least what the FFO impact was going to be. Could you just maybe repeat that?","Mike LaBelle","I mentioned that there is $35 million of transactions that Doug mentioned where we're going to lose occupancy that will be a negative. On the development pipeline, I indicated that we would be stabilizing $850 million of developments between 2016 and 2017 that by the end of 2017 when those are all stabilized, they are going to add approximately $70 million of GAAP NOI and have a cash return of between 7.75% and 8%. But again that is stabilizing through 2016 and 2017.","So it will start to influence and a building like 601 Mass Avenue is a building that will help us in 2016 but it is not going to be in the same-store in 2016. None of those developments the $850 million will be in the same store in 2016 but the income that is starting to come from those things will start in 2016 and help us.","Operator","Your next call is from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","I appreciate the comment that you are able to fund with cash everything that you currently have in the development pipeline. I was just hoping to get an update on what you are thinking about in terms of the possibility of paying a special based on the sales activity that you have had this year? And if you were to pay a special, how we should think about sources of capital to fund the current development pipeline and then in anything else that you might add to it?","Mike LaBelle","I can tell you that the gain associated with the assets that we have sold already as well as the projected gain for 505 W. Ninth assuming it sells, is approximately $200 million. From a taxable income perspective, we have sized our regular dividend to be generally in line with our taxable income.","So I would expect that that $200 million or somewhere thereabouts would be excess. We have set these up as 1031s to try to retain that cash but we have talked about the acquisition environment and the low likelihood of us being able to put those into exchanges. And with 505 Ninth Street is a joint venture so you really have to acquire in the same joint venture so I would say that is pretty unlikely that we would be successful in doing that.","Doug Linde","Just to sort of answer the second part of your question, there are absolutely no capital raising liquidity issues that we have regardless of what the special dividend might be based upon gains on sale so that is not a factor in the way we're thinking about this. As Mike described, we're running at the lowest EBITDA ratio I think we have ever run as a public company. And I think it is a little premature to talk about our dividend policy without having had a conversation with our Board which we generally have toward the end of the third quarter because it is not appropriate to get out ahead of that.","Brad Burke","Okay, but just reading into that, we should think about incremental sources of capital being balance sheet cash and debt versus significant additional asset sales as we think about 2016. Is that a fair way to summarize it?","Mike LaBelle","Owen said $750 million was 2015. I don't think we have described what if any asset sale plans we have for 2016. And we're not, I don't think at this point we're prepared to talk about that, but we do not -- I want to emphasize this -- have a capital liquidity issue. We're sitting on more cash than we have ever sat on and we continue to find opportunities to increase our cash flow from the portfolio.","And many of the new projects that we're entering into like the Brooklyn Navy Yard are with partners where we will provide third-party construction financing for a significant portion of the capital structure. So again, the amount of equity, quote\/unquote or our share of the capital is not significant relevant to what it might have been had we done things on our own and we were doing everything on our balance sheet.","Brad Burke","And then just a quick one on GAAP same-store guidance for 2015, you have been trending above the full year guidance for the first half of the year. And I think I heard you indicate that occupancy would be relatively flat with current levels for the balance of the year.","So you gave us a lot of things to think about over the next couple of quarters, but I was hoping that you could highlight a couple of the bigger ones that might be driving the expected deceleration.","Mike LaBelle","We talked about the GM Building with FAO Schwarz. I mentioned from a GAAP perspective, that didn't have a material impact to the full year. But we recognized a lot of termination income from that deal this quarter. So for the last two quarters, that building will have a lower contribution. I think that from an occupancy perspective, I said that we would be approximately where we're.","Last quarter, I think I said we would be slightly below 91%. Our occupancy projections are really in the same place that they were. So they are going to be somewhere around 91%. It could be slightly below, it could be a touch higher, but I consider that generally stable with what it is now -- below 91%, I'm sorry. So that is really kind of the drivers.","Operator","Your next call is from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","I know you are not giving 2016 guidance yet but broadly speaking just given all of the moving parts you have outlined, is it fair to think about 2016 as sort of a transition year with flattish type of occupancy and cash same-store NOI growth just sort of akin to this year?","Doug Linde","I would characterize 2016 as a year where we have made some explicit decisions to take some chips off the table in order to reposition assets for the long term that will be significantly accretive to our NAV and our earnings on a going forward basis. And so those things have significant impacts. So not sure that is a transition, those are explicit decisions. Transition is you have a lot of roll over and you have to sort of run through the rollover.","We have that every year. We may have a little bit more in 2017 actually than we have in 2016 because of what is going on at 399 and that is a pretty big chunk of space. But I would characterize 2016 as we're making some very explicit investment decisions and we have chosen to take some chips off of the table from an occupancy perspective in order to reposition and improve the long term cash flow characteristics and value of some of our assets.","Jed Reagan","And just wondering if you have seen any evidence at all of upward pressure on cap rates in your core markets just given some of the recent changes in treasury yields and borrowing costs? And I guess related to that, Mike, you mentioned the sub 4% execution you would get on 10 year bonds, today just wondering if that would be closer to 3% or 4% at this point?","Mike LaBelle","On the question with respect to the weight capital or interest by investors we have not seen any diminution in that at all. And I would also point out that a lot of the investors that we see in the marketplace are not using significant leverage so I don't think interest rates have as big an impact at least for Class A office properties in our core market.","Doug Linde","I think somebody mentioned some Blackstone selling. You are likely going to hear about or see a print on the assets that Blackstone is currently selling in Boston and I don't think we're surprised at where those assets are going to trade. And they are going to I think look at again you are going to look at our portfolio and you were going to go wow.","We purchased a building in 2011 at the Hancock Tower now called 200 Clarendon Street for $435 a square foot and it is the superior asset in the city and you are going to see I expect a print that is more than double that if not significantly more than that over the next month or so with those other assets.","And it is a demonstration that there is a continued desirability for these core iconic assets in our markets. And interestingly in some of these markets, they are starting to become somewhat of a scarcity issue as well because there are relatively few assets that will likely be sold over the next number of years.","And the new buyers that have come in are I think what one would characterize as not transitional buyers but long term buyers who expect to own these assets not necessarily forever but certainly for an extended period of time with a very long term horizon in terms of how they are going to invest in the assets.","Jed Reagan","And then just, Mike, on the unsecured debt question?","Mike LaBelle","So the unsecured debt market right now, our credit spreads are somewhere in the 150s I would say for 10 years. So we're talking about a borrowing rate today of somewhere 380 to 390 probably and if you were talking about the secured debt market, I think that for high quality assets that have pretty low leverage, 50% to 60% leverage, you are talking 160 basis points, 170 basis points maybe a little bit tighter than that. And then as the leverage goes up, it could be north of 200 basis points but generally borrowing costs again are in and around 4%.","The other thing I want to mention on your same store question is when you look at the quarterly same stores -- I'm quoting an annual same-store so in the supplemental we quoted quarterly to quarterly so a property like The Avant might be in the quarterly to quarterly but it would not be in the annual to the annual. So there is a little bit of a difference in the same-store profile when you think about that.","Jed Reagan","And just last one on the upcoming GSA expirations you guys talked about in DC, do you think they will be making long term decisions on those spaces or do you think it could be more of sort of a kicking the can down the road and short-term holdovers over the next couple of years?","Peter Johnston","On the bulk of it, it is likely going to be kicking the can for the reasons Doug described. There are going to be certain procurements similar to the one we're chasing down in Springfield where because it is a consolidation and they may be able to align the need for new space along with the fact that the existing facility doesn't meet the necessary security requirements that they are actually going to go and make the jump because they have been able to argue to Congress that they need the money for the consolidation. But I think the bulk of it will likely be kicking the can for as I said the reasons Doug described.","Operator","Your next call is from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Doug, you said something very interesting when you were talking about the General Motors retail space where you just offhandedly said that that cost would be covered by the retail tenants which sort of begs the question on office tenants. It seems to us that tenant improvements have been stubbornly high despite improving markets.","Is there any chance that tenant improvement costs or releasing costs come down as these markets continue to improve? Or is that cost sort of embedded in the business and the landlord is effectively a financier of the tenants?","Doug Linde","I will give you a general comment, John and if any of our regional folks want to chime in, please feel free. I would say that the marginal change in tenant improvement dollars has been de minimis through good and bad cycles other than with renewal tenants in the hyper hot markets where we basically say if you want to renew we're not giving you any money.","I think the actual cost of doing improvements has gone up exponentially over the past four or five years and so what once would cover a tenant's build out at $65 or $70 a square foot is probably covering maybe 50% of it in our CBD locations. And so I think that it is a factual part of the business that we're all in. But we certainly don't see it other than in Washington DC where the market has been weaker; we really haven't seen much of an increase in it over the past four or five years either.","Operator","Your next call is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","If we just think about your multifamily comments you made in the pipeline going forward, what kind of dollars are we thinking about in the multifamily projects?","Owen Thomas","There were two that I mentioned that were in the pre-development pipeline and I don't think we want to get into a tremendous amount of specifics over their costs and we're still working out all the details of it. But I would say approximately actually a little bit depends on, it depends on some decisions that we make about some of the projects that we have. If I had to give you a range I would probably say $300 million to $600 million.","Manny Korchman","And would those be long term holds within the portfolio or something more like the Avenue where you would hold it until you sort of found a good spot in the cycle to sell?","Owen Thomas","We're not building the residential to sell it when it is complete because it is residential. There were some case facts around The Avenue that led us to conclude that was a good asset to sell but they are not immediately targeted for sale when they are complete.","Manny Korchman","And my final question, given the partnership you discussed with WeWork in Brooklyn, any considerations or any discussions with WeLive on the residential side of things?","Owen Thomas","No.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Owen Thomas","Well, just to summarize, we were slightly above consensus for the quarter. We increased our guidance slightly for 2015 and hopefully we provided you helpful details on investments that we're electing to make to enhance our portfolio that have some impact on 2016 results. With that, thank you for all of your attention.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call.

Sara joined us last week as Vice President and Head of Investor Relations and comes with a wealth of experience in the field. We are delighted that you are here.","Good morning, everyone. Second quarter marked another strong period of wins in leasing and new investments, and we continue to complete major steps towards achieving our growth goals. In this last quarter, we generated FFO per share which is $0.04 above our guidance, $0.02 above street consensus and increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 FFO guidance by $0.07. We leased 1.7 million square feet, which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period. This brings us to almost 4 million square feet leased in the first half of the year, and we achieved several important leasing wins on key in-service assets, which Doug will review. And just this past July, we secured Verizon as anchor tenant to develop a 627,000 square-foot office tower in Boston as the last phase of our Hub on Causeway project with Delaware North. We closed the acquisition of Santa Monica Business Park in West LA with CPPIB as a capital partner, and we closed a joint venture with the Moinian Group for the future development of 3 Hudson Boulevard, a large-scale office property in the Hudson Yards.","So, overall, Q2 was a strong quarter for Boston Properties with activity in leasing, development and acquisitions continuing in July.","We continue to experience a positive environment for commercial real estate, including high-quality office assets in gateway cities which is our focus with several economic and market tailwinds.","First, overall economic conditions continue to be quite favorable and have if anything improved since last quarter. Though impacted by timing of new trade tariffs, second quarter U.S. GDP growth was 4.1% and is projected to be 2.8% for all of 2018. Job creation remains steady with 630,000 jobs created in the second quarter and the unemployment rate stable at 4%. Though the prospects of trade wars and political turmoil is unsettling and economic downturn does not seem imminent to us.","On capital markets, though the Fed increased rates 25 basis points in June and is signaling additional increases in 2018, the 10-year treasury rate actually as of morning is trading roughly flat to the level that it traded on our last earnings call. Obviously, the yield curve is flattening, given low inflation in global market forces. We don\u2019t see significant long-term interest rate increases as a major risk factor to our business at this time. Given this economic backdrop and the fact that the supply and demand of office space remain in general equilibrium, leasing activity is healthy across most of our geographic markets and with customers in numerous industries.","In the private real estate market, transaction volume growth has turned positive. Specifically, U.S. large asset transaction volume in the second quarter increased 9% from the first quarter and 15% over the second quarter of \u201817. Office represented 31% of the transaction volume for the quarter and increased 4% from the first quarter of 2018. Investor appetite and as a result cap rates remain healthy in our core markets. There were once again, numerous significant asset transactions this quarter with cap rates in the 4s and prices per square-foot above replacement cost.","Starting in Boston, Pier 4 in the Seaport is selling for a low 4s cap rate and just under $1,200 a foot to a domestic pension advisor. This building is 370,000 square feet and 93% leased. In New York, a 20% interest in 10 Hudson Yards sold to a domestic pension fund at a 4% cap rate and just over $1,200 a foot. The building is new, comprises 1,000,008 [ph] square feet and fully leased.","In San Francisco 345 Brannan in the SoMa district is under agreement to sell for a San Francisco record price of $1,326 a square-foot and a 5 cap rate to a REIT. Property is 110,000 feet and is ","100% leased to Dropbox. And finally, in Washington DC, 2099 Pennsylvania Avenue located across the street from our future development at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue is under agreement to sell for $1,054 a square-foot and a 4% cap rate to a domestic pension advisor. This building is a little over 2,000 feet and is 98% leased.","Moving to Boston Properties capital activities, we\u2019re having an active year selling non-core assets and will likely exceed our $300 million disposition target this year. We recently closed the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington, Mass for $22 million. With this sale, we\u2019ve completed nearly $150 million in dispositions year-to-date. We are marketing for sale of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue located near Dupont Circle in Washington DC. This 320,000 square-foot property will be fully vacated by Akin Gump in 2019. We are executing many new developments in DC and the lighter renovation of this asset justified by market conditions is not a good fit with our ongoing strategy.","We are considering recapitalization options for our 634,000 square-foot build-to-suit to for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia, in order to free-up capital for our growing development pipeline. If completed, we will refund our invested capital to date, avoid future development draws and generate development fees as well as a return on our invested capital. And we continue to explore additional sales of select non-core assets throughout the portfolio.","Moving to acquisitions. Last week, we announced the closing of our Santa Monica Business Park acquisition in LA. We did enter into a joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board who will own 45% of the project and the venture completed $300 million of acquisitions financing. Boston Properties resultant equity investment in the property is approximately $180 million. On returns, our initial unleveraged cash yield is nearly 4% and is expected to be over 6% in five years due to market roll-ups and must take space from Snap, a major tenant. Most of the property is encumbered by ground lease with an above market coupon and a market purchase option in 10 years. The coupon on the ground rent is above the stabilized cash yield of the asset. So, the future purchase of the land will be accretive to annual returns.","We are excited and honored to form this first partnership with CPPIB, which both of us hope and expect will lead to future joint investments. We\u2019re also very pleased with our increased presence in the Los Angeles market, which doubled with this deal and our critical mass in Santa Monica.","Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value. We remain very active, pursuing both new pre-lease projects and sites for future projects. Specifically, we announced last week, the Boston Properties has entered into a partnership with the Moinian Group to purchase a 25% stake in 3 Hudson Boulevard, one of the most attractive, large tenant sites in New York City. The site supports a 2 million square-foot office building and is located adjacent to the nearly completed 7 train entrance. Boston Properties will assume operational control of the co-development, and construction and the foundation for the tower is already underway.","We were able to acquire the site at an attractive price and minimize our capital outlay. We invested $46 million at closing and have a commitment to fund an additional $62 million in the future capital if capital is needed by the venture. We believe the purchase price for the land approximates $360 per FAR square-foot and significantly less on a rentable square-foot basis. When you factor in the initial FAR purchase, option prices for the remaining FAR and funding today on the foundations and below grade base building components. We also provided $80 million of financing to replace an existing land loan.","Our focus now is securing a significant anchor tenant, which is a precondition of commencing vertical construction. With the closing of -- with the 3 Hudson Boulevard joint venture and our previously described development at 343 Madison Avenue, we now have two major sites in New York for future growth. Continuing the theme of conserving our public equity capital, we are also working toward bringing in a capital partner for the project at 343 Madison Avenue, currently in the pre-development phase.","In Boston, we announced yesterday that we executed a lease agreement with Verizon Communications for approximately 440,000 square feet to anchor a 100 Causeway, a 627,000 square-foot 31-storey office tower. This is the last phase of the Hub on Causeway, our 1.4 million square-foot multi-phase development located adjacent to North Station and the TD Garden. The first two phases of the project are underway and include a hotel and residential tower on top of the mixed-use podium. We are developing the site as part of the 50-50 joint venture with Delaware North. A 100 Causeway is 70% preleased and we are in tenant discussions to lease the balance of the building.","Our future invested capital is estimated to be $260 million and projected initial cash yields are consistent with our development hurdles, approaching 7%. Also in Boston, we\u2019re in discussions with an existing tenant at Kendall Center to redevelop an office property for their expansion. And lastly, this quarter, in Reston, we delivered into service our 508-unit Signature residential project which is in the early phases of lease-up.","Our current development and redevelopment pipeline stands at 13 office and residential projects comprising 6 million square feet and $3.3 billion of investment for our share. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.1 billion remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 83% preleased and aggregate projected cash yields approximate 7%. These figures exclude the $1.4 billion in new developments we have described in this and previous calls where we have anchor lease commitments, but have not commenced the project including 2,100 Pennsylvania Avenue Reston Gateway and 100 Causeway. These projects will all commence in 2018 and 2019.","Our capital strategy remains unchanged. Our best use of capital today is launching new preleased development and making select value-add acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisitions, and the inferred cap rate and repurchasing our shares, notwithstanding their material discount to NAV. Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing, which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to select non-core assets, which raises marginal capital. The sale of larger core assets is a less efficient funding source, given significant embedded tax gains and resulting special dividend requirements. We can accomplish our growth plan without accessing public equity capital, given the debt capacity and delivered developments, and if needed, access the plentiful private equity capital.","This has been another significant quarter of wins for Boston Properties, both in the new investments I described and in leasing, which Doug is about to discuss. Our outlook and future growth plan continue to be strong and viable. We remain confident with our plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And continuing growth in 2020 and 2021 is now becoming more clear and likely, given all the new developments we\u2019ve added an expect to add to our pipeline.","Let me turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thank you, Owen. Good morning, everybody.","Last quarter, I began my comments by saying that we were as busy as we\u2019ve ever been. We are actually busier today. Owen\u2019s comments focused on a string of additional investments that we have moved from pursuit into the active pipeline. We\u2019ve been communicating these opportunities for a number of quarters. And in the case of 100 Causeway Street, which will be an immediate development start, once again, we found another anchor customer that matches with our fundamental strategy of creating great places where tenants can best attract and retain talent. You can\u2019t lose track of the labor availability, employment picture in our market. The unemployment rate for people with a degree from a college, BS or BA is about 2% across the board. Finding an engaged, high-quality workforce is a critical issue for our tenants, and we believe our new and rejuvenated portfolio is a huge advantage. This is our value proposition.","Last October, we had our investor conference in Boston and we described our development activities, the major capital refreshment that was underway, our vacancy and our leasing exposure in \u201818 and \u201819. The conclusion was that the portfolio was in a really good shape, with the exception of 159 East 53rd St. and 399 Park Avenue where we had a lot a row to hoe. Those two assets with the combined availability of over 700,000 square feet have the potential to contribute $55 million of annualized first year revenue. Remember, we only own 55% of 159 East 53rd. We explicitly stated that it was the most important operational challenge we had in front of us in \u201818. And I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.","We had 480,000 square feet of availability last October at 399 Park Avenue. If you picture our stacking plan moving from the top to the bottom, floors 39 and 38 have been leased 50,000 square feet; floors 26 and 25 have been leased 50,000 square feet. We are negotiating a lease for floors 18, 19, 20, 70,000 square feet. The 14th floor has been leased 40,000 square feet. And we recently signed an LOI and are negotiating a lease for 7, 8, 9 and 10, 250,000 square feet. If my math is correct, that totals 460,000 square feet of leases, 140,000 square feet which are signed. We have two tenants that are competing for the last first floor available, the 21st floor about 23,000 square feet. And just to top up this activity, this week, we expect to sign a 30-year lease commitment for the entirety of the office space at 159 East 53rd St., a 195,326 square feet. In total, those signed leases and leases in negotiation represent just over $55 million of revenue. The timing of the revenue recognition of the leases is consistent with our previous expectations and significantly weighted to the fourth quarter of 2019. We can control when the leases get signed. We can\u2019t control when the tenants build out their space.","In the second quarter, we completed 420,000 square feet of leasing in our Midtown portfolio that included 300,000 square-foot of expansions and extensions at 601 Lex and 599 Lex, and it included 75,000 square feet of what I describe as 399. Overall activity in the Midtown market continues to be strong and the brokers we work with confirm that the activity we are seeing is consistent with the overall market. The result has been a change in mood and affirming of lease economics. The leasing activity continues to be led by the buyer sector which continues to enjoy the advantages of that Midtown Manhattan offers.","Base building construction at Dock 72 is winding down and we are building out the amenity space offerings. WeWork has commenced construction of its tenant work with an expected completion by early 2019. We have a few ongoing dialogues, which is a slight improvement from last quarter. For Brooklyn, large tenant activity has been light and tenants have a more of a just-in-time perspective. So, we don\u2019t expect much leasing until the amenity spaces are closer to completed at the end of this year.","Market fundamentals continue to improve in San Francisco. There is no new product for lease in 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021, now that a single user has leased the entire 755,000 square-foot of Park Tower. The next new product to deliver will be a first admission in 2022 or beyond, and 270,000 square-foot rehab expansion that just commenced at 633 Fulton. The large blocks of contiguous available sublet space stemming from tenants that are moving to new construction are disappearing. The Dropbox sublet space, 300,000-plus square-foot has been leased and we believe the Salesforce sublet at Rincon Center and 405 Howard which are about 200,000 square feet each are also committed. As we move into the back half of \u201818 and \u201819 our CBD activities in Embarcadero Center where we\u2019ve commenced our major refresh of the public areas and amenities. ","This quarter, we completed 109,000 square feet of office leasing in DC, including 60,000 square feet of the space made available from bank consultants move to Salesforce Tower. We have four noncontiguous full floors at EC4 and may have the opportunity for the 60,000 square-foot 3-foot block at the top of EC4 together next year. Full floor financial or business service demand isn\u2019t as robust as the tech-led growth, but it is feeling the pressure from the lack of availability, which should lead to very favorable pricing. There has been a reduction in inventory of traditional space as landlords, including Boston Properties speculatively build more creative office in existing traditional building. There have been significant increases in rents for large block availability geared toward a tech tenant since they\u2019ve been based on new construction economics. Rent growth in older towers which are traditional build-outs are also higher but at rates that are still lower than a new construction inventory. It\u2019s a great value.","The Silicon Valley has also seen a pickup in activity. There have been over 4 million square feet of deals in the first half of the year from leases in excess of 100,000 square feet, the majority of which has been growth. The existing Class A inventory is being absorbed. The latest megadeal being 1 million square-foot, at Moffett Tower in Sunnyvale for buildings that will be delivered in 2019. We did another 80,000 square feet of leasing this quarter at our single-storey product in Mountain View where the average rents increased more than 100% and starting rents are in the mid-50s, triple net.","We are also responding to a multi-building build-to-suit opportunity at the station on North First. While we didn\u2019t sign another development deal build-to-suit in DC this quarter, we did complete 650,000 square feet of leasing. The activity is concentrated in Reston where we signed 435,000 square feet and we continue to see strong, growing demand from our incumbent tenants. Today, we have 500,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation. In the second quarter, we completed a 235,000 square-foot renewal at Democracy Tower, which included a tenant recapturing 76,000 square feet of previously sublet base. We had a cyber security company signed a 50,000 square-foot lease including 15,000 square feet of expansion and an internet analytics company renewed on 84,000 square feet.","We\u2019re working on new leases and renewals with software and web services companies as well as defense contractors and engineering firms. Owen mentioned our second residential project in Reston, which came on line this quarter. We\u2019ve leased about 178 of the 508 units, while at the same time improving the year-over-year occupancy of the 359-unit Avant project right around the corner, which ended the quarter at 95% occupancy with a 1.5% increase in year-to-year rents in the face of trying to lease 508 other units. In the district, we completed an expansion and an extension with WeWork at Met Square, our 20%-80% JV with Blackstone. Our other CBD activity was limited in the portfolio.","It continues to be a very competitive Class A market and we actually expect the potential buyer of 1333 New Hampshire to renovate and operate the building at a more moderately price position. This is not an area of the market in which we at Boston Properties concentrate, hence the decision to exit the asset. 1333 New Hampshire, you\u2019ll remember, was the one asset that we identified at our investor conference that we were considering for a gut renovation at major project where the only remaining component of the building was going to be its structure. This is obviously a change in plan.","Owen described our expansion into the Santa Monica Business Park. The last few quarters, the corporate M&A deals surrounding HBO, Disney, Fox, Comcast, Hulu changes in ownership have really been weighing on deal activities. Nonetheless, there has been and continues to be large block activity. The shared office companies have been very active. We\u2019re tracking over 0.5 million square feet of transactions that are either completed or underway at six individual assets on the West Side. At Colorado Center, we completed 130,000 square feet extension with one of our tenants during the quarter. And last week, we leased the remaining large block of space at Colorado Center 58,000 square feet at Bird, the scooter company or the -- I guess what they call them to the motorized scooter company, which brings our occupancy there to 98%.","The tightest market in our portfolio continues to be Boston. The percentage leased in our Boston regional office assets is the strongest at 95% in total. We do not have a single vacant floor in our Boston CBD portfolio. When we started the quarter, we had one floor left at 888 Boylston. We signed one lease, expect the second to be executed this week, which will leave us with a whopping 3,300 square feet in the building. You\u2019ll note that our leasing percentage is now 88% at the Hub on Causeway and next quarter you\u2019ll see that 100 Causeway is included in our statistics at 70% leased.","Our largest negotiation in the region right now involves this piece of place that\u2019s expiring in 2022. Demand for space in Boston from growing technology tenants is a strong as we have ever seen. This quarter, the Back Bay had major absorption with a 400,000 square-foot expansion by Wayfair and 100,000 square-foot lease with DraftKings. In addition, Amazon is expanding by taking a 430,000 square-foot building in the Seaport, little less than the 440,000 square-foot building that Bryan is building over at The Hub.","In Cambridge, where we have limited availability, our activity is centered at the Proto apartment building. We opened up the Proto 45 days ago in Cambridge. We\u2019ve leased 82 out of 244 market rate units and 8 of 36 affordable units. Even as many tenants are attracted to the center cities of Boston and Cambridge, there continues to be significant demand in our Waltham, Lexington suburban. We signed the lease for the entire availability at Reservoir North, 73,000 square feet with a tenant that is upgrading out of a 30,000 square-foot B building owned by a local developer and we are in negotiations with two tenants for 70,000 square feet of the remaining 100,000 at 20 CityPoint.","Our active construction projects, including the recent delivery of the Signature, total about $3.5 billion. We\u2019ve signed construction contracts at fixed cost for all of those projects. With the 100 Causeway Street announcement, we have another $1.4 billion of development that is in design and will be bid in the next 12 months. Changes in tariff rates and other headwinds in the construction industry are things we are mindful of when we give our budget and agree to future fixed leases for these new projects. All of our budgets include, both contingencies and cost escalation estimates to manage these types of events. While we have seen an impact on certain components of our projects, our allowances are sized to manage these risks and they are all component of the total investing estimates that we provided in our disclosure in our supplemental package that we haven\u2019t covered.","I\u2019m going to conclude my remarks with some comments about the same-store statistics for the quarter. Boston and San Francisco had very strong rollup, 44% and 35% net respectively across their portfolios on about 335,000 square feet. New York City is down on a very small pool, mostly from leases at 599 Lex. And Washington DC is down from the 230,000 square-foot renewal we did at Democracy Tower in Reston where the initial market rents are usurped by the effect of the 3% annual rent bumps in operating expense escalations that are embedded in the prior 10-year lease. On an earnings basis, the rent is about the same.","I\u2019ll stop there and turn it over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody.","With all the transactions we completed this quarter, Owen and Doug had a lot of ground to cover. I\u2019m going to try to describe the financial impact and talk about the quarter.","So, we had a solid second quarter as we exceeded our earnings guidance and we are raising our full-year 2018 estimates. Our second quarter funds from operations came in at a $1.58 per share that\u2019s $0.04 per share above the midpoint and $0.02 per share above the high-end of our prior guidance range.","Our portfolio exceeded our estimate by $4 million, about $0.02 per share and it was primarily related to lower operating expenses for the quarter. The majority of these expenses were repair and maintenance items that now will be incurred later this year and will not represent savings to the full-year. Our development fee income also exceeded our budget for the quarter by about a penny or $1.5 million. The majority of the increase is from earning leasing commissions from our joint venture portfolio that included deals closed at Colorado Center, Metropolitan Square and the Hub on Causeway. And lastly, our interest expense was slightly lower than our assumption due to higher capitalized interest on our development pipeline and major capital projects.","As you can see in our supplemental report, our second quarter same-property NOI was down 3.3% on a cash basis compared to the second quarter of 2017. This performance was as we expected and it was in line with our prior same-property guidance and it\u2019s primarily due to the move-outs at 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2017 that we have discussed. We project our cash same-property results will improve in the back half of the year as the income from this space is fully out of the prior year period. And as Doug described, we are well on our way to re-leasing the space.","As we look at the rest of 2018, we are seeing solid leasing activity in the portfolio, which we expect to result in higher top-line revenues than our prior projection. This includes several renewals in Embarcadero Center and our Mountain View portfolio with increases in rents that will start to flow through our numbers this year. In New York City, we signed a two-floor expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue for space that expires in the fourth quarter that we had expected to be vacant. In Reston Town Center, Doug described the renewal and expansion activity we\u2019ve achieved. And in Santa Monica, we\u2019ve had similar success, completing 130,000 square-foot, early renewal with large rent increase and leasing an incremental 60,000 square feet which is nearly all of our vacancy at Colorado Center. These deals will start to hit our revenues later this year and primarily impact our straight line rents due to pre-rent periods and being early renewals where the cash rent increase comes at naturally expiration.","We\u2019ve increased our assumptions for straight line rents in 2018. However, we\u2019ve not changed our assumptions for 2018 same-property NOI growth as we expect we will still end up within the current ranges. So, despite giving back most of our second quarter outperformance from deferring operating expenses into the second half of the year, we anticipate our full-year portfolio NOI will be a penny per share higher than our previous assumptions from higher revenues.","In our non-same-property portfolio, we closed on the $627 million acquisition of Santa Monica Business Park in July. As Owen described, we completed our capital structure by bringing in CPP as a 45% partner and closing $300 million of mortgage financing at a fixed rate of just over 4%. A portion of the property is subject to a ground lease which we have accounted for as a capital lease due to our right to purchase the land in 10 years.","The net contribution to our 2018 FFO is approximately $0.02 per share, including the impact of the ground lease expense and the mortgage interest expense. We also closed on the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue, a fully leased suburban office building located in Lexington, Massachusetts. The lost income from selling 91 Hartwell costs us about $1 million of NOI in 2018.","We have increased our assumptions for development and management services income in 2018 by $6 million to a new range of $37 million to $42 million for the year. In addition to exceeding our second quarter budget, we have two additional one-time, leasing commissions we expect to book later this year. And we also start recognizing fee income from Santa Monica Business Park in the second half of the year. As part of our investment in 3 Hudson Boulevard, we originated an $80 million loan to refinance an existing land loan secured by the site. This is an opportunistic low leverage secured loan that will generate interest income at a positive spread to our corporate debt cost and reduce our overall carrying cost in the investment.","We have modified our 2018 net interest assumptions, partially to account for the interest income for the loan. Our new range for 2018, net interest expense is $363 million to $375 million, representing a reduction of $3.5 million at the midpoint. So, for the full-year 2018, we are raising our guidance range for funds from operation to $6.36 to $6.41 per share, an increase of $0.07 per share at the midpoint. The increase in our guidance is from $0.03 per share of higher projected portfolio NOI which includes Santa Monica Business Park, $0.03 per share of higher fee income and $0.02 per share from lower net interest expense offset by the loss of a $0.01 per share from the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue. ","Our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions or dispositions. We are in the market to sell 1333 New Hampshire in Washington DECLINED, and if we\u2019re successful, we will likely close later this year. The property currently contributes approximately $10 million to our annual FFO. So, if we were to close on the sale at the end of the third quarter 2018, it will reduce FFO by less than $0.02 per share and 2019 FFO by about $0.06 per share.","Looking out to 2019, we anticipate strong FFO growth with a sizable component of our development pipeline delivering during the year. We still anticipate that all of the revenue from the leasing at Salesforce Tower will be commenced by the end of the third quarter of 2019. Both 145 Broadway in Cambridge and the Hub on Causeway podium development will deliver in the back half of 2019, and we project incremental growth from the lease-up of our two residential developments that delivered this year.","Doug described in detail the activity on the leasing front in the portfolio with a significant driver of growth over the next two years being the lease-up of 399 Park Avenue where we currently have 480,000 square feet of high-value vacancy. We have signed leases or letters of intent on nearly all of this space. As a reminder, the majority of the income will not commence until later in 2019 as the space becomes occupied.","However, we\u2019ve made great progress in achieving our goal of having all of this space leased in 2018. The projected growth in our property NOI will be partially offset by higher interest expense in 2019. The capitalized interest for our developments delivering will drop off. And although we continue to add new projects to the pipeline, they will be funded primarily with incremental debt which will offset the capitalized interest related to the development funding.","In addition, a 100% of the capitalized interest associated with Salesforce Tower will stop at the end of 2018, even though revenues from the project will not stabilize until third quarter 2019. We will also have interest expense for our new investments including Santa Monica Business Park, 3 Hudson Yards, and the anticipated acquisition of Hines 5% interest in Salesforce Tower. We have started discussions with Hines and expect to close sometime in late 2018 or early 2019.","So, while we will not be giving detailed 2019 guidance until next quarter, we want to stress that we\u2019re delivering on all of the growth opportunities that we have been describing over the past year. And we remain confident in our plan to materially increase our NOI, starting in 2019.","That completes what we wanted to cover formally. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that will be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wondered, Doug, you discussed two sort of potential big projects in New York, one on Madison and the other in Hudson Yards, both of which required big preleasing before you go vertical. Can you tell us about the discussions with tenants on both those projects, maybe the type of tenants and their desire to be at one or the other and how those projects will differ?","Owen Thomas","Yes. Manny, good morning. It\u2019s Owen. So, first of all, the projects are on a very different time schedule. So, the 3 Hudson Boulevard is entitled and ready to go. We\u2019re actually working on the foundation to try to improve our speed to market. 343 Madison is in the entitlement process and will not be ready for any kind of new development or tenant conversations for some time. So, I think that\u2019s the first point. And the second point is, we are in the market with 3 Hudson Boulevard. We are -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we certainly are seeking a very significant tenant to launch the project. We have JLL engaged that\u2019s working on our behalf to help us with this. And we are engaged -- we have been engaged and are engaging in those dialogues.","John, is there anything more you would like to say about that? John Powers who is one phone. John? We didn\u2019t hear you.","John Powers","Sorry. So, the MTA site is in the future, as you said, that has to go through the unit [ph] process. And we have some issues between the city and the state regarding the taxes that have to get sorted out first. So, as you said, that\u2019s very much in the future. And we just signed up 3 Hudson Boulevard, and we are very excited with JLL and we\u2019re starting to meet with people now.","Manny Korchman","Great. And then, switching to the West Coast, I think it\u2019s new to us that you\u2019re buying out -- the Hines, Salesforce Tower. Can you tell us is there a contractual deal there or why you sort of try to buy that small stake in the building?","Mike LaBelle","Sure. So, when we set the deal up originally, we gave Hines, the ability to effectively sell their interest upon stabilization. And they\u2019ve indicated that that\u2019s something that they would like us to consider doing. And so, we are entering into a thoughtful dialogue with them about what the value of their interest is, and they haven\u2019t promoted position based upon performance of the property. And we will come to some sort of a successful conclusion hopefully in the next couple of months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Just curious on 3 Hudson. You gave the comp at 10 Hudson. I\u2019m just curious where you think your all-in costs and development return comes in 3 Hudson relative to kind of the stabilized value at 10 Hudson?","Owen Thomas","Okay. I don\u2019t know a thing about what the stabilized value is for 10 Hudson other than what the purchase price was. So, it\u2019s hard to comment on that. We believe\u2026","Craig Mailman","Forecast...","Owen Thomas","So, we believe that at the appropriate time with the appropriate tenant, we are going to be able to generate a return somewhere near what we\u2019ve been executing on all of our other developments. The amount of space that we have to lease and the amount of speculative risk that we have to take will be obviously a key determinant in what goes on there. And we are in a position where we are -- we believe it will cost somewhere between $1,300 and $1,400 a square-foot to build that building based upon the sort of market comps for our cost for construction, for TIs, for interest carry. When we start the building and what the escalation of those costs are going to be will obviously impact those numbers. Where rents will be will impact those numbers. So, we\u2019re not in a position today to say the cost is going to be x dollars per square foot and the return is going to be x percent because there are too many unknowns from a timing perspective.","Craig Mailman","And given how far along you guys are on the foundation, what do you think, if you guys were to get a significant prelease kind of the delivery time would be from here?","Owen Thomas","So, the schedule that we have right now on is somewhere between 36 and 40 months from the construction go date, once the foundation has completed to having a tenant physically in the building.","Craig Mailman","And then, just last one for me. Just curious your updated thoughts here on WeWork and exposure to kind of coworking in general as this tenant in particular kind of branches out into other areas of the real estate spectrum. Does that at all change your view on more exposure to this tenant or kind of how do you look at them as a tenant versus competitor at this point?","Owen Thomas","WeWork is an important customer of Boston Properties. In the supplemental, you\u2019ll see they\u2019re 14th on the sheet now in terms of their size, they\u2019re about 0.9% of income. And we are selectively talking to them about additional stores that they would put in our buildings. As Doug described, we\u2019re getting pretty full. So, there are less of those opportunities today. But, we -- for the right building and for the right situation, we would certainly consider expanding our relationship with WeWork.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Owen, nice quarter. You mentioned twice conserving public equity capital. Does that mean that you would not issue equity at any price because it just increases denominator too much and makes it too difficult to move the needle or that there is a price that you would rather issue commons and do -- use JV equity?","Owen Thomas","John, given where the stock price is trading, which is we think a very material discount to the value of the underlying assets and at a rough breakeven yield in the low-5, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an attractive market to raise capital at this juncture. And much better way to do it -- the best way to do it right now for us is debt financing because we are creating debt capacity with all the developments that we\u2019re delivering, and that the cost of the debt is much -- certainly much lower than issuing public equity. Now, I think the other point I would make is if we get pushed in terms -- we don\u2019t want to increase the leverage of the company and if we require more capital, we would certainly continue to access the private equity market for real estate. We just demonstrated with the Santa Monica deal that we have great access to that and have another great capital partner in one of our buildings. So, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Public equity is at the bottom of our list in terms of where we want to go raise capital.","John Guinee","Great, okay. And then, Mike LaBelle, your midpoint for 3Q is about a $1.62, your implied midpoint for 4Q is about a $1.70. Can you talk about how you get from $1.62 to $1.70? And then second. Is $1.70 a good floor when I think about quarter by quarter for 2019.","Mike LaBelle","One thing to think about is there is some one-time leasing commissions, one time kind development fees that are in the back half of this year. So, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be able to have the same level of kind of development fee income and leasing commissions next year. So, that\u2019s something that may not recur. With regard to kind of our -- as we move through, our development will continue to kind of add incremental every quarter. So, we\u2019re gaining occupancy at Salesforce Tower every quarter and it\u2019s going to move in, occupy their space, and then suddenly we can recognize revenue. Even though we\u2019ve -- in many of these cases, we\u2019ve been getting cash from these tenants for months and months and months, we can\u2019t recognize the revenue until they finish their space. And then, obviously, we have the two residential properties that are coming in as well. The other kind of difference between the third and the fourth quarter is the summer months have higher expenses where we operate, so utilities in particular are higher. And so, in the fourth quarter, you will see some benefit from that in the fourth quarter.","John Guinee","And then, last question, if I may. You said something very interesting, Owen. You said, your land at 2 Hudson -- or 3 Hudson was $360 per FAR, but significantly less on a net rentable square foot basis. Can you give a quick tutorial on the difference between FAR and net rentable square foot for a building like that?","Owen Thomas","John, it\u2019s related to the ratio between the rentable square foot -- square feet and the usable square feet and how the ultimate configuration of the building is. And the latter part of that is yet to be determined. But, the price per rentable square foot is lower than $360.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just two questions. First, Mike LaBelle, as we look to 2019, I just want to get clarification on two items. One, it sounded like the sale -- well, you guys have discussed it before and now it sounds like the sale of 1333 New Hampshire is something new that we want to incorporate into our models for next year? And then, second is, based on all the leasing that Doug described at 399 and 159, and the fact that you guys I think expect this all to really hit in the fourth quarter of next year. Is that consistent with what you guys have previously laid out at the Investor Day and earlier in the year at NAREIT or has some of that timing from revenue recognition been pushed back?","Mike LaBelle","The timing with regard to the New York City leasing is in line with what we have expected and what we\u2019ve kind of talked about before. We feel like we are meeting exactly what our plan is with regard to the deals that we\u2019re working on and when those deals will come into the revenue picture. I mean, the vast majority of the space has been demolished. So, it has to be rebuilt. And these tenants will take anywhere between 9 and 12 months to kind of get into that space. And some of these tenants obviously have a lease expiry. So, they may not be in a tremendous rush. So, they signed a lease in the third quarter of 2018, but their lease expiration is until the end of 2019. They may be able to build out that space. But they may move fairly slowly, because they really don\u2019t need to be in that space until closer to their lease expiration.","So, we are right in line with what our expectations have been on that. And then, with -- and also with the development pipeline by the way. We\u2019ve provided guidance as to kind of what the development pipeline is going to be delivering in the next couple of years. And we are in line with our expectations in terms of delivering those spaces and getting that rent started. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any change to that. On 1333, we\u2019ve talked about it before that we would consider selling it. It\u2019s now on the market and we\u2019re talking to potential buyers. So, I would say, it\u2019s much more likely that we will be successful in selling that asset than it would have been last quarter. So, that is a change. We have not included in our guidance yet because we just don\u2019t do it until it\u2019s done. But that\u2019s why I wanted to point out because I do think it\u2019s more likely than not that that\u2019s going to happen.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then, the second question is for Ray Ritchey. Ray, just speaking to some brokers down in DC recently, mentioned about a pending uptick in government leasing, whether it\u2019s possibly something with the FBI but just sort of some pent-up demand from government for leasing. So, could you just comment on what you\u2019re hearing and seeing in the DC market, just given that it\u2019s been a tough -- it\u2019s been a great development market but a tough landlords market?","Ray Ritchey","Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think, the FBI is still very much in question about whether they go forward or not. Our President has made it one of his personal agendas. And given everything else he faces, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like number one on his target [ph] to get started. In terms of GSA leasing in general, when you have something along the lines of 26 million square feet of lease expirations the next three to four years, something\u2019s got to be done. However, it is still priced at a point that makes new development very, very challenging. So, we tend to see I think a lot of renewals, a lot of short-term extensions to keep the government in place with no major moves, I think on the GSA side, but certainly not the downturn we\u2019ve seen in past cycles.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Doug, great to hear about all the activity at 399 and 159. So, can you just frame out about how much of that $55 million incremental NOI is under contract versus under negotiation or LOI? And maybe handicap the possibility of any of those leases that are outside walking away at this point?","Owen Thomas","So, there is 700,000 square feet, 140,000 of it is signed. I expect that there is another 200,000 that will get signed before Friday. So, that will get to that 340,000 square feet or just about half of it. And the other two major leases are actively being negotiated. And I think our expectation is they are going to get done.","Blaine Heck","Mike, same-store NOI guidance implies around 5% in the back half of the year, assuming there\u2019s not a lot of noise in the same-store pool. So, can you just talk about how we should think about that sequentially? Is it going to ramp up through the end of the year or kind of jump in the third quarter and stay elevated?","Mike LaBelle","I think, it\u2019s going to move up but it\u2019s mostly going to be in the fourth quarter. The 399 space was not all out of the portfolio until midway through the third quarter, I guess last year. So that\u2019s still going to be in there for a part of next quarter. So, I think that it will be better than it was this quarter, and then the fourth quarter will be even better than that to achieve within the range that we provided in our supplemental.","Blaine Heck","And then, last one for me. On 3 Hudson, just coming back to that one. Can you guys just give any specifics or a range around the preleasing hurdle you guys might have there, given the supply picture on the West Side? And maybe a little more color on how you guys are viewing demand for additional new construction in Manhattan at this point in the cycle?","Doug Linde","Let me try to answer this. Owen\u2019s tried [ph] and maybe you didn\u2019t find it satisfactory. So, I\u2019ll try a different tact, which it\u2019s all going to depend on who the tenant is, how long the lease is, what they are doing in the building, where they are in the building and how much they are paying. So, there is no number. I can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t tell you that if a 650,000 square-foot tenant showed up, we would do the deal; and I can\u2019t tell you if a 1 million square-foot tenant show, we wouldn\u2019t do the deal. So, we\u2019re not in a position because we just don\u2019t know the facts around leases. But, it\u2019s going to be a big number. And we are -- I think Owen has described in previous quarters that as we move on in the cycle, we have toned down our risk tolerance for speculative space. And so, that I think -- those are the things that we\u2019re judging as we think about what we need to lease the building, but there is no number.","Owen Thomas","And the only thing I would add to what Doug said is in terms of the marketplace, look, it is a thin market to find a tenant of the scale that Doug is describing. There are tenants out there that are interested in new construction that our of scale. The good news is, there is not that many options for such a tenant. And we do think that this is one of the absolute best large tenant sites in New York. So, we will be accessing that demand as the market evolves in the coming quarters.","Blaine Heck","Okay, appreciate the color. That\u2019s very satisfactory at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Rob Simone","Just a follow-up on the same-store guidance question from earlier. And I know, you guys obviously aren\u2019t talking about \u201819 yet. But just kind like of piecing that question together with the fact that most of the cash revenues isn\u2019t going to starting hitting your P&L until the fourth quarter of next year. Is there any reason to assume, are there any kind of like one-timers or large leases that could result in whatever you guys print in the fourth quarter on a same-store basis, kind of being not being the run rate through the majority of \u201819?","Owen Thomas","We\u2019ve done a number of early renewals over the last couple of years in San Francisco, in Cambridge, in Boston. And those were deals that were expiring in \u201818, \u201819, \u201820. We\u2019ve got some embedded kind of casting growth that is going to come out of that stuff, in addition to the increase that we\u2019ll get when we refill and get cash started at 399.","Rob Simone","Got it. So, it could -- it sounds -- like based upon that, it sounds like it could be higher potentially versus Q4, just trying to read the tea leaves there.","Mike LaBelle","We can\u2019t really give guidance right now for what it\u2019s going to be in 2019. But, I do feel like we\u2019ve got some embedded growth that we\u2019ve talked about that is coming and that our AFFO will be better in 2019 than it is in 2018.","Rob Simone","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And just a quick follow-up. It sounds like -- and you guys have been pretty clear about this. Interest expense being a pretty significant swing factor for next year. And I was just wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. That it sounds like there\u2019s lower net interest expense for the back half of the year of about $0.02. Is that all attributable to the loan you guys originated on 3 Hudson or is there something else kind of in there that\u2019s moving it around.","Mike LaBelle","It\u2019s a little more capitalized interest, and we had a little bit more cash than we expected. So, it\u2019s kind of on the margin. But, for next year, I think, it is important for people to understand that Salesforce Tower I think right now is 28% in service or something like that. So, there\u2019s still 72% capitalized interest on $1 billion project. And it goes away on 12\/31\/18. And again, the income is going to be coming in throughout \u201819. But there\u2019s kind of a mismatch there that I\u2019m not sure people fully understand. Typically, you kind of model that -- the capitalized interest goes away, as the income goes away and there\u2019s kind of a match there. But gap rules require us to cut it off 12 months from the date that the building is delivered. And that\u2019s great, if you have a 300,000 square-foot building that you\u2019re delivering, because you can deliver 300,000 square foot with the space and build it out within 12 months. But when you\u2019re building a 1.4 million square foot building, even though it\u2019s 98% leased, it just takes longer to get all those tenants built. So, for these very, very large buildings, there tends to be kind of a mismatch. So, I think that\u2019s an impact that we have.","And then, the other thing is that we are going to be using, as you move into \u201819, we are going to be using debt for nearly all of the new development funding that we do. So, that debt is going to be roughly equal to what we\u2019re capitalizing. So, we\u2019re going to kind of lose what we deliver this year. So, that does have a pretty significant impact on the interest expense. The other item that also affects \u201819 and I mentioned it last quarter, I didn\u2019t mention it this quarter, but it\u2019s these -- the counting change for the leasing costs. So, as I mentioned last quarter, that\u2019s $0.04 to $0.06 negative to us in \u201819 versus \u201818. So, that\u2019s another thing to just keep in mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Doug, you mentioned the obvious that you can\u2019t control the build out timing of the space and speaking specifically at 399. I\u2019m wondering, as you\u2019re going through the kind of these -- just buttoning up this leasing process there. If you\u2019re paying attention to the individual circumstances, I\u2019m sure you are of incoming potential tenants in terms of where they\u2019re at now, what their sense of urgency would be to build out the space, so that you don\u2019t have a situation where you\u2019re waiting to recognize revenue because they\u2019re taking longer than you had hoped to get into the space?","Doug Linde","We are absolutely are cognizant of those issues. And in some cases, we hope the tenants are actually in a rush to build out their space, and in fact one of the cases, they are. Still going to take them 12 plus months to start their design, get their construction permits, bid it and then build it out. So, the timeframes are not going to be significantly different than what we anticipate. But, we are clearly cognizant of that and we know when their lease expirations are. And so, we know how much \u201ctime they have between the leases\u201d. The other issue is that in certain cases, because these are financial services companies for the most part, there\u2019s a commissioning of the space that also needs to occur with all their systems, because they\u2019re -- they can\u2019t simply shut down on a Friday and moving on Monday by moving their computers. They actually have to rebuild and basically start up. And so, the good news is that will hopefully drive them to be more cognizant of getting in their space a little earlier than they would otherwise.","Rich Anderson","Do you have some negotiating leverage, if they\u2019re like literally taking way too long, where at some point they just -- you just get to start recognizing revenue, if it lags on to too far into the future?","Owen Thomas","At some point, it\u2019s deemed that they\u2019re already paying cash rent and it\u2019s deemed that they\u2019re not going to be building out anytime soon. We can start to make the argument that we should be able to turn revenue on. Because obviously it doesn\u2019t make sense to wait until the last day of the lease and suddenly recognize 10 years worth of lease in one day. So, yes, those situations -- they have occurred. There\u2019s people that kind of take space protectively and they don\u2019t build it out right away. And we have to make some judgment decisions in those.","Rich Anderson","Second question is a larger picture. A lot of talk about being in later part of this real estate cycle. And I always get the question why should I own REITs, if that\u2019s the case. And I\u2019m curious how you might respond to that question. And are you feeling some added pressure to button some of these leases up before the music stops, be it economically or what have you that might influence a slowing down of this current nine-year cycle?","Owen Thomas","On your question a couple of reactions. I mean, first of all, are we in the ninth inning of whatever of this economic cycle\u2026","Rich Anderson","We are in the ninth year, so not to use the baseball analogy.","Owen Thomas","Yes. I don\u2019t have a clear crystal ball on this. I even mentioned in my remarks that we don\u2019t see a downturn at imminent. We are clearly -- our instinct is we are closer to the end and the beginning but there are lots of positive things going on in the market. And I think there are some lags. So, that\u2019s one reaction.","The second is, when I think about at least our company and some extent is true with other companies, a lot of the growth that we\u2019ve been talking about on this call and in previous calls is not as economically sensitive as a typical corporation. So, a lot of the growth that we are going to experience as a company next year is delivering the Salesforce Tower which is 98% leased, and it\u2019s coming on our book. And I\u2019m not suggesting that an economic downturn wouldn\u2019t have some impact on our outcomes. But again, a lot of our growth is in developments that are leased in the 80s on percent basis. And our average lease term for the existing plan is over seven years. So, I think we are -- in terms of growth and results, less economically sensitive than a typical corporation. Also, certainly true of our company and others in our space, we think the stock is on sale relative to the value of the underlying assets. So, that should provide some kind of cushion.","And as also described earlier, in recognition of this lack of having a clear crystal ball, we are keeping our leverage low. We are not leveraging up the company and taking more risk by doing that. We are keeping the leverage low, which should allow us to weather any storms that might be out there and frankly take advantage of anything that comes up. In terms of pressure to do things. I mean, look, we always feel pressure to have our buildings flow and generate income. So, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve accelerated any leasing plans because of some downturn that we see as imminent. Doug and I have described over the last year or so that we have bumped our pre-letting requirements for development. And that is the way that we are expressing that we are later in the cycle and prepared to take a little bit less risk. So, I hope that helps you with the conversations you\u2019re having.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","One of your neighbors in San Francisco cited litigation expense this quarter in relation to Millennium Tower. And I didn\u2019t hear you guys really talk about this. But, are you involved in this case at all and experiencing similar costs?","Owen Thomas","We are absolutely involved in the case. I think, the TJPA, 350 Mission, every contractor who has put a shovel in the ground in and around that site over the last seven or eight years, every design professional is part of this. We are not going to comment on the litigation other than to say, we don\u2019t expect any material liability or we would have disclosed in our K and our Qs. And our legal expenses are being capitalized into Salesforce Tower at the moment. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see any \u201cdisclosure\u201d of what were spending.","John Kim","And as far as the resolution or the proposed resolution of fixing the problem, do you foresee any potential business interruption at Salesforce Tower?","Owen Thomas","All I can tell you is that we don\u2019t expect any material liability associated with this.","John Kim","Okay. At Santa Monica Business Park, could you enter acquiring this asset with CPP [ph] in mind as a partner? And if not, can you discuss what demand was like from other potential partners for this asset?","Owen Thomas","Yes. We did decide early in the process that we -- we thought we should bring in a capital partner in this particular acquisition for the reasons that we described which is to preserve our public equity capital. So, I think the decision to bring in a partner was made prior to us committing to the deal. And we talked about that on the last call. There was interest, certainly about CPP, but also about other potential partners in that particular investment. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, I think the private equity capital market for real estate is quite healthy and there are multiple investors that are underfunded in real estate and want more exposure.","John Kim","My final question is at Signature at Reston, it\u2019s now fully placed in service as far as multifamily, retail. You\u2019ve done some leasing progress there. But how are the effective rents and lease-up periods compared to your underwriting, just given the amount of supply and do you potential market in multifamily?","Doug Linde","So, John, I guess, I tried to describe what I think is going on, by basically saying that the existing apartment building across the street is actually at 95% occupied with an increase in rents year to year when the Signature was not open. My implication to that was that we are well in line with our pro forma rents. The leasing is progressing. I would say if you put a lie detector on me, I would say that we would have liked been slightly higher leased. But the fact of the matter is that we just opened up the retail at the base of the building. And when we started the building and did our pro forma, we didn\u2019t anticipate having signed a lease with [indiscernible] for 270,000 building across the street where there is a whole on the ground in a little bit of noise and construction activities. So, there is a little bit of self-inflicted slowdown in the lease-up that we had to get through, but we\u2019re actively moving through it.","Owen Thomas","I would just additional, just like the office market, the residential multifamily in the Town Center itself dramatically outperforms the general Northern Virginia market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","I just want to go back to Ray for a moment. I appreciate your thoughts on GSA. But, can you talk about the defense budget and the increase in spending and what you\u2019re seeing so far in terms of that translating into office demand? And what you think will happen going forward, given we\u2019re getting closer and closer to the end of the fiscal year?","Ray Ritchey","Yes. I think that we\u2019ve been under a contracting environment on the defense side for so long that even just a stay put on the budget or a modest increase would trigger demand. All these users have gotten down to an efficiency level that I don\u2019t think is sustainable. And we\u2019re seeing it Reston where we\u2019re receiving a lot of our defense contractors or people that are doing business with the government, major engineering companies are coming to us with some growth that is quite welcome related to what we\u2019ve seen over the last 7 or 8 years. So, yes, we\u2019re very positive about future demand. Very little spec space is being built, certainly the Dallas Corridor. So, as it relates to Reston, we think there\u2019s good signals ahead for increasing demand.","Jamie Feldman","And is the type of buildings these tenants are looking for different from prior cycles? I know Reston fits in well as high-amenity type location, like, it is different this time or do you think will go back to similar buildings?","Ray Ritchey","Yes. Just as, there is demand for talent in all of our markets, there is tremendous demand for talent in the Dallas Corridor. So, the concept of going to a Greenfield office park with no amenities to recruit and retain the best and brightest is not the right way to go in the Dallas Corridor. So, the same demand we\u2019re just seeing from corporate users, we\u2019re seeing from the defense. They want the amenity base we have in Reston town center.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you. And then, just the last question for me. Owen, to your comment about not raising leverage, do you -- are you thinking more about asset sales, might we see more dilution going forward from larger asset sales than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters?","Owen Thomas","Only non-core assets. As I mentioned, we are having a pretty active year selling non-core assets. So, I think we\u2019ll exceed the $300 million target. But, as I mentioned in my remarks, the selling of our -- most of our core assets involve a significant gain and a special dividend and a dilution to FFO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just on sort of the leasing progress for some of the other assets apart from 399, which you see pretty well on track there. Can you just -- maybe 70 million or 80 million of incremental, can you talk about at some of the other properties, 611 Gateway, Colorado Center, Embarcadero, just what\u2019s the sense of timing of lease-up for those assets?","Doug Linde","Yes. So, I will try and reiterate what I said. So, I\u2019ll start with a simple one. So, we\u2019ve already leased Colorado Center. And the revenue in Colorado Center is part of our slight increase for this year. So, we\u2019re 98% leased. So, there\u2019s not much to do there. At Embarcadero Center, I talked about the bank consulting space which is the one block that we had when the one tenant from the portfolio left to go to Salesforce Tower. There\u2019s a little bit of musical chairs going on because the tenant is taking spaces and existing and coming tenant, but we have another tenant outside of the project that\u2019s looking at that space. And we have -- again, we have these four floors at Embarcadero Center 4 that we are in two cases converting to, what I would refer to as more tech oriented space creative office. And so, we think we\u2019re going to be very successful in leasing that up and that construction is going to begin prior to the end of this year and hopefully be done before the end of the first quarter of 2019, which is where our major availability is there.","In Boston, I think, I described that we\u2019re 95% leased. So, there\u2019s not a lot to do there. 611 Gateway, we\u2019re leasing about 50,000 square feet a year right now. We actually have, probably get the 80,000 square feet in 2018, still leaves about 40,000 or 50,000 square feet of space that\u2019s going to be rented at $42 a square foot plus or minus, so $4 million or $1.6 million. So, it\u2019s not a lot of revenue. So that -- I think the rest of the portfolio is doing very well. We do have a few other pieces of high value space in New York City at the General Motors building. We actually have a lease out on the majority of one of the floors which we hope to sign in this calendar quarter. And that will likely have a revenue recognition sometime in late 2019 as well, and that\u2019s high revenue space. So, the rest of the portfolio is doing very well. If you force me to go back to 2016 and talk about our \u201crevenue bridge\u201d, we are within spitting distance of having everything done on that \u201c$160 million\u201d of revenue.","Vikram Malhotra","And then, just in New York, I guess, you referred to firming up or maybe stabilization in things like TIs et cetera. I\u2019m just sort of wondering, some of your peers have been optimistic about overall Midtown rents turning positive and maybe trending upward over the next six to nine months. Do you share that view and anything to share on your sense of where New York fundamentals would be over the next 6 to 12 months?","Doug Linde"," I think the house view -- and I\u2019ll let John give you his perspective, is that lease transaction economics in the form of pre-rent in TIs [ph] has stabilized. They are not coming down per se. And rents are flat and they are largely due to the fact that there continues to be a significant amount of new construction that\u2019s occurring. There are places where tenants can go. The better space is being leased and the better built space in those buildings that have gone through on major capital refreshment are the haves, and there are a bunch of have-nots out there. So, we think it\u2019s sort of steady as she goes. There is not going to be significant, if any rental rate expansion over the next few years. John, any other thought?","John Powers","No. I would say leasing activity is very strong. We had a very, very good first half of the year, but the development has added supply to the market. So, that\u2019s kept the availability rate from dropping with the leasing activity. And as a the result of that -- net result of that is what Doug says, it\u2019s a pretty flat market, although a very active one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Just going back to an earlier question about Santa Monica Business Park. That seems like an attractive addition to the portfolio and it\u2019s consistent with the strategy of growing in LA. Just given that, I wonder how you thought through the decision to partner on that asset rather than doing it a 100% on your own and kind of maximizing your LA presence, and why raising capital through that asset made more sense than just selling an incremental non-core asset? I know you touched briefly on that on the last call but if you could just expand on that a little bit.","Owen Thomas","Yes. When we sell a non-core -- when we sell a core asset, almost all of our core assets have a significant tax gain in them, so that creates a special dividend which we -- dividend to shareholders. We don\u2019t keep the money. So, we can\u2019t use that capital to make a new acquisition. So, it\u2019s extremely inefficient source of capital, in that if you look at it that way. So, in the case of Santa Monica, we thought it was a good opportunity to bring in a partner that -- we think the yield is attractive, it is lower on a stabilized basis than the developments than we are doing. So that was part of the decision. And we have a -- it\u2019s very active development pipeline and we want to keep our leverage at the current levels. And so, we thought it was an appropriate area to raise equity capital in the private market.","Jed Reagan","How about contrasting it to a non-core asset or lower growth asset where maybe you\u2019ve got sort of a stabilized cash flow versus potentially good upside for this asset?","Owen Thomas","Jed, the other point is, we have a partner in our other deal in Santa Monica as well. We didn\u2019t bring that one in, we inherited that because we bought a half interest. So, actually both our deals in Santa Monica are 50-50.","So, again, I\u2019d kind of go back to the first answer, the first question the, the sell on asset to raise money, given the tax basis in most of our assets we can\u2019t, if we did it, even if we get a great price, if we did it that we can\u2019t use most -- or a lot of the capital if not most of the capital to make new investments, that\u2019s not a source of funding for this kind of activity.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thanks. And there was a recent measure passed in San Francisco Prop C that would introduce 3.5% gross receipts tax on office landlords in town. Just curious to get your take on whether you think that measure is going to stand up ultimately. And if so, how much of the tax burden you think get passed along to tenants in the long run?","Doug Linde","So, I\u2019ll answer the question on the economics and I\u2019m going to not be able to give you my sense or our sense on the weather it will be repealed. It was a 51-49 vote for. It\u2019s unclear whether or not that will withstand both legal litigation as well as a revote if they were to do that. Our leases, we have structured, allow us to recover these types of increases in the costs associated with what I refer to as taxes. So, on the margin, we have vacant space. And so in those cases, there may be some revenue that we -- depending upon way all the leases are structured that would be pushed to the landlord, but vast majority of this is reimbursed.","Jed Reagan","And how about when the lease expires five years down the road?","Doug Linde","The new lease will have language in it that we believe will allow us to pass along this, pass probably in a more precise way.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And then maybe just a last one I think and related to that. There has been talk of getting new Prop M allocations added back to the Q and San Francisco to account for office buildings that have been converted to resi or other uses, maybe 1.5 million order of magnitude. Give me visibility into that process and the chances that it goes through and maybe how it could affect your plans?","Doug Linde","Sure. Bob, do you want to just describe what you -- what your understanding is and sort of where that \u201clegislation\u201d may be.","Bob Pester","Yes. Legislation has been submitted by supervisor Peskin, and we think it will pass. As far as our plans, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have any material impact because I think the city\u2019s going to divvy up the Prop M allocation amongst all the Central SoMa sites. ","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Hey, Ray Ritchey, you and -- I guess, you and LeBron James are active in LA now. Now that you\u2019ve been out there, west of the 405 Beverly Hills, Westwood, is it or is it not possible to do the new build?","Ray Ritchey","Well, that\u2019s -- of course Owen could comment on this as well. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re picking up sites like the Santa Monica Business Park. The barriers to entry in West LA are the strongest of any market we see in the country. And so, when we get a chance to acquire 40 some acres in Santa Monica and we will certainly jump on it. And given the success we\u2019ve had at Colorado Center where almost exactly two years ago, we bought it a 65% leased, we\u2019re effectively 100% today, just validates both the scarcity of sites and the unbelievable amount of tech demand in that marketplace. So, any chance we get to acquire any asset, be it a development site or a new acquisition, we\u2019re going to take advantage of it. But, the answer to your question specifically John, it\u2019s the tightest market in terms of developable sites we\u2019ve ever seen.","John Guinee","But, is it impossible or possible to up-zone, et cetera or is it just will we never see another square foot?","Ray Ritchey","The city Santa Monica, I\u2019d say it\u2019s virtually impossible to up-zone. OT, do you have any comment on that?","Owen Thomas","These things are hard to define, John. There\u2019s no question that what Ray described is accurate. And it\u2019s one of the attractiveness -- we think one of the attractive features of the investments that we\u2019ve made is there\u2019s a lot of protection in new supply. But, with time, you never know how these things are going to evolve and how the local community\u2019s posture toward these issues will evolve.","John Guinee","Thank you.","Owen Thomas","I\u2019m impressed you got back in the queue, John. How did you do that?","John Guinee","I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s divine, I think.","Owen Thomas","All right. Very good. I think that concludes all the questions for today, and thank all of you for your interest in Boston Properties.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call.

During the question-and-answer of our call, our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Okay, thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I will cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We have also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06.","In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent rollups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipated our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions.","Now, moving to the economy, U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year and estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revisions. The employment picture has been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June, but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%.","Now, economically, the most significant news for the quarter was the UK surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We have also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There is already evidence of a slowdown in the UK economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and central banks in Europe and the UK are all signaling an accommodated posture. Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near-term. The 10-year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result.","Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%. Asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year, but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers.","So, how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain Presidential election in November? First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new developments. Second, we will focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring pre-leasing for new office developments, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels.","Moving to private market real estate valuation, we believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we have seen a number of transactions in addition to what I have discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square which is a 645,000 square foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate, though the sales did include a 173,000 square foot development site. The buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully let to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the peers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco and this was sold to a U.S. pension advisor. And in L.A, 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold in separate transactions to U.S. REITs possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at mid-3s cap rates in approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spreads widen with decreasing interest rates and risks the European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets.","Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So, let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls it\u2019s located one block from Bergamot Station on the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica.","Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased, which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot and renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease the property. So, the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%, upon full lease up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers\u2019 owns the other 50% of Colorado Center and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with Teachers as part of this investment.","In addition to the financial aspects of transaction, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West LA as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We have hired the onsite property management staff and Ray Ritchie is providing senior-level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles efforts. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. Lastly, I am also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center and Doug is going to provide more details on this.","Now on dispositions, we are in the market with VA 95, our 11 building 740,000 square foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We are pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. Moving to development, we remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we are competing for a 630,000 square foot office build-to-suit for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We are also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for our 195,000 square foot office building.","We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we are in advanced discussions with an office user to fully pre-lease a 400,000 plus square foot office building which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center.","It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur BART Station in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high quality units at approximate a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16 minute transit ride from the Embarcadero station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement.","This past quarter, we also delivered three projects fully into service including 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, cost $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the properties is at a much lower cap rate, deliver of these projects again demonstrates the value creation power of our development platform.","Now given the deliveries, at the end of the second quarter our development pipeline now consists of eight new projects and one redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% pre-leased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in service portfolio to add materially to our company\u2019s growth over the next 3 years.","So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO to the lease up of existing assets and the delivery of new buildings through development. We have selected non-core assets for sales to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and un-entitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in the coming quarters.","So with that, let me turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. Owen touched on the global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things altogether, these issues elevate uncertainty and volatility and may impact capital spending decisions. In our business, a long-term lease is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you listen to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly updates that are put out by the leasing brokerage community, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tight labor conditions in the construction industry has pushed up the price of tenant improvement work. So it\u2019s easier today to delay all these commitments and it\u2019s cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew.","So let me give you some specific of our reasons and I am going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at EC. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing. And as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark to market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that were reported in our quarterly supplemental. Yet at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the levels of 2014 and early 2015 and there are couple of explanations for this.","First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not the experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripe, Slack, LinkedIn, were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansions. Yet there is still growing tech demand in the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe also down blocks of about 100,000 square feet and during the second quarter Lift, Fitbit, Travana, Expedia, Reddit combined have leased over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet Twitch, NerdWallet and Meraki are those.","Second and mostly recently, high quality well built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. Three of the four largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active, if you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter. Overall, venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Seed in early stage investing is down from the prior year and first time, investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants.","Finally, financial services and professional services firms continued at best to be neutral demand generators. At Salesforce Tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor and we expect to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of \u201817 and then we have four future delivery dates that extend out into the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenants has completed their build out on a floor by floor basis. Even though we are going to be receiving cash rent. So at this point, we think it\u2019s prudent for modeling purposes to assume no NOI in 2017 as startup operating expenses will offset any revenue.","We had an extremely active quarter in the New York City region while statistically, overall midtown market activity was a little bit light, we think it\u2019s largely because renewals have been prevalent and they are really not that typically included in the leasing activity as measured by the major brokerage firms.","Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals in expansions at 399 Park Avenue. We have now released 155,000 square feet of the 2017 City Bake Office explorations and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis explorations. The overall rent up in these spaces was about 2%, which is very consistent with my past remarks, where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City rollup was about 14%.","Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. On July 1, two full floor high-rise floors at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes at between $80 and $125 a square foot, the vastly above this is a little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the two General Motors floors. We have shown the space and we have issued proposal to a number of tenants for portions of these floors. The most exciting news at the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic experience for their brand, the building and the city when they open.","At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour sometime in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining and it will likely become part of one of the other retailing units at the building. We don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease, but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projections. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was subject to our lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in raw condition and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation, which will likely not occur until the end of \u201817 or early \u201818. All of our remaining pre-built suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the two remaining floors at the top of the building to create additional inventory.","At the June NAREIT meetings, we have got a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between \u201816 and \u201819, we are tracking only one uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with two law firms with 2020 explorations of over 100,000 square feet for our availabilities at that time. The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to their renewals and we are not aware of any requirements with our net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contributes the pushing out decisions.","In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market either in the form of gut renovations and in some cases, ground-up developments such as Capital Crossing which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did six small deals this quarter, with starting rents in the mid-50s. Our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets have created a medium term sublet space in our portfolio.","While all the space is being used, these contractors are looking for cost saving opportunities and this space is their most marketable in their portfolios. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on these potential transactions which typically require additional sub-terms. We continue to see the Boston suburban market as having the strongest relative demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from a series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Waltham\/Lexington submarket has accelerated during the last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion.","Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we are negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It\u2019s been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, there are very strong demand drivers.","I will describe the active lease discussion on the first phase of our new development on the North Parcel. In addition to our development, MIT has approvals for an additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space and the RFP for the Volpe site has been issued and offers will be due in the coming weeks. The current zoning on the Volpe site for a nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 970,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 124,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building, had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017 allowing us the opportunity to release that space well before the original expiration date.","As lease today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that\u2019s nothing like what\u2019s going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiating at 111 Huntington Avenue on a floor we are going to get back in 2017 and we are negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 888 Boylston Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December and the anchor office tenant, which is 154,000 square feet, is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of \u201817. So, we don\u2019t anticipate our full run-rate until the very end of \u201817 on that development. The flagship Prudential redevelopment is fully leased. We anticipate Eli will be opening in the fourth quarter of \u201816 and the final retail tenants will be opened by mid 2017.","We are off to a great start in Los Angeles as Owen suggested. Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West LA market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers and it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the four weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with 160,000 square feet user and are in active discussion with another tenant for 60,000 square feet as well as discussions with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these two leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan.","Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With the additional leasing at Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017.","And with that, I will turn the floor over to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up and the debt markets have been open and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rates market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have two mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. One is the $350 million mortgage on Embarcadero Center floor. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1. And the second is the $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4% GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window and we can pay them off with no penalty commencing this September and refinance at significantly lower interest expense.","We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund in our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage is expected to improve as we achieve the significant earnings contributions projected from our development as we move into late 2017 and 2018.","Additionally, last week, Moody\u2019s announced the positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credit spreads have tightened. Even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets where comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we have entered into hedges for a notional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at the 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today\u2019s interest rates, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging costs into our interest expense on the first $550 million of financing. Although we are evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance.","Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you can see from her press release that we reported second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share, that is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor and are exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016, so it represents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition into the second quarter, but has no impact on our full year projection. The largest piece was related to 100,000 square foot space at 399 Park Avenue that had a natural lease expiration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier and this in conjunction with the other leases that Doug mentioned represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park.","The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the out-performance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, while expenses, primarily utilities and repair and maintenance expense, were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full year guidance.","Our same-property performance moderated this quarter, but it was still strong with our share of combined cash NOI of 4.7% and combined GAAP NOI of 0.7% from the same quarter last year. The most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue that expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 760 75th Avenue that Doug talked about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring Street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We are working on a proposal for the majority of this space, but there will likely be 12 months to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expect to continue to see growth from lease-up and roll-up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. Overall, the leasing activity we are seeing is in line with our expectations and we assume our share of same-property combined NOI in 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2015.","In our non same-property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon its addition, we are increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the non same-property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our non-cash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of free rent, but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income, which is part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our non-cash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million.","As you think about the change in our full year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance virtually all of the second quarter earnings fee. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance.","I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First and just a reminder, that in 2016, we have recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street the last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second as Doug described in a development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 888 Boylston Street and all of the pre-leasing at Salesforce Tower will not commence GAAP revenue until late in \u201817 and into \u201818. The space is leased and the revenue commitment is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018.","Also, we have captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth that we have been projecting and we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease up of other properties such as 760 75th Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St. James will likely hit by 2018.","That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that will be great. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Question, Owen or Doug, as you think about your stated strategy and one of the components is to being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunity, I take it sort of view Colorado Center as part of LA. but I am curious if you think about what\u2019s going on in UK, certainly what\u2019s going up in Canada, you go to Toronto and London in the past, the U.S. currency is certainly a lot more stronger today and one could argue that those are the opportune times to get into the market, so how should investors \u2013 how should we think about how you are thinking about it today and whether that could be something that\u2019s on the table?","Owen Thomas","Yes. So Michael the \u2013 we have as you know targeted a handful of markets for potential expansion of the company, one of those was LA. We obviously made a significant move on that piece of the strategy last quarter and also London has been on our list. And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development. So that hasn\u2019t changed. However, in the short-term and medium-term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don\u2019t know the impacts on trade policy, what that\u2019s going to do to GDP growth. We don\u2019t know the impacts on passporting for financial institutions, what impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there has already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as the dollar investor, but we also think pricing for assets should also change given these uncertainties that I described. So, we are still looking, we are still active, but we are conscious of these additional risks and would expect those to be reflected in pricing. And then lastly, we are not particularly active looking at Toronto.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, guys, Manny here. If we just think about the comments you made on Colorado Center with a good backlog of leasing that\u2019s going to come in. Is there going to be an outsized capital commitment needed to get those tenants into that project or is that going to come with sort of the second phase of re-planning the project overall?","Owen Thomas","Manny, I think we have made a commitment to our tenants and we have I think had these conversations with our partners that the buildings, common areas need to be refreshed in a more significant way than simply painting carpet and so we have hired a series of design professionals that are going through a programmatic view of all of that right now which we are going to do one way or the other regardless of the leasing. And I think that those commitments are being described to the tenants as they talk about coming to the property.","Michael Bilerman","And Doug, maybe one last one for me, if we think about leasing at 399 and GM, you mentioned smaller spaces at GM, was that sort of your plan all along or has there been a shift in the market or demand profile of tenants that\u2019s now making you sort of rethink strategy to get those spaces of lease?","Doug Linde","I don\u2019t think our strategy has changed significantly. I mean, I have talked about this before that if you go back, call it, 4 to 5 years and you look at the number of relocations that involve tenants that are paying over $125,000 a square foot, you can probably count them on one hand. And so the market naturally is one that is a smaller market meaning a floor at a max and generally less than that. And so having grown through the experience of 510 Madison Avenue plus the top of 250 West 55th Street, I think we have become pretty acute and adept at doing the right kind of pre-built suite in marketing those types of spaces to the appropriate kinds of tenants and we recognized that it\u2019s a velocity game and we have got to increase velocity. And the best way to increase velocity is to be much more attuned to doing smaller deals.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Mike, I appreciate the comments on 2017 as we are building out our models. You talked about moderating same-store NOI heading into the end of the year. Based on the leasing you guys have done, when do you see the inflection point for same-store to turn positive or kind of start growing again?","Mike LaBelle","Well, I think we expect it to be positive, right. I mean, it\u2019s we are saying it\u2019s going to be 2% to 4% in 2016. So, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s been higher than that in the first two quarters. So, it\u2019s just going to come down a little bit, because we have got some of the vacancies that we talked about. But as we have seen our leasing stats, for many quarters in a row, we are having a positive mark-to-market on everything that we do. And I do anticipate that our occupancy is going to turn the corner in 2017 as well as we filled some of the vacancies at 120 St. James in the Hancock and the Peru. So, I don\u2019t have a number to give you right now, but I would expect positive performance in 2017 on the same-store.","Jamie Feldman","Yes, I guess I am sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said positive, I meant accelerating. So, do you think \u201817 same-store is on track to be better than \u201816?","Mike LaBelle","Again, I don\u2019t want to tell you where it\u2019s going to be, to be honest with you, Jamie, I just think it\u2019s going to continue to be positive. There is a lot of space that we can fill that it\u2019s going to add to us over the next, I would say, 24 months. The question is the timing of when some of those spaces gets filled and when the revenue recognition associated with those spaces are and whether that is in \u201817 or pushing into \u201818. So, there is a little bit of a timing game but these are all really, really high-quality spaces and I think we are proving that we are getting all the rollups through the leasing that we are doing. So, I feel very optimistic and positive about our ability to continue to grow our same-store and achieve the NOI bridge that we have been talking about.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then as we think about AFFO for the year, how are you guys tracking now?","Doug Linde","So, on the FAD side, I would say that our guidance for 2016 is still somewhere in the low $4 range, I think $4 to $4.20 something like that per share. We did have a little bit of elevated transaction cost this quarter associated with some long-term leases that we did both in Washington and New York City. There were two in particular that were longer term and had some higher transaction costs associated with it that kind of hit our FAD a little bit this quarter, but we still expect to be generally where we were when we talked about this last quarter.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then any early thoughts on the train shutdown heading to Brooklyn and what it means for your project out there longer term for leasing?","Doug Linde","I will make a quick comment and then John Powers you can comment on this too. The good news for us is that we don\u2019t anticipate delivering our space until the second or third quarter of 2018. And from what we are told, the L train is going to be out of service for 18 months, which would line it backup for when in fact we deliver, but John, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts?","John Powers","Yes, the L train \u2013 it\u2019s unfortunate for the Brooklyn residents, but not unfortunate for our project, because that goes into Williamsburg and we are south of that. So, the lines that the subway takers would use to get to our project, Dock 72 will not be affected.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, alright, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just the follow-up for Mike on same-store NOI just looking at the trend, your cash same-store NOI guidance and your share 2% to 4%, if my math is right, it looks like you will have to average around 0% for the rest of the year to get to the midpoint. So, is it just that you are looking for significant same-store occupancy drag for the rest of the year or is there something with straight line rent, because it seems like rent spreads and rent ramps are pretty strong, so was there something else I am missing?","Mike LaBelle","Look, I think the biggest drivers are New York City where we have the two floors at the General Motors building coming back in July. We had the four floors at 601 Lexington Avenue that came back midway through the second quarter. And then we have this space in suburban Boston that I mentioned in my formal remarks that it\u2019s coming back. And so you are going to see some degradation in occupancy in the third quarter. And I think we make \u2013 hopefully, we will see some come back in the fourth quarter and late in the fourth quarter, but those are the things that are driving our share of the same-store being, I would say, 0% to 1% probably in the next couple of quarters.","Blaine Heck","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe for Doug or Ray Ritchey, it sounds like you guys are off to a great start with the leasing at Colorado Center, but can you talk a little bit about the amount of interest you are seeing in the balance of the vacant space and whether the peso leasing has surprised you guys or were any of the leases that anticipated kind of when you bought the asset?","Doug Linde","So when we started the diligence on the asset after we reached our agreement with Blackstone to purchase their interest, there were a few tenants that were \u201cshopping the property\u201d but had no real sense of who the ownership was going to be. And so I think there was a lack of concrete proposals. Ray has done a fabulous job of walking the walk and talking the talk and being out there. He is actually there right now, which is why he is not on this call and he has been very proactive about meeting every tenant that we have made a proposal to, which I think is a different approach than the current \u2013 the former ownership had with regards to leasing. And so I think we have turned the lot of heads in terms of the way we were managing this asset. And quite frankly, as I said before, these kinds of buildings and these kinds of clients match up with the way we run our platform. And so we are used to and anticipate doing these types of things when we buy a property or when we are developing a property. So, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say we are surprised by the level of activity. We are very encouraged by the receptivity that the activity has had to our approach and the way we are pricing the property and the way we are committed to enhancing the environment and the experience for our tenants and our customers, because that\u2019s what this is all about.","Blaine Heck","So, what\u2019s the kind of reasonable timeframe for expecting that asset to be leased up to a stabilized level?","Doug Linde","So the underwriting that Owen was describing assume that we weren\u2019t going to do any leasing for 18 months. Obviously, we are going to be doing a lot more leasing than that. And so, I would anticipate that we will get these first couple of leases done some time in 2016. Again, when the tenants actually occupy the space and revenue recognition occurs is a little bit out of our control, but we are hoping that we are going to be in the 90s by the middle of 2017, which is 12 months after we bought the property.","Blaine Heck","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO.","John Kim","Thank you. I think Owen you mentioned methodically building your presence in LA, but your balance sheet position allows you to acquire almost anything accretively and you have had some good leasing progress so far, so why not acquire more rapidly in the market?","Owen Thomas","Well, our approach is to create value and not to buy assets that are stabilized at low cap rates. So most of the investment that we have been making is \u2013 has been in ground up development as you know. I described three projects that we delivered this quarter at 7.8% cash yield for a brand new asset, again in our core markets which we think is very value creative. So we are looking at everything that\u2019s offered in West LA. We are looking at development opportunities are not as many, given the restrictions that are on development in West LA which is one of the attraction, honestly of the market. So we are looking at that. And I think would also certainly be much more interested in assets like Colorado Center that are very high quality, but they had something that needs to be done. So when we bought Colorado Center, it was 68% leased and there was an upside opportunity in our minds from leasing it up which I think as Doug described, we are very much on track in doing. So yes, we could go out and pay, purchase the pipeline of assets that continue to be offered in the marketplace, but we want to be selective about getting a high quality asset, giving an asset that is positioned for our type of tenants which are generally larger and also we would prefer an acquisition where there is something that we can do to add value as a property company.","John Kim","Okay. And Doug I think you mentioned that you have achieved $50 million of the $80 million organic growth forecasted through 2017, given that progress so far, is there an upside to this organic growth number?","Doug Linde","So, what we are talking about is the bridge. So, what we basically said was here are all the major holds in the portfolio in \u201816 and \u201817 and if we sell them all up, we will get to $80 million. So, I think the number is a consistent number and its $58 million, not $50 million.","John Kim","Okay. Can you provide some color on the Under Armour space, the remaining 17,000 square feet available, where is that located within the Former FAO Schwarz space. And if you could just comment generally on experience based retail and there are any other opportunities in your portfolio where you have leasing opportunities like this?","Doug Linde","Sure. John, do you want to take a crack at describing sort of the space and how the FAO space was configured and what\u2019s going to happen?","John Powers","Sure. The FAO spaces are on four different floors and we are re-leased, as Doug said, majority of the space. The balance of the space is not on the main floor and there are some different possibilities of how we can continue that and we have worked out that with Under Armour.","Doug Linde","And with regard to the experience of retail, I think it\u2019s a critically important component of what we are doing and Bryan, you might wanted to describe what we are doing at Prudential Center and our decision for example to bring Italy [ph] into that property and why we are doing that?","Bryan Koop","Yes. Several years ago, we came to a conclusion that in order to be relevant in terms of retail formats, which is so important to our mixed use projects, we had to have a large component of experience for retail. Our major decision was the decision to shutdown our traditional food court, which was a high performing food court, one of the highest grossing in North America and repositioning with Italy that will open up this November. We continue to see strong demand, not only in these mixed use high density projects but the urban markets are incredibly high in demand and we consistently see it whether it\u2019s a Prudential Center where we have very few spaces remaining in terms of our repositioning of the entire asset, but we are also seeing it in our limited amount of retail, we had in Cambridge and then also the significant amount we have pre-leased at our Hub project at North Station with our partners, with Jacobs, at Delaware North. And I think both those projects are indicative of that. You will also see it just in terms of the urban storefront in our downtown assets as well.","Doug Linde","And just to sort of keep going, so we are doing a similar project at 100 Federal Street where we are building basically a glass experiential box that we hope is the gathering place for the downtown market. And John, you may want to describe what we are doing at 601?","John Powers","Well, 601 is a very exciting redevelopment. Doug mentioned \u2013 or I think Owen mentioned initially, the smaller building which used to cover atrium building, we are re-branding that completely. We are taking skin off the building. We are taking all the mechanical systems. It will be essentially down to a slab and steel structure and rebuilding it from scratch up. So that\u2019s going to be very well received in the market. That\u2019s almost 200,000 square feet. We are also looking at that the atrium and have plans to make that into a spectacular food hall and that will be just a little later and it\u2019s timing relative to the office building.","John Kim","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Yes. Hi guys, sorry about that. Just a question on the development side of things and some of the commentary around protecting the downside, pre-leasing has been a part of the strategy for a while but I was just curious if the continued sort of slowness in the economy has raised the bar in terms of what you would require from a pre-leasing perspective relative to maybe a year ago or so, I just also \u2013 just a question on just leasing activity you are seeing at Dock 72?","Owen Thomas","So to answer your question and I have talked about this over the last couple of calls. Yes, I think given the slowness in the economy, we have raised the bar, so to speak in the level of pre-leasing that we require on new development. It\u2019s everyone always asks for a number of this and that\u2019s not possible to provide, because it depends on the size of the building, the activity level in the market, the speed of delivery, every circumstance is different, where is the tenant coming from, our existing portfolio from outside. But there is no question \u2013 as we evaluate new developments and we have a lot to evaluate even in our company because of the large land holdings that we have, pre-leasing is an absolute requirement and our desire to have it be larger in the portfolio is there. So that is definitely happening. However, I think we still see projects and I have described a couple of them, particularly several of the projects that we are looking at right now are actually 100% pre-leased. And those are the kinds of projects that we want to be doing and will create value for shareholders even if we are layer in the economic cycle. As it relates to Dock 72 leasing, we are just too far away from delivery to expect much significant pre-letting. We are clearly in the market speaking with potential tenants marketing the asset, but I think it\u2019s too early to expect \u2013 for us to expect to have significant pre-letting.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And just with regard to WeWork, I guess they have been in the news lately not necessarily for great reasons, but I am just curious, I mean there is no \u2013 I guess there are no discussions with them potentially re-trading that or\u2026?","Doug Linde","No, we are full systems go with WeWork at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and at the other two properties where we have leases. Let me comment that as we have, in our discussions with WeWork, all evidence that we have points to the fact that the facilities that they have opened are very successful. They are fully let and they are creating attractive margin to WeWork. And we are seeing it in the projects where they are opened with us, particularly 535 Mission has been very successful. So a lot of the press that you are describing is more about WeWork as a company. And again from reading the same press, a reduction in the projections that they are projecting for their overall company, but as it relates to the performance of the individual installations we are evidence I think suggest that they are doing well.","John Powers","And this is John, if I could just like to add one comment. We are very actively engaged with them at the Navy Yard. We are driving piles it was Owen said it\u2019s early on. It will be more exciting in the fall when this deal goes up, but we are in weekly communications with WeWork. They have submitted their build out plans. We are adjusting the build out plans. We are co-working with them on the amenity space. They are very, very excited about the project.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Management.","Craig Mailman","So, follow-up on FAO space, I think Doug, you said that the lease with Under Armour represents what you guys thought it was $80 million? I am just curious when you guys kind of underwrote the backfill the FAO space, does Under Armour just by itself represent the backfill, then the 17,000, it includes pro forma, the balance will lease up?","Doug Linde","I think the answer is yes to both. So, I am not being sort of tongue and cheek about it. We are comfortable with the rent that we pro forma for Under Armour and based upon what\u2019s available we think we will do a little bit better.","Craig Mailman","Okay. And then I thought that space was 60,000 square feet, it looks like it\u2019s closer to 70,000, was FAO just not leasing all the leasable space you guys creating the low rate space?","Doug Linde","No, there was 68,000 square feet of space. Some of it might have been as John suggested it was on four levels. So, there was second floor space. There were sort of two-storey, two-storeys of first floor space, because that\u2019s the level on Madison Avenue and the level on Fifth Avenue are on slightly different planes and then there was some sub-grade space or concord space and sub-concord space. So, there is a plethora of levels there and it was about 58,000 square feet.","John Powers","And those levels can connect differently. We could put the second floor level connected to the Madison. We can take part of the sub-concourse and put it with the bank. If the bank doesn\u2019t stay that\u2019s on Madison, because it\u2019s fairly complicated, but we have worked it out, I think with Under Armour. They are committed to block a space of square footage that Doug mentioned.","Craig Mailman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just switching to the debt side of things, Mike, your comments were helpful. I am just curious, it sounds like you guys don\u2019t necessarily think rates are going higher that quickly here. As you look to fund the remaining development spend, are you more apt to put construction facilities in place or kind of hit the unsecured market and sit on the cash?","Mike LaBelle","No, I think that we will do some construction financing on some of the joint venture development projects that we have. So, we are in the market for both the Brooklyn Navy Yard and for the Hub on Causeway. So, we will be leasing construction financings on those projects. For the remaining cost for the wholly owned developments, I would expect that we would use cash on hand. And then at some point, we would do some long-term financing rates that we feel are very, very attractive to kind of lock in and make sure that we lock in as low rate as we can. So, we will be evaluating that.","John Powers","And just as a surrogate, right? So, a construction loan space probably LIBOR plus 200 at the lowest level and 300 and you can do a 10-year financing at 3%. So, the value of a construction loan from a rate perspective is de minimis.","Doug Linde","That\u2019s an excellent point.","Craig Mailman","Thank you.","Doug Linde","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","On the Oakland department development, there have been some concerns about softening conditions in the Bay Area residential marketing. Just curious how you are thinking about the risk from slowing job growth in new supply in the metro area there as you move forward on the project?","Doug Linde","Sure. Bob, you want to take that one?","Bob Pester","Sure. First off, we are underwriting at rents that are approximately 25% to 30% less than San Francisco. It\u2019s going to take several years to get it entitled and we don\u2019t anticipate delivering that building until probably 2019, 2020. So, we are quite ways off based on current market conditions from a standpoint as the market is softening right now which we are seeing in San Francisco.","Doug Linde","And Bob, you might just want to describe sort of the Temescal area and the Rockridge area and sort of what that is, because it\u2019s not downtown Oakland?","Bob Pester","It\u2019s \u2013 this site is right adjacent to the MacArthur BART station. This is an area that has become very popular for restaurant shops. It\u2019s one of for lack of a better term, one of the hipper neighborhoods in the Oakland Berkeley market and it\u2019s one that is gentrifying quite rapidly. So, we see it as a very good location long-term.","Jed Reagan","Okay, that\u2019s hopeful. And just sticking on the Bay Area, on Salesforce Tower, you had mentioned earlier this year that you thought you might get 5 to 15 new floors on this year. I think it was based on what you have done so far this year, how much additional space do you think you could get committed by the end of this year and then maybe by this time next year?","Doug Linde","So, look the deals that we have in the works right now add up to about 8 floors? So, if we are able to do half of them, we probably will get 5 or 6 of those floors done. And I think that our expectation is that we are going to continue to go with that type of a pace so that as we get closer to people actually being able to go into the building and go to their floor and to sort of experience the spectacular configuration views, curtain wall, airflow, ceiling height that, that will ramp up the activity and we anticipate that will be happening towards the end of this calendar year where we have to actually do those tours on finished floors. And so, I will let Bob be the spokesperson, because he has already made a commitment for the company, but we continue to be very encouraged by the leasing there. Bob?","Bob Pester","I think Donald Trump would refer to the building as something really, really special. It\u2019s the A1 location in San Francisco. It\u2019s going to be the biggest and the best building that\u2019s in the marketplace and I am very confident that it\u2019s going to lease up rapidly.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thank you. And then just last one for me. Can you talk about the tempo of leasing demand you are seeing across your portfolio between larger tenants versus smaller tenants? Would you say it\u2019s fair to say that larger tenants are more cautious today?","Doug Linde","I think that larger tenants are not necessarily more cautious. I think the larger tenants are fully committed to lease exploration driven decisions that allow them to build out space. So, anybody who is looking for hundreds of thousands of square feet of space is doing that, because across the broad markets that we are in, because they have a lease expiration and I don\u2019t think anyone is looking at the market and saying, well, we think things are going to get worse and therefore we are going to hold off. I think there people feel relatively good about sort of the position that the markets are in. On the smaller side where there is a lot more flexibility, I think the volatility that Owen described and issues associated with the world at large are creating uncertainty and uncertainty just doesn\u2019t drive significant capital decisions and so we are seeing a lot more reticence to making decisions on new space for smaller companies.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke","Hey, good morning guys. Just a question on the guidance, what you have done so far for the year and then the midpoint of guidance for the third quarter of 141, it looks like it would imply about 149 for the fourth quarter, so just wanted to understand anything we are going to be thinking about that would drive that sequential improvement from Q3, Q4?","Owen Thomas","I think there is really three things that we have. One is developments that are occurring and leasing up, which is part of that. We will have a couple of tenants at 888 that will take occupancy later this year that have a benefit to the company. Also interest expense, we talked about the fact that we don\u2019t have any early refinancing in our guidance, but we do have the Embarcadero Center and it\u2019s a 7% loan. So, there is an assumption on our guidance. So, there is going to be much lower interest expense when we refinance that in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to utilities, where the HVAC is obviously a little more expensive in the harder times of the year that we are sitting in right now, actually. So, those are kind of the most of the drivers and there is some positives that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we are guiding later in the year things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center where we have got renewals that we are working on that we are trying to sign that we have kind of a blend and extend where we will get some GAAP lift later in the year. So it\u2019s those kinds of thing.","Brad Burke","Okay. And then also related to guidance, of the $58 million of the $80 million NOI bridge, just wondering how much of that is already being recognized as GAAP NOI and to the extent that you are not recognizing any of it yet when you would expect that to roll on in your numbers?","Owen Thomas","We have provided some information as to the timing of that. I can\u2019t give you exact numbers. I would say that somewhere between $15 million and $20 million is in today, because that was if you look at our slide, there was 535 Mission and existing rent lease up within in that and that is done. A good chunk of, I would say, half of the Embarcadero Center stuff will be in late this year and next year. And then the Prudential Center stuff would be in next year, but not this year. And then there are some big pieces that I think will be later. We are going to get some of the lease up at 200 Clarendon Street and perhaps a floor at 120 St. James that will hit sometime in \u201817, the majority of that I see has been later because that is \u2013 most of that space is we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space. And then we have talked about Under Armour and the timing of that. And then, 100 Federal Street which is another big piece of it, the lease is fully signed. But right now we are relocating another tenant to create the floors. We are not going to be able to deliver those floors until sometime in the middle of \u201817. So some of that will be into \u201817 and then into \u201818. So I didn\u2019t give you the numbers, but that\u2019s hopefully helpful with some guidance on the timing.","Brad Burke","Got it, that is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will be brief since we are going late in the call here. But quickly on Boston, we have seen pretty strong job growth here over the last quarter especially relative to some of your other markets and I think you mentioned in your earlier remarks about the strength of pharma and biotech right now, but I am just wondering are you seeing that wholesale across the entire region or are you seeing any sort of bifurcation between suburban and infill?","Doug Linde","So most as of the technology oriented companies in the biotech and the pharma and life sciences companies are concentrated in the Cambridge market and then in the suburban markets, so there has been some migration into the city. So I would tell you that on a sort of ranking, Cambridge is the strongest market, the Waltham, Lexington market is the second strongest and then the CBD downtown markets are below that. And I think what our view is that the markets are very strong at the sort of lower level of buildings, but that there is a little less activity at the top of building and largely that\u2019s because the tenants that are driving demand. The top of the buildings traditionally are professional services and financial services companies and there is just less growth there.","John Powers","We have seen it and then really a beautiful stat, the P2 corridor as we call it between the Mass Turnpike and Route 2 at Lexington sites of the north along Interstate 95, the competitive set of buildings that we follow, 32 buildings are now at 4.25% vacancy, it\u2019s lowest I have seen in my career there. And I think it\u2019s indicative of your question, which was you have good strong demand from pharma, biotech sector that\u2019s looking and as Doug mentioned, solid company is not particularly huge companies, but companies that have growth in financial statements, so we were encouraged about that corridor in particular.","Tom Lesnick","Appreciate that insight. And then Bob, maybe one for you, there has been some recent news reports of Facebook pursuing a significant office expansion in the San Francisco proper, are you able to comment at all on what kind of chatter you are hearing among the brokerage community and if at all, it has this changed leasing dynamics, particularly in Central SoMa?","Owen Thomas","Yes. It\u2019s very preliminary as far as them looking into market. It\u2019s been rumored that they are interested in the Central SoMa area. The Central SoMa plan is not approved and won\u2019t be approved probably until the end of this year or early next year. So I think as far as them expanding in San Francisco unless they get an existing building is going to be quite sometime off.","Tom Lesnick","Great. I appreciate that. That\u2019s all we got. Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Okay, great. Hey, I am not sure this is for, but it looks like your earnings per share is over $3 this year, it looks like it\u2019s going to increase fairly rapidly next year, you have got a dividend of 2.60, sub-2%, it looks like you will have some gains on sales, you may or may not be able to 1031 exchange that into Colorado Center, but the long and the short of it is your sub-2% dividend may be holding back your stock price, you may have some taxable income issues, can you talk about both the regular dividend and the special dividend?","Doug Linde","Yes. Good morning, John. So on the special dividend, as you know, that\u2019s driven by asset sales. I described three deals that we are working on. There are a couple of other little smaller things. And I said in my remarks that sales could be as high as $350 million. I would assume that\u2019s the highest they would be. All those deals may not happen. We don\u2019t know where they are priced. The original direction on asset sales was to 2 to 2.50. So we don\u2019t know yet exactly what the asset sales are going to be. So it\u2019s difficult for us to predict what the gains and so forth are going to be associated with that. So we are clearly \u2013 look at that and working with our Board later in the year to determine what if any special dividend, we would pay. And then as it relates to the recurring dividend, as you know, we mirror that to net income and as you pointed out, net income will be rising. So again, with our Board as we get into later this year, we will be evaluating the ongoing dividend to determine whether and how much we could increase it.","John Guinee","Any idea Mike, what\u2019s your \u2013 and if your earnings per share is $3 or more, what your taxable income is for 2016?","Mike LaBelle","I don\u2019t have a number for you here. And I think that I can say that our taxable income is fairly close in line with where dividend is.","John Guinee","Great, okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.","Owen Thomas","John, thank you. I think that concludes our questions and concludes our formal remarks. Thank you for your time and attention and interest in Boston Properties.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day."],"3538":["Boston Properties, Inc.

This call is being recorded [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties third quarter earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night as well as furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bostonproperties.com. An audio webcast of this call will be available for 12 months in the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.","Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in Wednesday's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Having said that, I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista, and good morning. First, I'd like to thank everyone who attended or listened to our Investor Conference in early October. Given that we just completed a thorough review of our portfolio and markets, we're going to focus our remarks this morning on the quarterly results, 2018 guidance and anything else that's new since the conference.","On current results, our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 above our prior forecast and $0.03 above Street consensus. We also, as a result, increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.02. We leased 2.6 million square feet in the third quarter, which is significantly above our long-term quarterly average for the period. Year-to-date, we've leased 4.1 million square feet, and are on track for above-average leasing for 2017.","Our in-service office portfolio occupancy declined by about 60 basis points to 90.2% from the end of the second quarter, primarily due to the previously-discussed occupancy reduction at 399 Park Avenue. Rent roll-ups in the aggregate for the third quarter on commenced leases were up modestly on a net and gross basis. In the quarter, we also commenced 1.4 million square feet in two new developments that are 100% leased and delivered a 417,000-square foot project. Lastly, we've had a very active and successful year financing our business. Year-to-date, we've raised $5.1 billion in financings and increased our weighted average debt maturity from 4.7 to 6.1 years.","Now moving to the macro environment. Economic growth has improved marginally to 3.1% for the second quarter, and advanced estimates for the third quarter are 3%. And though recent hurricanes have had a negative impact on the September job data, unemployment did decline to 4.2%. Consistent with my Investor Conference commentary, tepid but steady economic growth continues, and we're not making any investment or operational decisions based on improvements that might result from current tax reform efforts.","Moving to the financial markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has had a substantial upward move, rising nearly 35 basis points since early September. Demand for credit also remains robust with tight credit spreads in most sectors. Though we would expect another round of Fed tightening in December and a measured unwind of quantitative easing, inflation remains low at 2.2%, and interest rates are higher in the U.S. than the rest of the developed world. Though we believe interest rates could rise further, we expect to continue to operate in a relatively low and constructive interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.","The five major office markets where we operate are, taken as a whole, in general equilibrium. Economic growth continues to create jobs and net absorption of office space, which is currently in balance with new development or additions to supply. Specifically, for our five markets, net absorption for the third quarter was 1.2 million square feet or 0.2% of total occupied space, while deliveries were 1.7 million square feet or 0.2% of total stock. Vacancy remained flat at 8.3%, while rents grew 0.2% for the quarter. Leasing activity remains healthy, with the strongest activity continuing to be in the technology and life science segments. And as a result, San Francisco and Boston are outperforming New York and Washington, D.C. among our markets.","Though significant liquidity and a healthy bid still exists for high-quality, well-leased office assets in our core portfolio, office sale transaction volume's down 27% through the end of the third quarter in the United States. I think there are two primary reasons for this decline. First, there are fewer high-quality assets in the market, given more of these assets are now owned by long-term institutional holders. Second, the market has become more exacting regarding asset quality and is requiring higher returns for less well -- located in the less well-leased assets. Notwithstanding the slowdown, once again, this past quarter, several significant office transactions were completed at attractive valuations in our market.","In New York, a Japanese property company purchased a 90% interest in 50 Hudson Yards, which is a 2.8 million-square foot Class A office building currently under construction. The price was $3.9 billion or over $1,400 a square foot. The cap rate is not meaningful given the property is currently 30% pre-leased.","In Santa Monica, one block away from Colorado Center, Arboretum Courtyard, which is a 147,000-square foot office building, sold for $152 million to a domestic manager. Pricing was $1,030 a square foot and a 4% cap rate. In two separate transactions to the same buyer, 9401 and 9665 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills are being sold to a domestic REIT partnered with OffShore Capital. Together, the buildings represent over 300,000 square feet, are being sold for $334 million. And pricing is $1,075 a square foot and under a 4% initial cap rate.","And lastly, in San Francisco, the developer of 222 2nd Street recapitalized the building for an aggregate value of $530 million or $1,171 a square foot and a 4% cap rate. The asset is a newly-constructed 450,000-square foot office building located in the SOMA District and fully leased to LinkedIn. Our capital strategy posture remains unchanged. We are cautiously constructive on the environment and investing in pre-leased developments and redevelopments that make sense. We do not need to raise equity capital, and are selectively selling non-core assets to continuously upgrade our portfolio. Though we do not anticipate a near-term downturn in the market, we are hedged for such an occurrence, given our low leverage and increasing FFO from developments, both of which should provide us access to capital for the resultant opportunity set.","Now moving to our capital activities. In the third quarter, we sold a land parcel in Reston to a major corporate user for its headquarters for $14 million, and we currently have a small number of noncore assets in the market in Washington, D.C. and suburban Boston. Our estimate for total dispositions for 2017 is just under $200 million.","Our development activity remains very active. This past quarter, we placed fully in service 888 Boylston Street at the Prudential Center, again which is a 417,000-square foot office and retail building that is 93% leased. We also added to our development pipeline 7750 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, which will become Marriott's 740,000 square foot new world headquarters and 6595 Springfield Center Drive, which is a 637,000 square foot development in Springfield, Virginia fully leased to the TSA. These two deals alone represent $525 million in new investment for us with attractive yield characteristics and no leasing risk.","In the predevelopment pipeline, we are close to an anchor lease commitment for 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and are competing for major corporate users to launch projects at 20 CityPoint in Waltham, 1001 6th Street in Washington, D.C. as well as several major build-to-suit opportunities in and around Reston Town Center. While there is uncertainty whether these tenant prospects can be secured, if we are successful, these projects aggregate 2.5 million square feet of new development; are 100% owned, except for 1001 6th Street; provide initial cash returns consistent with our office development targets; and will be a primary engine for additional company growth beyond 2020.","In the third quarter, our development pipeline grew modestly and now consists of nine new projects and two redevelopments, totaling 5.7 million square feet and $3.1 billion in our share of projected costs, of which we have funded $1.7 billion through the end of the third quarter. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments remains approximately 7%. And the pre-leasing component of the -- the pre-leasing of the commercial component increased 9% in the quarter to 75%.","So to conclude, we continue to be confident about our prospects for growth and ability to create shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We continue to make good progress on our clearly-communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And growth beyond 2020 is now becoming more clear and likely, given the new developments we've added to our pipeline and our progress on predevelopment.","Now let me turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I've truncated my comments this morning since we provided you with a pretty robust view of the portfolio at the conference less than 30 days ago. Let me start with the mark-to-market comparisons because that's something that everyone sort of latches on to, and that's on Page 42 of our supplemental.","So our second-generation leasing statistics. We're really pretty much in sync with all those rollover charts that we provided and are part of our investor package, all available on the website. In Boston, there was about 300,000 square feet of space that we hit the second-generation stat this quarter. The majority of it was in Waltham, our suburban assets, and we were up about 12% on a net basis. In San Francisco, it was a smaller portfolio. It's about 144,000 square feet, and it was heavily weighted to Embarcadero Center, and we were up 24%.","In New York City, it included about 191,000 square feet. And remember, I explicitly talked about a roll-down that we were going to see during the quarter on about 38,000 square feet, one of the low-rise floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, and I mentioned that we were moving from $160 to $115. Now that's obviously with no -- very little transaction costs, low TIs, no downtime. And yet we were still only down 4% in New York City with that big rollover, which was down almost 50% on a net basis.","And then in D.C., the pool was about 386,000 square feet. And it was dominated by a 15 year, 190,000 square foot renewal with the GSA at 500 East Street, again, very low transaction costs, only $7 of TIs, and that D.C. pool was down about 10%.","So let me start with my regional comments. At Salesforce Tower, we received our temporary certificate of occupancy, which is a great milestone. And during 2017, we've now completed 350,000 square feet of leasing. So we are at 1.23 million square feet done on that 1.412 million-square foot building. We have lease negotiations out on 152,000 square feet of the remaining 177,000 square feet. That would bring us to 98% leased. And unfortunately, that means Mr. Pester will not meet his goal of being 100% leased by the end of the year. Every lease we've signed or negotiating is scheduled to commence by the third quarter of 2019. So pretty much in sync with those numbers that we showed you again at the conference in terms of the timing of our deliveries.","Turning to the other new construction in the CBD of San Francisco. 181 Fremont is now 100% leased. You heard The Exchange is now 100% leased, and there are leases in progress for 100% of 350 Bush. So that means that Park Tower's 750,000 square foot building, which is likely to be available in late 2018, is it. That is the only new product until 1st and Mission delivers in 2021 and beyond that is under construction in San Francisco.","Large blocks of contiguous direct available space are basically absent from the market. This quarter, our 56,000 square foot tenant at 50 Hawthorne announced they were closing their San Francisco office, which is leased at $65 gross. They are negotiating, and as-is sublet for the entire space for basically the entire remaining term, starting rents mid 80s. We will share in the sublet profits.","Sublet space inventory is very low, though it's expected that Dropbox will put a large block on the market as part of their transaction. So I guess if you're looking for the less robust view in San Francisco, you'd have to point to the limited growth and activity from the nontraditional technology office users. Yet, we have two law firms at Embarcadero Center that are expanding. And all the remaining leasing at Salesforce Tower is with traditional tenants, and three of those deals at 152,000 square feet are adding space as part of their requirement.","In Boston, we completed another 167,000 square foot of leasing at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon during the quarter and another 60,000 square feet this week. We hope to complete our lease negotiations at The Hub on Causeway for 140,000 square feet of the 180,000 square feet of podium space this month. And we reached agreements with retail users for 36,000 square feet of the retail space. That gets us to 95% leased on all the retail space at The Hub.","While there are not a lot of large exploration-driven requirements in the Boston CBD, we have seen some inbound activity and some tech growth continue. During the third quarter, two tenants made commitments to move into the city, one from Needham and the other from Lexington. Both tenants have leases in Boston Properties assets, one for 80,000 square feet that goes through December 31 of '19, and the other for 320,000 square feet that goes through November 30 of 2022. There continue to be a handful of modest-sized tenants that are expanding and exploring new space alternatives in the CBD, and that includes the tenants that we are talking to at The Hub on Causeway.","In our Waltham suburban portfolio, our largest lease this quarter involved recapturing and then re-leasing 40,000 square feet at our Reservoir Place asset as well as a 125,000-square foot extension. One of the new build-to-suit proposals at our CityPoint land, as Owen suggested, appears to be moving forward. And if we're able to sign a lease for between 50% and 60% of the space in that building, we will start construction in early '18 and deliver for occupancy in the third quarter of '19. This is about a 200,000-square foot project.","As we said at the Investor Conference, the most significant opportunity for high contribution occupancy improvements in the portfolio is in New York City. We completed our space trade at the base of 399 Park, leaving us with a 192,000 square foot block on floors seven, eight and nine. And with the addition of a 10th floor 60,000 square feet that's expiring in 2018, we have a very attractively-priced 250,000-square foot block on Park Avenue at the base of the building.","In addition, we completed a lease for the entire 14th floor, 40,000 square feet, and we are in active discussions with multiple tenants all currently in the Midtown for between 65,000 and 250,000 square feet of that low-rise space as well as some 1- and 2-floor requirements for the tower space, where we have 190,000 square feet available.","Given the condition of the space and the build out, future executed leases for the space won't run through our income in 2018 and are not part of our 2018 projections, as Michael described. I also mentioned the early lease extensions we were working on in New York City during the conference. Well, we did one of them this week. We completed a long-term renewal with Ann Taylor at Times Square Tower for their 2020 expiration. While there's been lots of leasing on the far West Side, Midtown continues to support major lease commitments.","Since the beginning of this year, we've seen 19 deals, over 95,000 square feet each, and nine of those have been new leases, not renewals. If you define the high end of the market as over $100 a square foot, there's been a tremendous amount of activity completed this quarter, as a lot of products on the far west side got leases done. Three leases by themselves totaled over 465,000 square feet. But if you push the pricing thresholds to deals with starting rents at over $135 a square foot, the activity continue to involve much smaller users, 15,000 square feet and under, and there is more high-end space competing for those tenants.","Our activities in Washington, D.C. follows three themes. The first is that our franchise has been able to match sites and tenants together to spur an unprecedented series of build-to-suits. Owen said we completed the Marriott and TSA this quarter, and we're working to complete a deal at 2100 Penn. We're in active dialogue at 17Fifty in Reston. We have a large consolidation requirement we're talking to about Reston Phase 3, and we are chasing an anchor tenant for our site at 1001 6th Street, a tremendous amount of activity. All construction would commence upon signing leases.","The second theme is the strength in our Reston Town Center market as a real magnet for private-sector contractors and tech tenants. This quarter, we completed 7 transactions for 71,000 square feet of leasing. And we are working on 200,000 square feet, one of which, 135,000 square feet, signed 2 days ago.","The third is the highly-competitive leasing market for existing D.C. assets, including the multitude of repositioned B buildings. The good news is that we don't have a lot of this space. The challenge is that there are lots and lots and lots of options for smaller tenants. So summing things up. As of today, we've completed leases that we expect will add $81 million to our goal of $155 million -- that includes the re-leasing of 399 Park -- for net growth towards our $111 million of annualized in-service NOI, our \"revenue bridge. This is up about $12 million versus last quarter.","And finally, we added 200 basis points to our development component of our bridge. We're at 73%, where we anticipate the 2020 annualized incremental NOI of $242 million. Now I just want to point out that, that portfolio does not include any of the new leasing that Owen described at TSA or Marriott, and it doesn't include any of the new developments that we will commence on a going-forward basis. So we're trying to keep that pool tight together and describe the $242 million and the percentage of that that's been committed.","I'm going to stop here, and I'll let Mike review the quarter, and then provide the assumptions behind our 2018 estimates.","Mike LaBelle","Great, thanks, Doug. Good morning. I don't mean to pile onto what Owen says, but I do want to thank everybody for attending our Investor Conference last month. We had great attendance, both in person and via our webcast, and we truly appreciate your interest in BXP. You got to hear from over 30 individuals across all disciplines talk about their projects and their initiatives, and I think it really demonstrates the strong depth and talent that we have in our company.","This quarter, on the capital-raising front, we closed two new financings. The first is a $550 million, 10-year mortgage on Colorado Center. The loan bears interest at 3.56% fixed for 10 years, which is very attractive. We also closed a $205 million construction loan on our Hub on Causeway joint venture development. It's priced at LIBOR plus 2.25%, and it will fund all of the remaining development costs for this first phase of the project.","Turning to our earnings. Our third quarter funds from operations came in at $1.57 per share. That is about $6.5 million or $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range from last quarter. Our portfolio generated about $0.01 per share of our outperformance, half from higher rental revenues and the rest from operating expense savings. We recorded $3 million of higher-than-projected development and service fee income, most of which was related to the completion of our services at one of our third-party development projects. We anticipated this income in our full-year guidance, but did not project it to be accelerated into the third quarter.","And lastly, we experienced lower-than-expected G&A by about $0.01 per share related to lower health care and professional services costs. We don't expect this to recur. And next quarter, we should return closer to our second quarter run rate for G&A.","Our same-property NOI growth in the third quarter from the same period last year was up 3.4%, 2.7% on a cash basis, which was slightly ahead of projection. As we've been forecasting all year, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate our same-property NOI growth to turn negative due to the loss of a full quarter of 325,000 square feet of occupancy at 399 Park Avenue. We are raising our fourth quarter funds from operations projections due to improvement in our portfolio assumptions as well as incorporating additional development services income, primarily related to the commencement of the development of the Marriott joint venture project. Overall, we're increasing our guidance range for 2017 full year diluted funds from operation by $0.02 per share at the midpoint to $6.24 to $6.25 per share. At $6.25 per share, our 2017 growth in FFO will be 3.6% over 2016. This performance is in spite of losing $0.20 per share of termination income and $0.10 per share in the second half of 2017 from 399 Park Avenue.","In 2018, we expect a full year of downtime at the building, and we'll have to overcome $0.18 per share of lost FFO. So please keep this in mind as I describe our assumptions behind our 2018 estimates. The income -- the impact of 399 shows up in our same-property portfolio NOI growth. As Doug mentioned, given the fact that we expect this space to be fully rebuilt by new tenants, there will be no revenue on the vacant space in 2018 even after it's leased. This space alone represents a 200 basis point drop on our same-property NOI growth from year-to-year.","The remainder of the New York City portfolio is expected to continue to demonstrate growth in NOI, but it will not be sufficient to overcome the loss of income at 399 Park. We do have growth in other parts of the portfolio. And overall, while we expect occupancy at the start of the year to be a low point, approximately 90%, we expect we will build our occupancy and end 2018 with occupancy above 92%. On average, we expect occupancy to be between 90% and 92% for the year. In Boston, we anticipate 200 basis points of occupancy improvement, including completing the lease-up of 200 Clarendon Street and a good portion of our vacancy at the Prudential Center. We will also experience improvement at 100 Federal Street, as Putnam moved into the majority of their new space in 2017.","In total, we project our Boston portfolio same-property NOI to be higher in 2018 by between 5% and 7%. We project improvement year-over-year in San Francisco, where we've been achieving strong roll-up in rents on our leasing activity. We project growth in 2018 of between 2% and 3%. Now this assumes we do not achieve any revenue from 80,000 square feet of space that will be vacated at Embarcadero Center when Bain moves to their new premises at Salesforce Tower in early 2018.","On a cash basis, our San Francisco NOI growth is projected to be in excess of 6% from the cash impact of all the early renewal activity -- these were 2018 expirations -- that we completed over the past couple of years that has already been blended into our GAAP earnings. In Washington, D.C., our CBD portfolio is stable, and we have minimal rollover exposure there next year. In Reston, where we're currently 97% leased in our 3.6 million-square foot town center properties, we have 200,000 square feet of known move-outs at lease expiration, where we expect vacancy in 2018. We have expanding tenants within the center who will likely take up a portion of the space, but we'll have some downtime that will impact our NOI growth from the portfolio. Overall, we project that growth in 2018 NOI from our same-property portfolio will be higher by between 0.5% and 2.5% on both a GAAP and a cash basis from 2017.","Now our projections for cash NOI same-property growth would actually be 100 basis points higher if not for two early renewals we have in New York City. Doug described the first, which was signed this week, and the other is still in negotiation. But both of these deals include offering free rent in 2018 in exchange for long term extensions. They're both good for the portfolio long term. They're NPV positive, as they avoid downtime and mark rents up to market, but they do result in lower cash NOI in 2018.","Our same-property assumptions have always excluded the impact of termination income. In 2017, we project termination income to be approximately $24 million. The majority of this comes from two floors at 767 Fifth Avenue and two floors at 399 Park Avenue, both that occurred earlier this year. Our current assumption for termination income in 2018 is between $4 million and $8 million. So we expect to lose approximately $18 million year-to-year.","We project strong contribution in 2018 from our non-same-property portfolio. That's comprised primarily of our development deliveries. The incremental contribution from these properties in 2018 is projected to be between $40 million and $50 million.","The biggest contributors to this growth are 888 Boylston Street, where we will have a full year of stabilized income, plus the impact of the initial tenants commencing occupancy at Salesforce Tower. It also includes the elimination of approximately $7 million for our share of demolition expenses that we booked this year, but do not anticipate recurring in 2018.","We project our income from development and management services to decline modestly in 2018. We project a range of $29 million to $34 million. The reduction is primarily related to our adoption of the new revenue recognition rules from FASB. The modified rules have a negative impact of about $3 million on our 2018 income versus the old accounting method. So, in other words, we're simply losing $3 million of revenue.","The last item I would like to cover is interest expense. As we discussed over the last couple of quarters, the refinancing of our loan on the GM Building has a meaningful impact on our interest expense. The accounting for the prior loan included a fair value adjustment that reduced our reported interest expense to 50% of what we actually paid.","In addition, we project an increase in our debt next year of approximately $550 million to fund our growing development pipeline. We project funding this from our unsecured term loan facility and our corporate revolver, both of which are currently untapped and have aggregate availability of $2 billion. We anticipate our 2018 capitalized interest to be roughly equivalent to this year, as additional capitalized interest from our new developments is offset by development deliveries of 888 Boylston Street this year and Salesforce Tower and our two residential projects next year.","So overall, we project our net interest expense to be between $375 million and $390 million in 2018. This represents an increase of $25 million at the midpoint from our 2017 midpoint. $15 million of this increase is from the change in noncash interest related to the GM Building refinancing. We also project our share of interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures to be higher by $5 million, reflecting a full year of interest expense from the financing of Colorado Center.","So in summary, if you use $6.25 per share for 2017 as a starting point, at the midpoint of our 2018 assumptions, we project an increase of $0.13 per share from the same-property portfolio, $0.26 per share from development deliveries. This is partially offset by $0.10 per share of lower termination income and $0.17 per share of higher interest expense. We project slightly lower fee income, higher non-controlling interest and higher G&A that reduces our projection by $0.09 per share. This results in a midpoint for 2018 projected funds from operations of $6.28 per share and our new guidance range of $6.20 to $6.36 per share.","In summary, and most importantly, our portfolio continues to generate growth, and we are projecting strong external growth from our developments. Our projected year-over-year FFO growth would be much stronger if not for the impact of termination income that accelerated 2018 revenue into 2017 and the loss of the noncash fair value interest benefit we've been receiving on our prior loan at the GM Building.","Net of termination income, we project our portfolio revenues to increase by approximately 5.7% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our projections do not include the impact of any acquisitions or dispositions. We currently have two operating properties on the market for disposition. The NOI contribution from these two properties is approximately $0.05 per share. As we expressed during our Investor Conference, we expect stronger growth in the portfolio in 2019 as we lease our vacant and expiring space at 399 Park Avenue and NOI from the rest of the portfolio continues to grow. We also project a substantial increase in the contribution from our development deliveries in 2019 as we anticipate delivering $2.25 billion of our pipeline between now and the end of 2019, with a significant portion already leased. And we expect to continue adding new development investments, as we've done this quarter.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator, I'd appreciate it if you could open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","I've got a bunch of questions. Let me just ask a couple then I'll get back in the queue. First, if I'm looking at your numbers on Salesforce Tower, is the all-in development cost $766 a foot? And is there any chance that Salesforce Tower will actually be a double in terms of valuation at stabilization? And then my second question is, Marriott doesn't stabilize until 2022. I'm imagining you're trying to tie that to Ray Ritchey's 50th birthday, but why so long?","Doug Linde","Well, on your first question, John, on Salesforce, we're not going to try and hazard a guess on how somebody might value the building. I think we generally view that high quality CBD assets that Owen has been describing for, I don't know, the last six quarters or seven quarters or eight quarters have been trading at valuations -- initial cap rates in somewhere between high 3s and low 5s depending upon the rent roll. I think the most interesting thing about Salesforce.com Tower is that it's underleased at this point. There's been so much growth in underlying rents in San Francisco that we have a big mark-to-market in that building.","So I think that there's a lot of value creation there. With regards to Marriott, that is simply a question of when their lease expired in Bethesda out in democracy and when we can physically build the building. We are going as quickly as we possibly can, and our hope is to start our foundation work in the middle of 2018, which will allow us to deliver the shell and core to Marriott to build out their TIs in the middle of 2021.","Owen Thomas","John, on the sales -- just to add to what Doug said on Salesforce, we've also said that we're going to deliver the building at -- in excess of a 7 yield. And as I've been pointing out, as Doug mentioned, the comps in San Francisco for new buildings are definitely in the 4s cap rate-wise. And per square foot values have been rising. They pierced $1,000 of square foot in the last year, and there have been several trades above $1,000 a foot.","Mike LaBelle","I think also, on Marriott, the one thing that Doug pointed out that's important is we're not going to be done with our obligation in 2021, which is building the shell. So it's kind of a 2.5-year, maybe a 3-year process. But Marriott is then going to do all their TI work and get into occupancy, and we can't recognize any revenue until they're done with that. So we're kind of -- we're dependent upon them to kind of finish that and be in sometime in '22 before we can actually book any revenue.","John Guinee","Well, let me ask another quick one. Morrison Foerster is a major tenant of yours. Is that the -- are they a major tenant in D.C.? And are they going to move to the OFC development site? Or is it a different city in which MoFo is an occupant? And then second, Owen, you talked about inflation being low. And I guess, for Owen or Doug, when you look at development costs, you look at operating expense, you look at labor. Does it actually feel as if inflation is as low as the national statistics indicate?","Doug Linde","So MoFo is a tenant at 250 West 55th Street, so we don't have any Washington, D.C. exposure. I get together with people in Boston. We talk about what you've described with the head of the Federal Reserve in Boston every 90 days. And my conversation and comments have been that we continue to see two things going on with the inputs for new buildings. One is that labor costs are going up, and they're going up at a reasonable rate. The average union contract, I think, has got a 3% or 3.5% annualized increase.","And it gets built into -- every six months, there's a portion of that that occurs. And the second is just how busy people are. And so the busier the sub-trades are, the less attractive it is for them to bid on new business, which means that they're bidding to lose effectively. And so they're pushing up their profit margins. And so those inputs are causing issues. And I think the one that's most interesting right now is, for example, the cost of concrete and the way the structures are being built in Washington, D.C. There seems to be so much going on that there's some significant pricing increases going on in that particular labor input.","So we are seeing a higher rate of increase in our construction costs, and we are building those escalations effectively into all of our budgets that we're putting together. And so all of our returns that we described to you assume that, that escalation is the input when we actually come to a [GNP] and we finalize the bids on all of our subs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","You've talked about a pretty active near-term development pipeline I think 2.5 million square feet you guys outlined. Is there a cap? I guess a couple of questions on that. I mean is there a cap that you guys would consider for sort of the development as a percent of total assets? How are you guys thinking about financing that growth? And then would any of that leasing be coming out of existing BXP space?","Owen Thomas","So Jed, to answer your question, we don't have a cap. We do obviously pay attention to how much development we have as a percent of our total enterprise. We think right now, it's around $3 billion. And we're over a $30 billion enterprise, so we think that's completely reasonable. However, I would also point out that these developments that we just added this quarter, they're 100% leased, so add very attractive development yield. So our real -- obviously, we have theoretical credit risk with the tenants, but also the delivery risk of the building in terms of costs and timing. But those are very different risks than building spec buildings or building partially-leased buildings. So again, we don't have a cap. And all of the development that I described is either fully pre-leased or very substantially pre-leased. And that continues to be a condition going forward.","Mike LaBelle","And only one of the tenants we're talking to in Washington has a presence with us in one of our buildings.","Owen Thomas","Yes.","Doug Linde","And on the funding side, I think we made it pretty clear, when Mike made his presentation and James Magaldi made their presentations at our Investor Conference, that our net debt-to-EBITDA is going down, down, down. And we are burning off a significant amount of the development pipeline that's currently in process because those buildings are coming to fruition, and they're going to be cash flow positive. And so, effectively what we're doing is replacing the $2.5 billion to $3 billion that's currently today underway with a similar amount, with a much higher capacity to use our balance sheet to fund that. So again, if the question is, do we have a concern about funding, and are we raising equity, I think the answer is we don't have a concern, and we're not planning on raising any equity.","Jed Reagan","And I guess two kind of housekeeping items on guidance for next year. I might have missed this, but are you projecting any dispositions for next year? And then in terms of your year-end 2018 occupancy, what type of growth or sort of backfilling of the 399 Park space does that project?","Mike LaBelle","So the guidance doesn't include any dispositions or acquisitions at all for 2018. And as I mentioned, at 399 Park, we do not expect any of that space to be in our occupancy figures in 2018. As I mentioned, the space, really, it's 20-year-old Citibank space that needs to be demoed and rebuilt. The new tenants coming in are going to be putting in their tenant improvements, and they won't be able to get those tenant improvements complete before the end of 2018 even if we signed a lease today. So we won't be able to get any revenue or any occupancy, we believe, in 399.","Jed Reagan","Even on a GAAP basis?","Mike LaBelle","Because the space is demoed, we can't start revenue. The GAAP rules are that the space has to be ready for its intended use. So if you have somebody that comes in and uses the existing improvements, even if they make some of their own changes on their own -- not necessarily dime, but on their own, then you cannot recognize revenue until they're done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","You've had some activity in Reston this quarter. Can you just comment on why you decided to sell the land to the corporate buyer rather than develop for them?","Owen Thomas","Sure. So the parcel of land that Ray will describe is more of a -- I guess, what you'd refer to as a greenbelt parcel as opposed to an urban parcel in the center of Reston. And it's a site that we've owned for the better part of 15 years, and it's really not part of the Reston Town Center development per se. It's actually physically, I think, 1.5 miles to the south. And so we had a corporate user who came along and said they wanted us to build the building for them. And we said, we'd love to build the building and lease it to you. And they said, we want to own and so, ultimately, we decided to sell it.","Doug Linde","And any time you can add a Fortune 50 name to the Reston tenant occupancy list, that's a plus. So it was not a strategically-important site, and it really just continues to validate Reston as the premier corporate location in the suburbs of Washington.","John Kim","Who is that company? And also, can you also discuss the additional 3 million of FAR that you're looking to entitle as far as the cost and the use of that land?","Raymond Ritchey","I guess we can release -- it's General Dynamics, right? I guess I just did.","Owen Thomas","I think you did.","Raymond Ritchey","And it's actually 3 million to 4 million square feet. It will be a rezoning of the land that's currently occupied by Reston Corporate Center. That's directly across the street from the Reston Town Center Metro stop. As part of the additional density comes forth with the introduction of Metro to Reston Town Center, it will be a mix of, again, between 3 million and 4 million square feet, half of which will be residential, half of which will be commercial. And again, we're bringing that on at a very competitive basis, given that it's land we've owned -- a building we've owned for over 20 years. Peter, do you have anything to add?","Peter Johnston","No, I think that sums it up. It's just going to be a continuation of the mixed-use development we've got in the urban core town center.","John Kim","At the GM Building, it's been over a year since you signed Under Armour for some of the retail space. Since then, their share price is down over 60%. Is there any risk that this lease does not go through?","Doug Linde","So the lease is in full force and effect, and we expect Under Armour will occupy the building. We're not delivering the space to Under Armour probably until the very end of 2018, and then they're going to have to build it out. So my guess is their plans don't assume that they're going to be in there for quite some time. Remember, Under Armour had $1.4 billion of sales this quarter. They still expect to be over $5 billion for 2017. Even after a restructuring charge, they had positive net income. They have a net debt-to-EBITDA of just 1.5 times. This is a real strong company, and there's no question that their growth trajectory has changed over the last two quarters. But we're believers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Mike, maybe just to help us with modeling or thinking about growth for next year. If you were to reaggregate NOI contribution from the same-store properties as well as the development properties and other external growth, how much year-over-year just NOI growth in general on both a GAAP and cash basis do you expect next year?","Doug Linde","I think that's a question he's got to -- I'm not going to let him answer until he does some math. I think that we attempted to give you an answer to that by describing the increase in our revenue from '17 to '18. The issue with doing it on an NOI basis is that the development contribution is dependent upon the buildings coming online, and the margin on those development pipelines changes over each quarter as the space is delivered. So I think Mike will have to get back to you on that one.","Mike LaBelle","I mean, the size of our same-store pool is $1.460 billion approximately. That's the kind of 2017 roughly same-store contribution. So if you want to add the $40 million to $50 million of development NOI to the guidance that I provided on the same-store of 0.5% to 2.5%, I guess, that's how you would get it.","Manny Korchman","Got it, that's helpful. And then, Mike, at the Investor Day, you gave a few nuggets of 2018 guidance without giving us full guidance. One of them was interest expense being up $25 million to $45 million. It looks like that increase is now smaller given the guidance last night. Is there anything specific driving that?","Mike LaBelle","No. I mean, there's nothing specific. Obviously, we do re-projections every quarter. We do re-projections on what our development outflows are and how they're going to be funded versus cash, versus use of our line based upon what our projections tell us. And that we've got some refinancing that we still need to do on a couple of loans that expire in 2018. So you kind of change around what you think the interest rates might be and some of the timing might be on that as well as, again, at -- last quarter, we expected that we would be in our line in December. We now don't expect that we'll be in our line until February, and that's simply a function of the development outflow changing a little bit. So when you kind of put all those things in the model, it just brought the interest expense down a little bit.","Owen Thomas","One of the most interesting things about when you do development is that we provide TI dollars to a lot of our customers. And a lot of them spend the money, and it takes them a long time to ask for it. And so the outflow that Salesforce Tower on the TI side are not insignificant, and there -- we just haven't gotten much of a draw yet. And so we're getting the advantage of not having to pay the capital out as early as we would have liked.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill.","Daniel Santos","Just two questions for me. The first one is on 2018 guidance. You guys gave a midpoint of $6.28, which is below where The Street is. Just wondering if you had any insight into what the major items that The Street is missing that caused that disconnect?","Mike LaBelle","We did our best to try to, at our Investor Conference and in the last couple of quarters, describe the impact that 399 Park would have on our same-store growth. If it weren't for those 200 basis points, our same-store would be up like 2.5% and 4.5%, which is really pretty strong, I think. So I feel like we tried to do everything we could in the major items. Perhaps the termination income that is down $18 million, maybe some people didn't kind of focus on that. ","Although, all the termination income that we're talking about for 2017 is already in the numbers, right, and we've already got $22.5 million of the $24 million that we project. So I think that we typically and The Street typically understands that we don't estimate that we're going to have big terminations in the following year that we don't know about. I also think that the refinancing of the GM Building was very confusing because of all the impact on our non-controlling interest and our interest expense.","And I'm very happy that it's now cleaned up, but until you kind of get through a full year of it or a full run rate of it, it's just kind of harder to estimate. So some of the non-controlling interest that -- I commented in here non-controlling interest in our guidance is up by $8 million, at the midpoint about $0.05. Maybe people didn't quite get that, and it really had to do with both their share of the demolition expense is not happening anymore in the GM Building refinance. So I think those are the areas.","Daniel Santos","And separately, given the desire to expand in L.A. and the CBS Studios being up for sale, do you guys have any interest in that asset?","Owen Thomas","We're not going to comment on specific investments that we're pursuing. As you know, we are -- our goal is to grow in L.A., and we're going to do it on a measured basis. We're actively looking at both development opportunities and acquisitions. I would say that our pipeline has probably improved over the last month since the Investor Conference. We've seen more things. I think having our new colleague, Jon Lange, on the ground in L.A. has also been very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Mike, thanks for the detailed guidance and a very comprehensive Investor Day. Can you talk about what the guidance means for your AFFO outlook? And also, any thoughts on dividend coverage and prospects for maybe a bump next year?","Mike LaBelle","So I think that our AFFO is going to be up. For 2017, we think it's going to be somewhere in the $4.20 to $4.25 range. And for 2018, I think that our range will be closer to kind of $4.35 to $4.65 range. Our same-store rents are going to be lower. I mean, our noncash rents are going to be lower. We've provided guidance of that. And I think our tenant transaction costs we've got to do about 2.8 million square feet of leasing to meet our occupancy goals.","So we think that that's probably somewhere between $180 million and $210 million of leasing transaction costs. And we should have a return CapEx of somewhere around $80 million to $90 million. And then if you kind of look at what our run rate is for stock compensation and straight-line ground rent and other stuff, you get adjustments of probably somewhere in the high 200s, $275 million to $300 million. So I think we're going to be up pretty strongly at the midpoint. That's up 8% over 2017, and it's actually up 40% since 2015. So our AFFO has been very, very strong growth over the last few years, as we've burned off a lot of free rent and things like that. What was the other question, Jamie?","Jamie Feldman","Just whether you'll start pushing up against the need to bump the dividend?","Mike LaBelle","Yes. So I mean, we've talked before about where we are and where we expect to be in 2017 from a taxable income perspective and our dividend, which is I think fairly close in line. We haven't made any decisions on our dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017. We're going to be meeting with our board in the fourth quarter to talk more about it. I mean, I can say that we believe our cash NOI is going to grow significantly over the next few years. And if we don't sell a lot of assets, which are not currently in our business plan, our expectation over the next few years is we would have dividend growth in line with what that growth is. But we haven't made any decisions yet about this year.","Jamie Feldman","And then I know at your Investor Day, you guys spent a lot of time talking about WeWork and coworking. Since that time, we've seen WeWork go direct into owning assets, buying assets. I'm just curious, is that something you guys expected to happen? And what are your general thoughts as a landlord as they do seem to be looking to own more assets going forward?","Owen Thomas","Our posture hasn't changed on coworking or on WeWork. As I think we have all described in different ways, we have felt that coworking and, therefore WeWork, has been a positive factor for the office business this cycle. I think we gave some data at the Investor Conference that coworking represented around 20% of the net absorption in the country. And again, that's a big positive.","With respect to WeWork investing in real estate, one thing that is -- certainly, if you study it, people are aware of, they're not doing it all themselves. They have a partnership with an outside fund manager. And I don't know the specifics of what the percentage interests are in all these properties, but WeWork is not buying all these buildings 100% onto their balance sheet. They're doing it, I assume, partially, but not fully. And they, again, have a partner with which -- with whom they're doing it. And we certainly haven't run into a situation where we have -- are competing with them for investing in a particular building.","Jamie Feldman","Any other color from anyone else?","Owen Thomas","No, I think that's it.","Jamie Feldman","And then just last for me. Ray, General Dynamics, the tenant you mentioned, would you say you're starting to see a meaningful turn here in defense contractors and leasing demand from defense in your region?","Raymond Ritchey","Well, clearly, we've been through a two-year or three-year cycle, where they've really been focused on cutting costs and perhaps uncertainty in the defense budget, and now we're seeing more clarity. We see more contracts being funded. We still see those defense users looking to be efficient in their space use and consolidate. And we see them going to locations like Reston Town Center, where they can recruit, retain and motivate the best and brightest. So it's always been a situation in Northern Virginia where the demand for space can rise and fall on the defense budget. But for now, right now, we're getting very good direction from these users that they'll continue to be taking down space and it's obviously very helpful for our specific market in Reston.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Stelzner with Morgan Stanley.","Nick Stelzner","So if I heard you correctly, you said that the rent roll-down at 767 was about 50% on a net basis. But overall, New York City was only down about 4%. I guess can you give a little color on the mark-to-market leasing for the rest of the New York portfolio? And I guess, was 767 the only space with a rent roll-down this quarter?","Doug Linde","From a weighting perspective, it bore way more than its fair share of the roll-down. As I said, we had about 190,000 square feet of space rolling over. And most of the space in New York City was rolling up. We had a couple of small pieces of space that rolled down. But if you were to pull that one out, we would have had a significant roll-up in New York City.","Nicholas Stelzner","And then I may have missed this earlier on, but could you give us an update on the leasing activity at 159 East 53rd?","Doug Linde","John Powers, do you want to take that one?","John Powers","Yes. I think we have two good prospects at 159. Both would take more than half the building. We hope we make one of those deals. And we have a number of smaller prospects, so I think it's going well. The curtain wall is almost done now, and it's showing much better than it did.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Doug, you guys don't have a lot of expirations in 2018, but some of them, especially in New York, have pretty high rental rates. So I'm guessing we're going to see some moderation in spreads this coming year. Is that the right way to think about it? And maybe, Mike, can you comment on any rent spread assumptions you guys have built into guidance?","Doug Linde","So there's very little rollover on a going-forward basis in New York City at this point. And so as we lease up space, what hits our statistics are, for the most part, the leases that are within one year. And so, for example, were we to lease the space at 399 that is currently available, you would see basically a flat number. The rents that rolled off were in between the high 80s and low 100s. And we expect the base of the building will be leased in the high 80s, and we expect the space in the tower will be leased in between $105 and $120 a square foot. So as I think I've said this for a couple of quarters, we're basically running to be in place at that building. If we were to lease the 33rd or 34th floor of the General Motors Building, there would be a very big roll-up because those rents were very low when we took the space back from Weil Gotshal. And those are the two major parts of the vacancy, where there was a second generation that occur in 2018.","Blaine Heck","And then, Mike, anything assumed specifically in guidance?","Mike LaBelle","For the 2018 rollovers?","Blaine Heck","Yes, for rent spreads?","Mike LaBelle","I think that as Doug said, the rent spreads are pretty flat. The one deal that we do have going on is we've got 60,000 square feet rolling at 601, where we've got an active tenant on one of those floors, that's two floors, in one of those floors. So that hopefully will happen with no downtime. The other floor we're going to assume is going to be down for a period of time. So I think for the most part, that rollover, we're expecting that it would have a negative impact on our 2018 guidance because we would have some downtime with all of that piece.","Doug Linde","But mark-to-market will be up.","Mike LaBelle","Yes.","Doug Linde","We're going to roll space that's leased at $105 a square foot and, hopefully, we'll get $120 or $125 a square foot. That's the sort of the nature of the difference in the rents.","Blaine Heck","And then Doug, you touched on this, but at 399 Park, you guys consolidated the space on seven, eight, nine and maybe even 10, if I'm remembering right, from the Investor Day. I think it totals around 250,000 square feet. Can you talk about whether that consolidation resulted in kind of a noticeable pickup in interest? And any more color on the types of tenants you're talking to and what stage of negotiations you are in at this point?","Doug Linde","I'll make one short comment, and I'll let John -- John, if you want. So big picture, what we did is we substituted a 102,000-square foot really big base floor on three with 2 60,000-square foot floors on eight and nine. So we immediately improved our sub-divisibility. John, you can talk about the block.","John Powers","Well, that eight and nine goes with seven, and we're also getting 10 back from Eton Park next year. So that's the block. And you're right, it's about 250,000 feet. And we have very good activity on the block. And that's much more leasable. It's further up in the building. It's more light and air. It's a little higher priced, but block of 250,000 feet with 60,000-foot center core, that's unique on Park Avenue. So we have good activity on it.","Blaine Heck","Owen, your commentary points to an investment sales market in New York that's, I guess, still somewhat active, but we've seen transactions come down substantially year-over-year, and there's been concern about the appetite from foreign capital sources. Can you just give us your view on how you expect pricing to trend in the next 12 months? Have we hit a bottom for cap rates? And do you think we'll see any meaningful expansion over the next year?","Owen Thomas","Well, as I said, transaction volume's down overall in the country. The number's around 27%, and it's true in New York as well. I do think more of the assets have traded to long-term institutional holders now, particularly the larger trophy assets like REITs and other institutional holders. And they're less frequent sellers versus investors that are more opportunistic and have a shorter-term time frame. And so by definition, I think you see less assets in the market, and I also think the investment community is becoming more exacting about risk. So is this building -- just being in New York's not good enough. Where is it in New York? What's the location? Public transportation? Neighborhood? And then the leasing status. The leasing risk is less of interest, and I think return requirements for those kinds of risk have gone up.","In terms of -- but that being said, I think there's a continual rotation of investors that are in and out of the market. I think that New York and our other gateway markets continue to be of interest to investors from Canada, the Middle East, Europe, China, Japan, Singapore, other places in Asia. I don't think that's changed. I think there is a little bit of cycling. Right now, perhaps the Chinese investors are a little bit less active. The Japanese investors are getting a little bit more active.","In terms of forecasting for next year, it's difficult. I do think it's going to be very related to interest rates. And as I mentioned, even though we see some things that might lead you to think interest rates will be higher, like the Fed increasing the short end of the curve and the gradual reduction of QE, I do think we're going to continue to operate in a relatively-low interest rate environment. And therefore, the yields from real estate will be attractive. And I think New York and our other gateway markets will continue to be of keen interest to institutional investors from around the world.","Mike LaBelle","I think the scarcity of the products as well.","Owen Thomas","I think what Mike's just saying with less buildings on the market that also creates more scarcity when one does come on the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Mike, on the $850 million maturing at the -- near the end of '18, just can you kind of give updated thoughts on how far out in the curve you guys are thinking to go there and what pricing expectations are in the guidance?","Mike LaBelle","So our guidance expectations are that we refinance it within 90 days of its maturity. There's an open window, and that we refinance it with a comparable term. So if you kind of look at our expiration ladder, 2028 is open for a 10-year deal. We can do a 10-year deal today at about 3.5%. Also open is 2025. So we could do a 7-year deal, and a 7-year deal is closer to 3.25% today. So I think that's what we probably would think about from a maturity perspective. I don't think we would go out and do a 30-year or something like that.","And with respect to timing, we'll see. We're always kind of monitoring the market and looking at where we think interest rates are going, where we think the bond market is going. And the bond market has been very [pitiful] in 2017. I have no reason to believe why it won't continue to be so, but we're consistently looking at those markets.","Craig Mailman","And we shouldn't expect -- you have a higher coupon piece maturing in October of '19. The make-whole would probably be too onerous to bring that in during '18. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it?","Mike LaBelle","It's fair to say that the prepayment penalty associated with the 19 and the 20s is pretty high, and which makes it a little bit less attractive to try to do something like that. We do these calculations all the time and thinking about it all the time, and we'll continue to do so, but it's certainly not in any guidance that we have.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Robert Simone","I was on mute. Just a quick question on the incremental debt. Mike, I think you mentioned that it was about $550 million on the term facility and the credit line. Is that -- the funding requirement there, is that solely from the existing development pipeline? Or does that contemplate any future developments? And I have one quick follow-up on interest expense.","Mike LaBelle","That's only assuming the existing pipeline that we've shown everybody. So it does not assume that we're successful in signing additional leases at some of the other properties that both Owen and Doug talked about, which would increase our pipeline. And some of those properties would start to fund in 2018, so that would increase the requirement to fund those and also increase our capitalized interest, however. Again, normally, funding development projects doesn't necessarily increase your interest expense because you've got a capitalized interest offset. But in this case, we're delivering a lot of stuff in '17 and '18, which causes us not to kind of get the benefit of that, which is why almost all of the funding that we have projected so far for '18 kind of just drops into the interest expense bucket as an increase in interest expense.","Robert Simone","And then one final last question. Mike, you mentioned that the Colorado Center financing was going to increase your share of interest expense from unconsolidated by about $5 million. The range that you guys provide for guidance, is that only on a consolidated basis? Or is that inclusive of your share of all interest expense, just for clarity?","Mike LaBelle","The range we provide is only on a consolidated basis. So it's kind of unusual that we have a big change on the unconsolidated JVs, and it's typically pretty small because that portfolio's pretty small. But this quarter, obviously, I wanted to point it out because it does affect '18. We -- on the NOI for the unconsolidated properties, we include that in our same-store guidance, our share. So the only thing we kind of don't pick up is any changes in interest expense that might affect year-to-year. And as I said, typically, it doesn't have much of an impact. This year, it does, which is why I wanted to point it out on the call and to put it in our press release.","Owen Thomas","That completes our call. Thank you for your questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in Dallas in a couple of weeks. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day."],"3425":["Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Q1 2014 Earnings Call April 30, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arista Joyner - Investor Relations Manager","Mortimer B.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arista Joyner, Investor Relations Manager for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.","Arista Joyner","Good morning, and welcome to Boston Properties' First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.","Mortimer B. Zuckerman","Good morning, everybody. This is Mort Zuckerman speaking. There's a little bit of construction job going on behind me, so you're going to hear a little bit of noise, somebody breaking up the sidewalk, but in fact that is a noise that we have always enjoyed in a way because that's what we do. We basically have had a long-term strategy, which we continue to focus on, of building long-term values and assets that we can hold for the long-term because we believe they will appreciate over the long-term. And we try and create a certain core value in terms of being at the very upper end of the quality of the assets in each market that we are in. And we are involved, therefore, in 2 things. One is maintaining and owning for the long-term a lot of investment assets, which we can go over. But the ones that really continue to grow the company are through the development programs that we have always had on our agenda and which we have today in a very strong way. In all of our markets virtually, Atlantic Wharf, block 5, 601 Mass Avenue. And the ones that have gotten the most attention recently are 535 Mission Street in San Francisco, where the activity is very strong and where we believe we will be creating significant value and a long-term investment pool [ph]; and Transbay in San Francisco as well, which is probably the most challenging and attractive opportunity that we have had, where we're building a 1,400,000 square-foot building. Both on the 535 Mission Street where we have a very strong activity, we've signed leases for over 80,000 square feet and we have very strong activity that is on the verge of being expressed in signed leases. And with the Transbay, as we call it, although we're now going to rename the building, we have had a very good experience in terms of having a signed lease now with a tenant who's going to take slightly over 50% of the building and the space that we will have remaining will be the upper sectors of the building, all of -- every floor which will have great views and great identity. And I do believe that, that building will be the iconic building in San Francisco for generations to come since it is going to be a couple of hundred feet taller than any other building. It's going to have great views and will become, we believe and hope, the iconic building that will symbolize San Francisco and its reemergence as one of the great innovative cities in America.","I could go through a lot of other dimensions of our business, but I'll just mention that again, the long-term strategy of having high-rise, high-quality, highest-quality where we can, buildings in every aspect of our business continues to pay dividends. In that we are continuing to lease up whatever limited amount of space we have. The large tenants in those kinds of buildings, simply -- we do not have the space for them, but we have a lot of smaller tenants. And those buildings, therefore, are constantly being filled up in the niche spaces that we have remaining. And we're, frankly, very pleased with the performance of all of our, in particular, heads of the different regions. We'll be covering that in detail, but I think you'll come to the conclusion that we are still in a very difficult environment, which I think we are in on a macro basis, continuing to do well. Partly, of course, it is because we've specifically focused in on certain markets, Washington, New York, Boston and San Francisco, all of whom have the kind of urban ingredients, particularly those capacities and attributes that attract high-tech, high-quality companies into those markets. And so we've been able to participate in the growth of those cities in terms of the kinds of tenants who want to go into the very best buildings, and those continue to work for us. I'm not going to go through every development that we have on our agenda, but I think you will get a feel from it as we go through our different offices. But suffice it to say that in the area of the city -- of the country rather, that we made our biggest commitment, which was San Francisco, we landed Salesforce for a 714,000 square foot lease and we're doing extraordinarily well in 535 Mission. And as you will hear, through the reports that we make, we're continuing with development in our various markets, not only developments that we have underway, but developments that we are working on and planning for the future. So that we can continue to grow the company in the context of what is clearly and may continue to be, and I believe it will continue to be, a much more sluggish economy than most people have been predicting. Although I have to say we have been kind of very conservative about our estimates of how the macroeconomy will work. But we believe we're in the best markets for office space and we have the best buildings in these markets and we are continuing to build and develop in these markets, and lease up our space and keep our buildings at the cutting edge of quality.","So with that, if I may, I'll just end my comments and turn it back over to Owen, if you don't mind, Owen.","Owen D. Thomas","Okay. Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone. This is Owen Thomas. I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, building on some of the remarks that Mort made, and also I'll touch on our overall performance for the first quarter. I'll then provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and execution. Doug's then going to discuss our markets and operational performance and we'll finish up with Mike LaBelle who will provide more color on our financial results for the first quarter. So starting with the environment, which Mort touched on. I think demonstrated by this morning's weak and likely weather-related GDP numbers, the U.S. economy continues to experience, in the aggregate, uneven growth characteristics. Though I do think overall business sentiment seems to be improving slightly. Traditional tenants are not growing rapidly. And in selected cases, they are reducing their space needs. However, this has been counterbalanced by explosive growth in many creative industries that we serve, such as technology and life sciences. As a company, we continue to experience very favorable market conditions in San Francisco, Cambridge, suburban Boston and, to some degree, Midtown Manhattan. Overall employment in Washington, D.C., however, continues to be reliant on government-related and legal industry. And we've not yet seen a strong catalyst for incremental demand in that market.","Switching to performance highlights. In the first quarter, we had several significant accomplishment. Mort touched on this as well, but certainly the most exciting news for our company in the quarter was the execution of a 714,000 square-foot lease with salesforce.com at the now renamed Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. With the salesforce.com lease, we've now agreed to commence the full development of this 1.4 million square-foot tower at a total cost, including capitalized interest, of $1.1 billion. You recall, in our efforts to manage the risk of this large scale development, we were seeking to secure an anchor tenant and considering introducing a joint venture capital partner. With a large anchor tenant now secured, we are no longer considering a joint venture capital partner to complete the development.","Now more broadly in our portfolio, we executed 97 leases, representing 1.6 million square feet, with the Boston and New York regions being the largest contributors. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are now 92.4% leased, down 100 basis points from 93.4% leased at year end. This reduction is due primarily to the forecast tenant rollover at 101 Huntington, a space that has already been re-leased, but will have downtime until early 2015.","Further in the quarter, we also continue to make progress leasing our remaining development pipeline, which Doug will get into in greater detail. And in terms of operating performance for the quarter, we were slightly below our FFO forecast, due primarily to weather-related expenses. So we are modestly increasing the bottom of our guidance range for full year 2014, and Mike will cover these items in greater detail in his remarks.","Now turning to capital strategy. As all of you know, interest rates actually declined over the last quarter and year-to-date. Specifically year-to-date, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped 30 basis points, approximately, to 2.7%. And the prospects for rising interest rates appear to be more benign, at least in the short to medium term. Private capital for real estate in our core markets remains plentiful, and if anything, has gotten more aggressive over the last quarter as evidenced by specific completed transactions. Our capital strategy remains consistent with what we have been communicating to you over the last several quarters. First, we have and we'll continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But, as mentioned, we continue to find the market very competitive. Notwithstanding this environment, year-to-date, we have made a small number of targeted acquisition proposals, totaling just under $250 million, on buildings in our core markets, and several of these situations remain fluid. Second, given the robust private capital market, we continue to actively monetize assets. In 2013, as you know, we sold $1.25 billion in total assets and expect our monetization activity to be at least $1 billion for 2014. Assets that we've targeted for disposition are in 1 of 2 categories: they are either buildings that are non-core to our ongoing business strategy; or assets where we believe the investment market will aggressively underwrite future growth prospects. In terms of our current sales pipeline, we've received an unsolicited offer to buy a portion of our Mountain View single-story product and we are in active negotiations. We are also in discussions with a purchaser for The Avenue, our Class A apartment building in Washington, D.C. The outcome of these negotiations is unclear at the moment. We're also in the market with Patriots Park, which is a 706,000 square-foot suburban office building located in Reston, Virginia, which is 100% leased on a long-term basis to the GSA. Lastly, we're exploring a recapitalization of Carnegie Center in Princeton, and considering JVs on several additional assets.","Now, lastly on capital strategy. As discussed in prior quarters, and Mort touched on this as well, we continue to make the vast majority of our new investments in development. In our core markets, we are at that point in the real estate cycle where new properties can be delivered at lower cost per square foot and higher yields than where existing older properties are trading. With the delivery of The Avant, a 359-unit apartment building in Reston, Virginia, and the commencement of full development of the Salesforce Tower, our active development pipeline now consists of 7 projects with a total projected cost of $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion at year end. Further, as described last quarter, we are in the predevelopment stage on another set of projects with strong potential. And these include North Station and 888 Boylston in Boston, a residential building at Kendall Square, 10 and 20 CityPoint in Waltham, additional sites in Reston and 501 K Street in Washington, D.C. In the aggregate, our share of these projects represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.5 billion in gross development cost.","Lastly, a quick note on a personnel matter. Mickey Landis announced his retirement from Boston Properties in the last quarter, and we are very appreciative of Mickey's many contributions as the leader of our Princeton office during his 16 years with our company. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Doug.","Douglas T. Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. It's Doug Linde speaking. I want to start off with a couple of comments on Transbay and put a little bit of meat on the bone, so you have a perspective of what's going on there. Interestingly, it was about a year ago that we actually announced the 95-5 JV with Heinz, we're the 95% obviously. And you may remember, there were many, many questions from investors and analysts regarding what our plans were, how much pre-leasing would we need and when would we start the building on spec. And I think we were noncommittal and vague, to put it mildly. But we basically said, look, we like the market, we think the market is going to get better. And lo and behold, we're now sitting here with a building under construction with a 714,000 square-foot lease. So as soon as we released the news a few weeks ago that we had signed that lease, lo and behold, we started getting lots of questions about the size of the Salesforce commitment and were we concerned about Salesforce. So we actually have spent a lot of time with the Salesforce leadership, and Mike and his team have done a very thorough credit analysis, and so I actually have asked Mike to spend a few minutes about Salesforce and their business in his remarks so we can hopefully provide a little bit of color on what they do and how we think about them and what the issues are regarding their commitment to the building.","We've included the total cost of the Salesforce Tower in our supplemental materials, and it's about an $800-a-square-foot development. That includes an imputed cost of equity and debt, which is our typical method for quoting our development return and our yields on cost. But in fact, it actually overstates the overall cost. So the cost is going to, at the end of the day, be lower than that on a GAAP basis when we actually close our books on the transaction. Salesforce is going to be accepting space in various blocks, commencing in April of 2017, and their final block is going to be delivered in October of 2018. So at that point, in 2018, the annualized rent that Salesforce will be paying on that entire block of space will be in the low 50s. We expect to achieve a higher return and a higher rent on the remainder of the available space, which, again, is $432 and above, and we expect that our pro forma cash return on -- again on that $1.1 billion, will be in excess of 7%. Again, the rents that I just quoted are what the starting rent will be and in San Francisco, the market typically has either $1 or $1.05 bumps, or 1% to 3% bumps per year on those leases. So again, on a GAAP basis, the numbers will be higher than what they are on a cash basis.","It has really been a pretty extraordinary beginning to the year in San Francisco in 2014. We had Twitter and Dropbox and EverBrite [ph] and Practice Fusion and Bare Essentials and Trulia and Salesforce all expand. And with the recent announcement that LinkedIn has signed a lease at 222 Second, all of the competing new construction pipeline has been committed, with the exception of 420,000 square feet at our 181 Fremont, which has a 13,000 square-foot floorplate. So it's a building more suited to the demand that we're seeing at 535 Mission. And then there's been a recent announcement that Lincoln Properties is supposed to start construction at 330 Bush, which is a 370,000 square-foot building, just on the backside of 555 Cal, off of Kearny Street and Bush, more in the north financial district.","The San Francisco CBD continues to be, obviously, the strongest market -- urban market in our portfolio. And it's really this growth in tech that is expanding into traditional office buildings that's leading the growth and the strength in the market. We still have Pinterest and First Republic and Splunk and Uber were all in the market looking for over 100,000 square feet or more. The pace of activity in '14 is ahead of where it was in '13 and in '12, and there are also a lot of traditional users who are now conducting searches as the wave of lease expirations between 2015 and 2017 hit the market. Now those aren't necessarily expansions, but there are likely to be some musical chairs and some movements and we hope the Transbay -- the Salesforce Tower, excuse me, is going to be the beneficiary of much of those tenants.","As Mort said, we signed our first lease at 535 Mission with Trulia for 84,000 square feet and they are at the base of that building and will be moving in, in the fourth quarter of 2014, so less than 6 months from now. We have strong interest from single and multi-floor users and we expect to sign our next lease in a few days. We are about 15% above our pro forma rents, which were in the mid-40s triple net, and we are again projecting a low 7% return on cost. Here the cost is about $700 a square foot. Just to give you a reference point, the last major sale in San Francisco was 101 Second, which sold for $767 a square foot, a sub-4% NOI return.","Activity at Embarcadero Center is pretty limited, given that we're 95% occupied. We did about 7 deals this quarter, totaling 50,000 square feet and a few more over the last few days in April to add 20,000 square feet of additional leasing. We continue to market the 3 full view floors at EC4, those are at the top of the building. And while we're in discussions with a few tenants there now, we don't expect any 2014 revenue impact. Most of the tenants will have rent commencements in 2015. Net rents in our second-generation statistics in the supplemental show an increase of about 18% on leases that commenced during the quarter, which is in line with what we've anticipated, which is about a 15% to 25% markup on any individual lease. Down in the valley, our activities in Mountain View have continued to be very strong. At Mountain View Research, we've signed 169,000 square-foot of tenants, rents in excess of $32 triple net, and we have another 60,000 square feet in active negotiation. And we've leased all of the available space at our El Camino office building in Mountain View where rents are over $43 triple net. Activity at Zanker Road in North San Jose, however, has been limited. And that's where our largest availability is today, which is 437,000 square feet.","Shifting to DC. We purchased a 50% interest in a future development site at 501 K Street from the Stuart [ph] family and we have commenced design and permitting on a 520,000 square-foot office building. We've actually taken a different approach to the building by responding to the high-performance workspace needs of both the traditional D.C. users, i.e. law firms and GSA, but also technology and non-law firm users, by adding large collaborative gathering areas throughout the building. We have 4 or 5 different 2-story spaces that we've been able to create, which could or couldn't be used depending upon the various uses of the tenant, but really make the building a different kind of building. The city is aware that it needs to expand its job generator, and we are designing a product that might attract this new user. We are also moving forward with the permitting of a 276,000 square-foot office retail building in the urban core of Reston Town Center, the strongest market in the Reston area and the strongest market in the D.C. area. As well as 2 additional residential buildings, which have about 25,000 square feet of additional retail space that'll tie right into our Reston Town Center retail. That's the site that we purchased last year, called the Signature site. The earliest construction commencement will be in the third quarter of 2015 for any of these new Reston transactions. We are in the midst of leasing at the Avant in Reston, which opened in December, and as of the end of last week, we have leased 100 out of the 359 units there.","The bulk of our D.C. regional growth has been concentrated in Reston, which continues, as I said, to be the strongest submarket in the region. Our largest near-term lease in Reston is a rollover with the GSA and they've already notified us that they intend to extend that 251,000 square feet lease which expires 12\/31\/2014. We're in this awkward position of having 4 million square feet of office space and no inventory. We actually have a few tenants within the portfolio that have, for various reasons, put some sublet space on the market and much of our activity is actually responding to inquiries on this space from tenants that are interested in direct deals or subextensions. Again, rents in Reston are $15 to $25 per square foot above what you can get on other buildings on the toll route. The downsizing of the legal firms in the GSA densification continues to be an issue in the D.C. market. We've talked about it before and we'll continue to talk about it. We have limited 2014 exposure, but we do anticipate some churn in our D.C. assets with large law firms that have entered into discussions with -- and we've entered into discussions with our legal customers for our 2015 to 2019 expirations, about some space take-backs and long-term renewals. Some of these transactions could affect our earnings in prior years to the actual lease expiration, a.k.a. potentially next year, 2015.","I also want to reiterate that what we discussed last quarter, which was 8% of our total company NOI comes from the CBD D.C. portfolio. The majority of our Washington, D.C. regional NOI is generated in Reston. The CBD portfolio continues to be 95% leased.","Turning to New York. Our first quarter New York City activity on the in-service portfolio was really a continuation of what we've been seeing over the last year. We completed 24 transactions, totaling 537,000 square feet in our operating portfolio; which, by the way, now includes Princeton, and there were 3 deals in Princeton totaling 239,000 square feet. We did 7 more deals at 510 Madison during the quarter and we are currently in lease negotiations with 2 more tenants on 2 full floors and 2 more pre-built suites. If we complete these deals, knock on wood, which we hope to do, we will have 1 available full floor. It will be 95% leased at 510 Madison. The information in our supplemental, by the way, only shows leases that have actually commenced, which is why the numbers are a little bit different. Rent doesn't necessarily commence until 2015 on some of these floors, so much of the leasing we're doing right now really won't impact our 2014 revenues. At 540 Madison, we've completed 3 more deals, leaving only 33,000 square feet of availability at the base of the building. Demand from the high-end financial services firms continues into 2014, which is what Owen was referring to when he said we were feeling good about the Midtown market. And the fact that spaces are becoming more limited allowing us to maintain or modestly increase our pricing on some of the smaller suites. We completed 3 office extensions at the General Motors Building this quarter, including one expansion in the upper third of the asset. In July, we'll be getting back the 26th floor and we intend on demolishing it and offering it on a full floor or a partial-floor basis. We are now documenting a 15-year extension with Apple taking their lease out until 2031 down at the retail. They will also be expanding their core - concourse space by adding some currently landlocked units that really are not in service, which may allow them to expand their selling area as well. Cartier is now open. In total, the retail space at the General Motors Building, including our stores on Madison Avenue, currently generates $61 million of revenue on 100,000 square feet, including the Apple concourse and the FAO's second floor and concourse spaces. FAO's lease expires in early 2017.","Morrison & Foerster moved into physical occupancy at 250 West 55th a few weeks ago, in addition to a few pre-built tenants on the 16th floor. Last quarter, we reported the signing of our lease with Soros Fund Management. This quarter, we completed 5 more deals, totaling 55,000 square feet and last week we signed an 85,000 square-foot lease with Al Jazeera network for some of the ground floor space, the entire second floor and a tower floor. We have 4 additional transactions in lease negotiations, totaling another 25,000 square feet. To date, we've leased 721,000 square feet. And with the pending transactions, we get to 746,000 or 75% leased. We continue to have an active pipeline of 1- and 2-floor prospects that continue to tour the remaining space, as well as users that are looking at our few remaining pre-built suites.","At Carnegie Center, we continue to gain both occupancy and extend leases. As I said, during the quarter, we did 3 more leases for 239,000 square feet. In New York City, not unlike D.C., we are actively engaged with a number of our large law firm tenants regarding space utilization, redesign and extension. We have 5 such discussions underway, which could involve transactions well before lease expirations in 2015 and beyond. In addition, we've received notice from Citibank that they are terminating 174,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue in 2016 with the right -- and we have begun to market that space today.","Our development activities in the Boston region are continuing to advance. At the Prudential Center, we are negotiating a lease with an anchor tenant for the base of 888 Wilson Street, our 365,000 square feet of office space on top of 60,000 square feet of new retail space at the Prudential shops. This is a $275 million project including all carry and land at current market value that we expect to commence in the third quarter. In addition, we're planning a complete renovation and modest extension of our quick serve food operation, a.k.a. our food court, and potentially adding a 17,000 square-foot second-story addition to a portion of our Boylston arcade. These 2 retail projects have a combined cost of the between $30 million and $40 million. We anticipate temporarily closing down portions of the retail during the latter parts of 2014 and most of '15, and that will impact our revenue and is built into our projection. In Waltham, we're negotiating an anchor lease for 10 and 20 CityPoint, our 446,000 square-foot two-phase development. 10 CityPoint is a 230,000 square-foot office building with 16,000 square feet of retail and a project cost of about $108 million and tenant will take more than half of the office space. Just down the street, we've completed entitlements for a 16,000 square-foot stand-alone retail building, with future residential or hotel capacity, that we're not planning on for a while. We have 2 restaurant leases under negotiation for that small -- what we refer to as the stack. While this is a small $12 million project, it's an important element in creating a stronger amenity base and sense of community for CityPoint; where we currently have 516,000 square feet of existing office space, over 1.2 million square feet of additional office density, including 10 and 20 CityPoint, as well as our other 1.3 million square feet of existing assets at this critical interchange in Waltham, Massachusetts. In Cambridge, we're busy designing our new residential building, likely to start in the first or second quarter of 2015. In addition, we have -- to our new residential project, we're working with the city on our 600,000 square feet of additional office density and 400,000 square foot of residential density at other sites in Cambridge Center. In the meantime, we've completed additional early renewals at 5 Cambridge Center and 10 Cambridge Center, totaling 223,000 square feet. The combined markup on these leases is 50% on a net basis.","In the Back Bay, we completed 50 -- 90,000 square feet of renewals at the Hancock Tower and 82,000 square feet of renewals at the Prudential Center during the quarter. And over the last few weeks, we've completed another 140,000 square feet of long-term relocations and renewals at the Hancock Tower. The suburban office market continues to be really active as Owen suggested. Large blocks of space have disappeared, forcing larger tenants to consider new construction such as our anchor tenant at 10 and 20 CityPoint. Rents in Waltham were up another 10% during the last few months, and are over $40 a square foot for any new construction. We completed 290,000 square feet of leases in Waltham and Lexington this quarter, and we continue to see strong activity in our Waltham assets with much of it continuing to be from expanding life sciences and tech companies. You might have noticed the negative second quarter stat in our supplemental for Boston, and this -- there is a simple explanation for this. Included in these figures is a 75,000 square foot 10-year lease extension that we actually completed in 2010, at 111 Huntington Avenue, that's just commencing. If you eliminate that transaction, the net goes from a negative 13% to a positive 4%. So as Owen stated, as we head into 2014, our investment activities continue to be focused on our active development pipeline. It was a great, great quarter in advancing our development activities, and we look forward to additional announcements in the quarters ahead. I will end my formal remarks and I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael E. LaBelle","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned and Owen mentioned, we're delighted with the opportunity to expand our relationship with a tenant of the quality of salesforce.com. Whenever we're engaged with a prospective tenant, we conduct a thorough credit review to ensure our comfort with the ability of the tenant to perform over the term of the lease and with our tenant-specific capital investment. In the case of salesforce.com, we have a company that has matured into a force in the customer relationship management software business. CRM software is utilized by companies to manage their sales process, client communication and marketing. It's an integral component of sales platforms. It creates a sticky annuity-like revenue stream for companies like salesforce.com. And salesforce.com has increased its market share significantly over the past few years and is now a clear leader in the industry. They have hundreds and -- hundreds of thousands of unique customers across the globe. The company's sales have been growing at a 30% annual clip and last year totaled $4 billion, with revenue guidance given for next year of over $5 billion. Although GAAP profitability is below breakeven, as they reinvest in R&D and they're growing their headcount, the free cash flow has been growing and is in excess of $500 million a year, and they maintain a strong balance sheet.","As we track the leasing activity in San Francisco, many of the technology companies that are driving the demand for office space are more mature, higher-credit companies, which we think bodes well for the continued strength of the office market. In addition to companies like salesforce.com and LinkedIn, whose expansions have been widely covered, others, including Google, Adobe, Autodesk, Macys.com, Riverbed, Trulia, Amazon, athenahealth and Visa have also expanded in the city. Clearly, there continue to be startups and other early-stage companies in the market as well, but the plethora of more mature companies differentiates this cycle from past cycles.","During the first quarter, we repaid our $747 million of exchangeable notes and paid a special dividend of $2.25 per share. Our cash position is now $1.2 billion and is the primary source for the funding of our growing development pipeline. With the addition of the full cost for Salesforce Tower, our development pipeline now stands at $3.2 billion, with $1.4 billion of cost remaining to fund over the next few years. With our strong cash position, we do not anticipate raising additional debt or equity capital this year, although as Owen mentioned, raising capital through asset sales remains likely. We do expect to extend and reload our ATM equity program this quarter as it expires in June, although we have no immediate plans to use it. As our development pipeline comes into service over the next few years and we gain the revenue contribution from the assets, our operating cash flow will grow significantly.","Our portfolio continues to demonstrate strong performance, with first quarter same-store cash NOI up by 5.6% and GAAP NOI up by 2.3% from the first quarter last year. The improvement is the cost of portfolio and is the result of free rent burning off on a few large leases, as well as over 60 basis points of portfolio occupancy improvement, mostly in Boston and New York City. As we anticipated and discussed on our last call, our occupancy dipped slightly from last quarter to 92.4% today due to the move-outs that Owen mentioned in Boston, as well as Lockheed Martin moving out of 165,000 square feet at Zanker Road in North San Jose.","Turning to our earnings. We reported funds from operations for the quarter of $1.20 per share, which was $0.01 below the low end of our guidance range. Our revenues were in line with our expectations. The driver of the variance was approximately $2 million of higher utilities and snow removal expense related to the unusually cold winter in the Northeast with above-average snow. In addition, our G&A expense for the quarter was above our guidance due to some staffing changes that accelerated compensation expense into the first quarter. In the quarter, we reorganized our Princeton region to report under the New York region. And as a result, we no longer will have a regional manager in Princeton. For the full year, our G&A guidance is unchanged.","As we look at the rest of 2014, and as Doug described in his comments, we have pockets of high-value available space in Boston at the Prudential Tower and 100 Federal Street. In San Francisco, we have 3 full floors at Embarcadero Center; and in New York city, we have available floors at 250 West 55th Street and in our Madison Avenue buildings. While marketing of the space is active, most tenants are looking for space for 2015 delivery, so we don't anticipate an economic impact from leasing the availability this year.","In Washington, D.C. and in Reston, we're virtually fully leased. In the suburban portfolio, we have good demand in suburban Boston, and we are now 86% leased, up from 78% a year ago. We have one large block of space left at Bay Colony, which is under negotiation for a 2015 occupancy, with the remaining availability in smaller units.","In suburban San Francisco, we had good activity in Mountain View, but the majority of our availability is in North San Jose and South San Francisco where the market is slower. Similarly, activity in the suburban DC markets in Maryland and in Springfield, Virginia are slow; and we don't project positive absorption this year. So based on the timing of our lease-up projections, we're really not anticipating meaningful improvement in our occupancy for the rest of 2014.","The renewals that Doug discussed in Cambridge, as well as the 100,000-square-foot renewal in the upper half of the GM Building, all with positive mark-to-market, will show up in our straight-line rents and possibly impact our same-store GAAP NOI. Our projection for 2014 same-store GAAP NOI is an increase of 1.75% to 2.5% over 2013. This is an increase of 50 basis points at the low end from our guidance last quarter. Our noncash straight line and fair value lease revenue for 2014 is projected to be $88 million to $98 million. Our 2014 cash NOI projections are unchanged from last quarter, and we project a strong 5% to 6% improvement from 2013. This growth equates to $60 million to $70 million of incremental cash NOI for the company.","In our development pipeline, we've made project -- progress in our leasing. Our 4-million-square-foot pipeline now stands at 67% leased. The incremental contribution to NOI from our developments in 2014 is projected to be $28 million to $30 million. Now the 2014 contribution is muted by the timing of our deliveries that come into service later in the year. And in addition, 250 West 55th Street and The Avant are still leasing up. The contribution in 2015 from leased properties will be significantly greater. When stabilized, we expect our pipeline to generate meaningful earnings growth, with a projected first-year stabilized cash return between 6.5% and 7% on $3.2 billion of total investment.","We project our hotel to generate modest improvement from our prior guidance and project its contribution to our 2014 NOI to be $13 million to $14 million. The contribution to 2014 FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures is in line with our prior guidance at $29 million to $34 million. We project development and management fee income for 2014 of $19 million to $22 million, also in line with last quarter's guidance.","And as I mentioned, our full year G&A projection is unchanged. We anticipate 2014 expense of $100 million to $104 million. We expect a reduction in our interest expense in the second quarter, reflecting the payoff of our $747 million exchangeable note issuance. However, our interest expense run rate will increase in the third and fourth quarters, as we cease capitalizing interest on 680 Folsom in the second quarter and on 250 West 55th Street in the second and third quarters. Overall, we project net interest expense for the full year to be $446 million to $450 million and includes capitalized interest of $52 million to $56 million. This is modestly better than we projected last quarter.","In summary, we're modifying our guidance range for funds from operations to $5.25 to $5.33 per share. This is an increase in our guidance of $0.025 per share at the midpoint and reflects a combination of improvement in projected same-store portfolio NOI and lower interest expense.","For the second quarter, we project funds from operations of $1.32 to $1.34 per share. We have not included the impact of any potential acquisitions, dispositions or new development starts in our guidance. As Owen mentioned, we are likely to execute on the sale of multiple assets later this year that would result in a loss of FFO, but the exact timing and magnitude are still uncertain.","In addition, we anticipate being in a position to commence the development of a couple of new development projects in Boston that could impact our capitalized interest projections. That completes our formal remarks. I would appreciate it if the operator will now open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first call is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Doug or Owen, just curious if you can talk about, in the context of flat occupancy for the rest of this year, just your thoughts about reaching where you guys normally are in the, say, mid-90s as opposed to where you're at today, over the next couple of years?","Owen D. Thomas","You mean the total portfolio?","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Owen D. Thomas","I -- honestly, I think that given the churn that we have within our portfolio on some of the larger transactions in Washington, D.C. and the transactions I described in New York City where, for the most part, the majority of the -- these large law firms are going to be giving back space, I would expect that our -- the ability of us to push occupancy in the short term, i.e. 2015, 2016, is going to be challenged. And I think we're probably going to be pretty close to where we are today, which is, what, 93% to 95%.","Douglas T. Linde","92% to 93%.","Owen D. Thomas","Yes, 93% to 95%. I think that's where you're going to see sort of us cap out at. We're not -- you're not going to see 96% or 97%.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then, can you also talk about the prospects for the rest of your space at Salesforce Tower and sort of what the timing might be on when we might see the you ink additional deals there?","Owen D. Thomas","I will just make the following comment, which is, we have an active group of tenants that are in the market looking for space. As I said, we have one of few blocks of available space that has a -- now has a certain delivery date. We are adjusting and thinking about our approach to the market vis-\u00e0-vis pricing and timing. And we are -- we have proposals outstanding, but there's no other transaction that we would consider imminent.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me, it sounds like San Francisco is still on fire with lots of demand. Just -- are you guys at all concerned with the recent thoughts on the NASDAQ and some of the high-flying tech stocks?","Owen D. Thomas","I think, and I'll let Bob describe sort of the leasing activity. And as Mike suggested, the majority of the demand right now, Michael, is from what I would refer to as non-high flyers. These are companies that have pretty solid revenue opportunities and actual business on their books. I mean, as an example, LinkedIn being the largest new user in San Francisco, that's a pretty -- what I would refer to as a utility right now for corporate America. And with some of the other larger requirements that are out there, these are not companies that are creating business models with lots of ideas and relatively little revenue. There's lots of revenue and lots of reinvestment. That's -- that is what is driving their need for space and their R&D. And, Bob, I don't know if you have any other thoughts.","Robert E. Pester","Yes, I would just add that the activity that we're seeing both at 535 and at Transbay is pretty much evenly split between tech and financial services and law firms. So we're not just dependent on tech to keep this market drive.","Operator","Your next call is from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just come back to a comment, Owen, that you made in your opening remarks about interest rate expectation and how they're shifting or, at least, the prospects for rising rates even a little bit more benign, I think, you said. Is that shifting at all your view of the environment in terms of what you're looking to do, be it on acquisitions versus dispositions?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, I think forecasting interest rates is a perilous duty, needless to say. But I do think that the common logic that interest rates are going to rise and the -- as they did last year in the short term, I do think that concern has abated somewhat. I would say, our overall view at Boston Properties is that we will, someday, face rising interest rates. It's just it seems like that's been put on hold, given what's occurred this quarter and given the sluggish economic growth that continues. I wouldn't say that it has shifted our approach. I mean, we -- our capital strategy, as I described, hasn't really shifted. I would say one thing that perhaps has shifted over the last quarter is I think in the private market, for assets in our core markets, has probably gotten more elevated over the last quarter. We're seeing the pricing for trades going up and certainly, the number of investors that are trafficking in the market, we think, is going up as well. So I don't think -- to answer your question in a sentence, I don't think we've changed our approach.","Douglas T. Linde","And Jordan, I'd add the following, which is Boston Properties has not traditionally been what I would refer to as a spread investor. We've had a long-term perspective in all of the assets that we purchased. And so we really look at the overall economic characteristics of the rents in the building and how that building is being positioned and what basis we're buying or building that building into. And the fact that lots of folks are looking at the opportunities to invest capital in real estate today because they can finance very cheaply is driving -- that plus the lack of yield anywhere in the world economy, is driving dollars being allocated to our kind of real estate and the kind of things that we would want to buy. So I would say that, sort of to be consistent with Owen, it's becoming more competitive and more difficult for us to underwrite acquisitions today. And so the sort of, I guess, the tit-for-tat on that is that we're probably a little bit more inclined to be sellers than we are buyers, largely due to where interest rates are. And we've seen, as Owen said, the bid for high-quality real estate and particularly, large bulky assets, continue and get stronger, not weaker.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, in the discussions surrounding the law firms in your portfolio, both -- it sounds like in D.C., as well as maybe Boston? Can you -- or D.C. and New York, I think. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what the potential impact might be, how they're looking to shrink and where we are in this sort of the evolution of what law firms are doing, at least within your portfolio?","Douglas T. Linde","So I guess, I'll answer it in 2 different ways. Any law firm that's installation is more than 7 or 8 years old probably has had a different view on how that space should be laid out, as well as how they're organizing their workforces. And so as those leases are expiring, they are looking to become more efficient and change the utilization. And that's creating some incremental additional capacity or organic supply to come onto the marketplace. I also think that there are certain areas of the legal industry that are seeing less in the way of growth opportunities, a.k.a. bankruptcy, right? So there are fewer transactions, and that's leading to some shrinkage in some law firms, just to what their overall business is. So both of those things are going on. I think that we are probably in the fifth or sixth inning of the densification portion of this. And some law firms, in fact, are actually growing on a marginal basis because they are getting bigger from a number of partner perspective, because they're taking partners from other firms or there's still consolidation going on. But net-net, there are more firms that are getting smaller than are sort of maintaining their same size.","Raymond A. Ritchey","I'll just add, Doug, this is Ray Ritchey, that we've also been very much a beneficiary of this movement. Arnold & Porter, Government [ph], 601, the activity at 250 West 55th, 500 North Capitol, 2200 Penn, obviously Embarcadero Center with some recent moves there. We've been very much the winner in that dynamic, as well as facing challenges in our existing portfolio. So it's also been a good thing for us.","Operator","Your next call is from George Auerbach of ISIS -- ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, Owen, just to touch on your last point about asset pricing, how meaningful is the impact of more foreign or cross-border buyers on IRRs in your market? It just -- it seems like on recent tours of D.C. and the West Coast it's been surprising how much greater the sort of cross-border activity is today versus the past cycles. Just wondering how you think fees and other -- all-cash buyers are influencing IRRs and cap rates?","Owen D. Thomas","I think it's meaningful. The buyer interest in assets in our core markets is not exclusively offshore buyers, but I think the flows are certainly increasing from non-U.S. buyers, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, other pools of capital, Asia, Canada, Europe and Middle East. I think it's a major force in the marketplace.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If I had to ask you to ballpark it, last 6 months, all-cash return hurdles are down 50 basis points?","Owen D. Thomas","I just want to say one thing, which is that, not all of these buyers are all-cash buyers. I think they are prepared to make all-cash bids, but many of them are low-leverage buyers. And whenever we have a conversation with one of the advisers, a.k.a. the Eastons [ph] or the CBREs or the HFS or the JLLs, you name your adviser, they are always quoting the leveraged return that they believe that these various capital pools are expecting to achieve with a low-leverage loan. So while there are certainly some that are prepared to do it on an all-cash basis, most of them, I think, are still looking at using and utilizing the opportunities on the -- in the debt side to enhance their returns. And I think those numbers, on a leverage basis, are somewhere in the low 7s to the low 8s, depending upon the asset mix itself.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Helpful. Last one for me. I know you build projects when it makes sense to, and not that there's certain investment dollar amounts. But given the pipeline of new opportunities that you laid out in your comments, Doug, how should we think about a reasonable amount of new starts for the company over the next 6 to 12 months?","Douglas T. Linde","I think in the next 6 to 12 months, there's probably somewhere in the range of $500 million of new starts.","Operator","Your next call is from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to come towards funding in terms of the pipeline. So you have the $1.4 billion that you now have committed for the current development pipeline, $1.5 billion of potential future development, Doug, which sounds like 500 would start potentially this year. You're obviously in an unbelievable capital position with $1.2 billion of cash, potentially $1 billion of sales under leveraged. You can go tap construction loans if you wanted to. I'm just trying to get a sense of does common equity ever enter the equation at all in your mind? I know LaBelle said that there's no debt or equity this year. But I'm just trying to get a picture of what the future may hold in terms of funding what will be $2.5 billion of future development?","Douglas T. Linde","I'll answer the question in the following way. Our current pipeline in our current business plan in terms of the asset activities that we have on the table don't contemplate the need for raising any additional equity. That does not mean that something different might not occur over the next 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, that would be a transaction that would be transformative in some way, shape or form that would not necessarily require that we do have some sort of an equity component to it. So the current business on the books does not necessitate any additional common equity.","Michael E. LaBelle","The other thing I would point out is that I mentioned we have a $3.2 billion development pipeline, with $1.4 billion left to fund. So we have $1.8 billion that's out the door and not generating any cash right now. And that's going to de-lever us pretty significantly. You mentioned our low leverage already, but it will continue to go down as these, as 250 and The Avant and 680 Folsom start generating cash flow in the next 6 to 18 months, which provides us with capacity to use debt if we need debt to fund the additional pipeline.","Douglas T. Linde","I guess the only other thing I would say is because there's some deals that we're looking at right now. There are some potential sellers that would do things on a \"OP [ph] basis\" that might suggest that we have a de minimis amount of equity that's associated with any one transaction, but that's really part of the structuring mechanism that we would use to be successful at the acquisition.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I think, you -- Doug, you talked about it's more difficult than to write acquisitions, and so I'm just curious in terms of that pipeline, sounds like on a wholly-owned basis, but whether you would find that a capital partner would want the sponsorship and the operating expertise for you to come in, in a joint venture where maybe they're a 45% owner or greater but would want BXP to join them in a large scale acquisition of a portfolio. Is that something that we should think about that you would be interested in doing?","Douglas T. Linde","Look, we are open-minded about acquisitions that our core market's in, and obviously, other places that would have this -- a similar profile from our -- from an operating platform perspective. I think there are relatively few large portfolios like that. I mean, there's a lot of talk right now about the portfolio in Boston that is being considered to be sold, which is at somewhere, I guess, in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion portfolio. And it's not something that we spend much time on because we like our position in Boston, we like our pricing in Boston, and it's not a portfolio that we necessarily think will be additive to our business plan. So it would have to be something that would be very unique.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just last question. You talked about sort of the occupancy trends. Can you talk a little bit about mark-to-market on the rollovers. If you sort of look at the remaining '14, '15 and '16 rollovers, both from a price per foot that's expiring, but the mix is very different, so if you look at your '15 roll, 30% is in New York and San Francisco, and you look at the '16, and all of a sudden that jumps to 60%. I'm just curious, as we think about what's expiring over the next almost 3 years, how should we think about the potential upside in those rents?","Douglas T. Linde","So as I recall, and I don't have all the figures right in front of me. But that in 2014 and 2015, the majority of our roll is below market across the portfolio. As we get into these transactions that we are sort of going into, that could be, what I would refer to as early renewal and potential take backs, some of those transactions are closer to market. And in certain cases, in New York City in particular, they're slightly above market. So I think that the 2017-ish area is a little bit more muted. And although we have a lot of San Francisco exposure in '16 and '17, and all of that exposure is somewhere between, as I said before, 15% and 25% below market, so it really enhances that. And we just went through our Cambridge portfolio. I mean, the markup was 50%. We did not anticipate a 50% markup on a net basis. I mean, we were sort of anticipating a markup that was 20% to 25%. The market's just exploded. And so if we have continued -- continue to see those types of changes, I think we'll be in a terrific position.","Operator","Your next call comes from John Guinee of Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I'm just going to -- get your pencils out, I'll give you a bunch of real quick questions. First, Patriot Ridge and Zanker Road were 2 examples of when the primary kind of moved out, gutting it -- the buildings down to the steel, I think, and starting again, do you have any more of those functionally-challenged assets in the portfolio? That's question one. Question two, what you've implied here with the asset sales and redevelopment -- dollars redeployed into development is either a special dividend or a dividend increase, assuming the tax basis is fairly low. Can you discuss that? And then three, can you briefly discuss just the capital staff [ph] on the Transbay? Are you putting up 100% of the dollars for effectively 100% of economics, or is it 95%-95%, or how does that all lay out?","Douglas T. Linde","Let me see, I'll start with the third one first. So we are a 95%-5% partner and we're responsible for 95% of the capital and Heinz is responsible for 5% of the capital. Right now, our view is that we're going to fund it with internal proceeds from our cash flow and our existing capital. And so there's no sort of change in that. It's fair to say that it's a building that we could put a construction loan on, but it's really -- it's not something we're thinking about at the moment. With regards to the second question -- the first question which is regards to sort of assets that are \"repositionable.\" I think the one area that we are looking at where there might be some additional stuff like that is, interestingly, our single-story stuff in VA 95. That's a park that has primarily been leased to the GSA and contractors of the GSA for, I don't know, Ray, 25 years?","Raymond A. Ritchey","At least.","Douglas T. Linde","And so as those buildings rollover and the GSA consolidates and densifies, some of those buildings probably have a repositioning opportunity and may need it in terms of being \"acceptable to the market,\" because they -- nothing's been done to those buildings for quite some time. But interestingly, John, we've actually quietly gotten rid of a lot of our other similar buildings to the stuff at -- it's Patriots Park, not Patriots Ridge, and Zanker Road over the last few years in the Boston portfolio, as well as in Maryland. And so there are -- those opportunities are few and far between. And then the dividend question is -- I want to -- unfortunately, I'm going to have to take a pass on, because the actual size of the sale, the various tax bases of the assets, are so different for the various things that we're looking that it's too hard to give an honest answer to whether or not we would have a special dividend or we would have an increase in our current dividend. I mean, I am assuming that most of the assets that we are considering selling have a relatively low basis. So the pattern that we went through in 2013, which was at the end of the year, to see if there were opportunities to deploy that capital into new acquisitions and new developments, would be the first alternative. And to the extent that we can't do that, we would have a dividend opportunity that we would announce towards the end of the calendar year.","Operator","Your next call comes from word from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the pricing per square foot for Salesforce as a tenant in the new tower, how do you think the price point you mentioned in the 50s compares to what you would've achieved if you went through the longer and, potentially, more arduous process of leasing floor by floor? Presumably, there's some sort of volume discount. So can talk about what you were willing to offer in order to secure such a great tenant?","Douglas T. Linde","So we think that low-50s on a triple-net basis was a good market deal. The -- interestingly, the way the discussions went, the tenant grew over time, and as the tenant grew, they got higher in the building and we felt that as you moved up the building, it was worth more or had a higher price associated with it. I honestly don't believe that we would have achieved a, necessarily, a premium if we sort of did it on a floor-by-floor basis. But one thing that we did do as part of the transaction, and you can think about how you might value this in lots of different ways and I'm not try and put a number on it, is that we did offer Salesforce the ability to name the building the Salesforce Tower. And that we viewed as a very important element for them, and one that we think was baked into the overall economics of the transaction. So I would say that there may not have been a discount per se associated with the rents that we were achieving on the lower 714,000 square feet of space, but that other attribute of the transaction was important to them. And it was something we were prepared to sort of throw into the pot.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then related to that, have you noticed any uptick in the interest level amongst other prospective tenants since you announced the good news with Salesforce and since you named the tower? Is their very presence a key selling point? Does it create any sort of buzz for the remaining space? Or would you say that any uptick in interest is more related to the simple fact that you're going forward with the project now?","Douglas T. Linde","Bob, you want to take that one?","Robert E. Pester","Yes, I would say that from a standpoint of perception in the market, that the fact that we're going forward is a big plus. And it clearly has generated the interest from tenants that were not looking at the building previously.","Operator","Your next call comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Jamie Feldman. You guys are in a unique perspective that you can see what the different tech demand looks like across San Francisco, Boston and New York. So I guess my first question is just can you talk a little bit about what they're doing in their space and how it differs by market? And along the same lines, as you look forward, where do you think you'll see the best growth across those 3 markets?","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. I'm trying to think about the best way to answer that question for you, Jamie. So why don\u2019t I do the following. Why don't I ask John Powers to talk about what's going on in New York City, and then Brian, you can give a quick summary of what you see in, particularly on the biotech and life sciences side in Cambridge. And then Bob, you can talk about San Francisco.","John Francis Powers","This is John Powers. Tech here has certainly grown in the last 4 or 5 years particularly. But defining tech in New York is, I think, a little different than in San Francisco because we have a lot of mature tech companies here, too. Overall, they are not a big player in the market, the whole tech sector, but the growth has been very outsized. And it's been primarily in the Midtown South area. So we have some conventional technology companies that utilize traditional space, but we also have the WeWorks and the other high-tech companies that are predominantly in the Midtown South.","Bryan J. Koop","Yes, this is Bryan speaking for Boston market. I think what we're seeing, which is really interesting, is we're seeing a little bit of a bifurcation of our tech tenants looking for different types of talent. And Doug mentioned earlier the growth that we've seen recently in Waltham, and I think that's really indicative. They're looking for an engineer or programmer that could be a little bit more mature, call it, in the family formation part of their life, and they are looking for those school districts. And that's been a big benefit for the Waltham market, what you've seen this big decrease in vacancy over the last quarter. And it's been really relatively quiet because there's been so much news about, call it, the drive for urban. We continue to see our urban tech tenants in Cambridge, their talent that they're searching for is younger, more millennium. And we see it in terms of the types of the space they're looking for as well. Doug mentioned biotech, it's a sector that we are continuing to see strong, strong growth, from great customers, for example, like Biogen. And yesterday, we were just at an event where we're opening up the Broad Institute building that we did with them, and I think it's indicative of what's to come.","Robert E. Pester","In San Francisco, I think, there's been a fundamental shift in the last 5 years as far as tech where they used to be in the valley and maybe had a satellite office in San Francisco, to now where you're seeing them do a wholesale move, and have a satellite office down in the valley with their headquarters in San Francisco. I think you also have to differentiate between what we refer to as mature tech tenants versus some of these start-ups. I would use the example of both Macys.com and Riverbed that wanted to be in a real office building, with real amenities, and has the power and HVAC capacity to have a density of 7 or 8 people per thousand square feet, which in fact, we have with both of those tenants in our building, versus the brick and timber building. And I think both Trulia and Salesforce validate that these Class A newer office buildings will attract tech as well as [indiscernible] type tenants.","Douglas T. Linde","So just to sort of conclude the comments, Jamie, I would say that if you were to sort of have to put it all together in terms of the way they're using their space and the way that the space is being built out or what's attractive to them. I think the individual buildings share a few common components which are: they are adaptable to open space usage with a limited number of impediments, i.e. columns; they have really great light and air. So they either have high-volume ceilings or they have high, large window exposures that will bring light into the space, because if you don't have -- if you have lots of people in there and you've got a very deep floor, you want to make sure you have lots of light and air. And then they're, for the most part, being amenitized with lots of food and eateries and other sort of smaller conveniences for those tenants on any individual floor. But that in itself is not necessarily the most critical component. In some of these markets, there's a question of where it's physically located, where the cool sort of happening place might be, which is why we see what's going on in Midtown South occurring. And a lot of those buildings are not buildings that are ideally suited to high-density, great space. I mean, these are all -- I mean these buildings are older, pre-war buildings that are -- they happen to be near Gramercy Park and near Union Square, and they happen to be on the L-line where all the people are living. And so it's a clear indication of the physical location is equally as important as the overall space. And honestly, I think that if you say which one was the priority, it's where it is and then what it is.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. I guess what I'm trying to get a little bit more at is just the functionality in the different markets. So if Google's leasing space in all 3, kind of what are they doing in the different 3 markets. And then how does that help you think about where they may grow the most going forward? Or is it safe to assume just if the companies are in San Francisco and they're going to grow, they're going to grow most in San Francisco?","Douglas T. Linde","I think it's a question of the maturity of the company and how they got to where they are. So Google in Cambridge, as an example, they acquired ITA. And ITA was a critical component to their travel business, and so it's also been a magnet for other types of acquisitions in the Boston area, similarly, to what Google did in New York City. I mean, it's both an engineering hub, as well as a sales hub. And I think a lot of these younger companies, over time, will potentially run out of resources, i.e. the critical component which is the human horsepower to run these businesses, and they're going to look for places in the world where other people of a similar -- with similar characteristics are currently working, and those happen to be places like Cambridge and like Boston and New York City and San Francisco. I mean, I've said this before; one of the things we watch on a quarterly basis is where the new capital is being invested on the VC side. And if you look over a long period of time, the 2 powerhouses have been the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, way above everyone else; and Boston Cambridge second. And over the past 5 to 6 years, New York City has become the third critical hub of that venture capital investing, particularly in the technology and the biotech life sciences world. And those 3 areas are where there is clearly a knowledge base of workers that are the horsepower behind these businesses' growth.","Bryan J. Koop","One further comment, Doug, is just -- your comment on place. Once the place is determined, you take an example like Biogen. There is a, we think, an increased conscious regard for the design of the space. And Biogen is a good example of a recent building we did with them. There's just a higher thoughtfulness in how the space is designed, how the associates are working together for just greater productivity and innovation. We continue to see that grow with -- more across the tech sector and in the biotech, surely.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just finally on the same topic. If you think about what happened in San Francisco, which is, first, they wanted the brick and timber, and now, they're more in the modern, urban-campus type buildings. If you look at New York where Midtown South is obviously pretty full at this point, what feels the most to you -- which submarket feels the most to you, like where they may want to expand next, how they're looking at your Transbay and the urban campuses?","Douglas T. Linde","John, you want to take that one?","John Francis Powers","Sure. Clearly, the Midtown South market has been the hottest market. And as Doug said, the product there is not exactly the, for the most part, the product that they want. So we have seen the few buildings in Brooklyn have a lot of activity and we think that will be leased up over the course of the year. Pricing in Downtown has also moved up significantly in the first quarter, and a lot of repricing in Downtown as tech companies -- or TAMI companies that are getting priced out of Midtown South as the tech companies take the space, are also moving to Downtown. And we've also seen some moves towards Midtown. So I think that the tech driver in the Midtown South is forcing a lot of decisions as the prices have gone up in that market.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. That's all helpful. But just one more follow-up. You had mentioned Citi giving up space at 601 Lex. Did they say anything about 399 Park, or is that still up in the air?","John Francis Powers","No. Our expectation is that they will leave 399 Park. They did their deal Downtown on Greenwich Street. They are in a planning mode this year to sort out where all the people go when it's all done. They'll probably be in construction for 2 or 3 years there to move everyone. And our expectation is that they will leave 399, but not the branch.","Operator","Your next call comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Owen, if I heard correctly in your opening comments, I think you said you're looking at a potential of $250 million of potential deals. Just want to get a sense, is that a gross number or is that just BXP's equity? Or are most of those development sites so that that's really land we're talking about, so it could be something more than that?","Owen D. Thomas","No, my comment on the $250 million was on acquisitions. So what we've been saying -- what I've been saying over the last few quarters is the acquisition market's been very competitive and we're finding it more challenging, although we're trying. And my point was is that over the last quarter or year-to-date, we've made proposals on various acquisitions that -- on a gross basis of $250 million. And those situations, several of them are not resolved at this time.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But are those development sites or those are [indiscernible].","Owen D. Thomas","These are the acquisitions of existing buildings. The development sites, dealt with separately with all the figures that I went through.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then for Ray. Just a bit more color on 501 K. Are you getting more enthusiastic about putting more dollars to work in D.C.? Or is this just a neighborhood play where you see there's likely to be a shift towards this neighborhood and therefore, this is a good opportunity?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, obviously as you know, this is the site directly across the street from 601 Mass where we're building Arnold & Porter, is now a block away from where it looks like Venable's going to move their headquarters. It's clearly -- it's 2 blocks away from Heinz's city center. And as Doug talked about, we have a full city block. We talked about a building that's 520,000 square feet; the density is actually closer to 560,000 or 570,000. And we're adapting the strategy there where less is more, and we're designing the building that, we think, is unique in the market, that not only could address the space needs of our traditional tenants, law firms, associations, but also can be exceedingly attractive to the tech tenants we've been addressing all morning. So we're very excited about it. We're excited about having a great partner like the Stuart [ph] family, full city block across the street from where we've already proven tremendous success in the development community and we're -- we couldn't be more excited about.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And does this -- does your activity here -- may heat up the competition more for the FBI site as people think there's more potential? Or they -- or people view a developed -- or people are still skeptical or cautious on development in D.C.?","Raymond A. Ritchey","Well, the FBI site is a completely different discussion. It's progressing. They're trying to pick the new site for the new location and then have a competition for the J. Edgar Hoover building on the avenue. That is many years away. 501 K is a much more immediate type of development opportunity.","Operator","Your next call comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was just wondering if you look at 55th Street leasing and also Salesforce Tower, how the rent has moved in San Francisco, if your return on cost expectation has improved, let's say, versus a year ago?","Douglas T. Linde","So I think that we've been pretty consistent that the return on cost on a traditional basis at 250 West 55th Street has been suboptimal, in our opinion, based upon when we conceived the project, because of the start and stop on it. But net-net, it's going to be somewhere just north of 6% on a NOI basis, sort of a non-GAAP perspective. And I think that our current lease-up is consistent with that type of a range. The Salesforce Tower building, I think, we have become more bullish on our expectations for what our overall return will be because we've been able to achieve a more significant premium to the rents that we entered when we originally conceived the project. I think when we started out a year ago, people said, \"Dude, where do you think you're going to be on this asset?\" And we said, \"I think it's going to be $800 a square foot. It's going to be somewhere between 6% and 7%.\" And today, what we're saying is it's going to be $800 a square foot and then we think it's going to be in excess of 7%.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other quick question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks a new direction perhaps for Princeton and maybe Mountain View. Could you just be a little bit more specific?","Douglas T. Linde","Yes, Owen said 2 things. He said that we're doing a -- we're recapitalizing Princeton, which is really a question of, right now, the property is 100% owned by Boston Properties and there's no debt on it. And so we're saying to the market, \"Is anybody interested in being our partner? And if you're interested in being our partner, would we be interested in putting some debt on it if that was the right execution?\" So that's the process we're going through. And then in Mountain View, Owen said that we have an unsolicited offer on a portion of our single-story assets, and we're exploring that alternative.","Operator","Your next call comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. First, when you guys recast the Apple lease, are all those over overage rents going to get put in as fixed-base going forward?","Douglas T. Linde","So let me -- I'm going to give you an uninspired and probably non -- not very committal answer, which is we don't really talk about how we structure any individual lease. We have an interesting relationship with Apple right now where there's a percentage-rent and there's a fixed-rent component. And there will continue to be a fixed-rent component, as well as a percentage-rent component. And it's just -- it's not appropriate to sort of talk about how that's going to work.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's a segue into the broader topic of New York street retail. Your brethren in the REIT sector and the office space are pretty hot and heavy on New York street retail. You got a couple of retail REITs doing it. Is that something that you guys have thought about spending more time on? It's clearly been the hottest part of the New York market the last couple of years.","Owen D. Thomas","Well, we -- I would say, on a stand-alone basis, we haven't spent a lot of time on it. The -- clearly, we own some terrific street level retail as part of our portfolio. And we continue to look at new opportunities in New York, primarily on the development side; a little bit less on the acquisition side. And some of them have retail associated with them. But in terms of a standalone strategy to pursue Street level retail, we're not doing that right now in New York.","Douglas T. Linde","So the only thing I would add, Ross, is that we have 2 large retail opportunities in front of us -- actually, 3. We clearly, if and when FAO Schwartz decides to leave the General Motors Building, there's going to be a major -- a block of space that can be accessed from Fifth Avenue, it can be accessed from 50th Street -- 59th Street, it can be accessed from Madison Avenue. And how we utilize that space, which is currently on 3 stories, will be an interesting opportunity for us to redevelop. The second and third are over on Lexington Avenue. We obviously have the space on the ground floor of 399. John Powers suggested that Citibank would like to keep the branch. How much of that branch they're going to keep and then how you get into that branch and how you might access other space on either Lexington Avenue or on either of the streets is going to be a question. And then the third opportunity is, once upon a time, the retail at 601 Lexington Avenue was sort of the new cool thing in New York City. I mean, I remember going to Conran's way back when in the early '80s. And quite frankly, we think that there's an opportunity to really revitalize the retail at the atrium at Citigroup Center. And so those are sort of the 3 major opportunities that we're going to be looking at, investing capital and opportunity, to really enhance the overall cash flow from -- over the next couple of years.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On the disposition front, can you spend just a minute talking about why a recap of Carnegie Center as opposed to an outright sale, which I know you guys tried to do a little while back. And then on The Avenue in D.C., is this the optimal time to be selling given that the NOI growth [indiscernible] south on that asset?","Owen D. Thomas","Well, let me start with Carnegie Center. I think we debated. We feel that we've had some terrific leasing activity at the property and it is approaching a more stabilized level. I think the occupancy right now at Carnegie Center is in the low 90s. But we still see some upside in the asset. We have development opportunities. We're doing a build to suit right now for NRG, as you know. So we thought, perhaps an ideal result would be to do a leveraged recap, possibly with a partner. We're very pleased with our management there and with the success that we've had with the property. And we found last year, in our Times Square Tower exercise, that we ended up doing that as a joint venture given where we found a lot of strength in the capital market for our assets. So on The Avenue, I think -- as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we don't know the answer to your question yet. Clearly, the execution that we're currently working on we think is attractive and it fits into the categories of the assets that we're selling. But the outcome of that sale is undetermined right now.","Operator","Your next call comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to just touch base -- or go back to the comments on the VC centers, Silicon Valley, Cambridge and more recently, New York. Just wondering if you think there's room for or a need for a fourth center, maybe in D.C., where Vornado is helping seed some tech funds and that kind of thing?","Douglas T. Linde","I would -- I think that we would all be enthusiastic if the brainpower that is concentrated in northern Virginia and the technology-oriented organizations that are in the defense home and security, cyber security, whatever you want to call it, would consider locating portions of their workforce in the district. I think the district would think that will be a wonderful thing, too. I think the interesting thing about D.C. is the commuting patterns and where people are living, and there's got to be a little bit of a change in the concentration of talent into areas that are not \"traditional.\" I don't really want to comment on what Vornado is doing in Crystal City because I -- it's just not where we have any investment. But we clearly would be exceedingly enthusiastic, and Ray has been working with the administration about ways to incentivize some of these companies to be more open to looking in the city through economic incentives that would encourage them to put roots down in the city.","Raymond A. Ritchey","That's kind of the motivation behind our 501 K acquisition, the site, to have a platform where meaningful tech relocations could take place in a location that is consistent with where they try to put their workforce.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And would you be sort of interested in potentially doing some sort of side investments? Simon's also announced some stuff on that front in terms of retail innovation. Just curious if you'd have any interest in helping potentially spur that demand through some investments.","Douglas T. Linde","It's an idea that was in vogue in 2000 and 1999, and we decided that seeking warrants was not a core competency of ours. So I think that it would -- we would struggle to put together a portfolio of -- in the D.C. investments in order to entice tenants to come into a particular part of our D.C. market. I guess anything is possible, but I would not anticipate that it would be a core strategy that we would follow.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to Transbay, I know we spent a lot of time on it. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about some blocks of space expiring in the market overall, in the 2017, '19 time frame. Can you just maybe comment on some of the tenants that might be looking for some larger space in that time frame?","Douglas T. Linde","So I announced -- named the number that are currently in the market today. But between 2017 and -- or 2016 and 2018, I think there is about 6.5 million square feet of lease expirations in high-quality financial district buildings. The majority of them being law firms and traditional [indiscernible] type of organizations. And so, traditionally, those tenants, as their lease expires, look at the marketplace and look at ways to become more efficient, look at the way they're utilizing their space. And more times than not, they choose to sort of change their current location. And that's the sort of market that we, I think, are looking at for some of the smaller blocks of space in Transbay Tower meaning 150,000 square feet and down. Some of the larger requirements that are out there are really, we think, going to be more tech-oriented because those organizations are looking for larger blocks of space and they have growth that can't be met in existing assets.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one last sort of question on the law firm discussion. In terms of densities at 250 West where you signed up a few law firm deals, can you talk about the density there versus sort of the 7- and 8-year-old leases that you have in the portfolio?","Douglas T. Linde","Sure. John, you want to take that one?","John Francis Powers","Sure. Certainly, there's a move towards increased density, and that comes from a couple of reasons. Law libraries are much smaller or nonexistent now. The ratio of support people to attorneys has changed. So it's -- part of it's density, but part of it's just sizing the space to the new characteristics of the law firm. The 2 examples that we have, MoFo and Kaye Scholer, certainly, have increased their density significantly, but certainly not what we see in other places.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, can you talk about what that is in terms of square foot per worker?","John Francis Powers","I don't have the specific numbers for MoFo.","Operator","Your next call comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just quick question on the suburban portfolio. Very meaningful lease-up both in Boston and also Princeton this quarter. Just wanted to get a general sense if that was a quarter-specific, or there's some opportunities you were looking at that just happened to land or whether those markets truly are feeling much better from a demand and also a rental pricing perspective?","Douglas T. Linde","So I think I said in my remarks, Tayo, that the suburban Waltham market is very strong right now. It's probably as close to where it was in sort of the early -- late 2000, 2001 time frame, than it's ever -- than it's been since then. I mean it's -- there is literally not a block of 150,000 square feet of quality space between -- in Lexington or Waltham right now, which means that build to suits are sort of part of the dialogue. And we've seen rents go, in the last 1.5 years, from mid 20s to the low 40s for the best space in the marketplace in those buildings like Bay Colony and Waltham Woods and CityPoint and Wellesley Office Park and Riverside, which are sort of the -- those are the higher quality buildings. And none of those buildings have a block of space that's in excess of probably 40,000 or 50,000 square feet. So that market has just been a consistent stronger market with better demand, and it's really been life sciences companies, some of them coming out of Cambridge and some of them being located in the Waltham-Lexington market and just expanding. Cubist Pharmaceuticals being the most significant of those. In Princeton, the -- I don't think Northern New Jersey, in total, has really had a strong recovery. But we have been the fortunate beneficiary, and we've worked hard at it, to attracting some pharmaceutical companies, particularly foreign pharmaceutical companies, that have gone through some explosive growth, and we did some things to entice them to come to Carnegie Center that have worked out. And so a company like Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, we started out and we gave them 23,000 square feet of, basically, free space for 6 months. And now, they've leased 140,000 square feet and they're talking about leasing another 80,000 square feet of space. So good things happen when you establish a relationship with a great customer and you treat them right. And so we have just been the beneficiary of some really strong organic growth within the Princeton portfolio. And as those companies do well, they become more attractive places for companies that are like them. And so we've seen a significant amount of other foreign pharmaceutical interest in the Princeton, and particularly in the Carnegie Center portfolio, and we don't think that, that is a sort of a quarterly phenomena. We think it's a consistent trend.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then just one more for me. The negative cash mark-to-market on the Boston portfolio in the quarter, I just was hoping I could get some details around that?","Douglas T. Linde","Yes. I think, I said -- maybe you missed it. So we had a lease that was signed in 2010 for 75,000 square feet at 111 Huntington Avenue. If you're curious, the rent went from $78 at the time, to $62.50, but there was a limited amount of tenant improvements and there was no free rent, so no down time. And so it was -- and net effect of it is actually a higher overall rent. But that lease actually landed this quarter so the new rent commenced. And if you pull that out, it goes from a negative 13% to a positive 4%.","Operator","Your next call comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one. Looking at the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion portfolio on Boston that's been discussed as being for sale, and you look at those properties, and you see the pricing that's been discussed and you make adjustments for quality occupancy sub-markets etc. How do you think about that as a comp for your current Boston portfolio? Is it better than what you would've thought, or is it in line with what you would've thought? And if this transaction were to occur, does that make you any more optimistic about some of the potential development projects that you're thinking about in Boston?","Douglas T. Linde","Okay. That's a loaded question. So let me try and answer it without putting my foot [ph] in my mouth. The portfolio that is being sold is a combination of some, what we refer to as the jewels of the portfolio, as well as some more commodity-like real estate. In total, the valuation that they believe they are going to achieve and they very well may achieve it, would, I think, look -- make our portfolio in Boston look like it was being priced -- it's currently being valued at $0.60 to $0.70 on the dollar relative to what those buildings are going to go for. If in fact the buildings do sell for what they are reported to be listed for, then I would hope that the expectations that those landlords have for where they think rents are, are going to go up. And so that will be an indication that there's going to be more incremental pricing pressure in the overall Boston CBD market, as well as Cambridge -- one of the buildings is in Cambridge, which would clearly push rents and, therefore, make development more attractive because you have higher rents and you know what your costs are. And if your return on cost gets to a certain point, you're going to start a development. So I think that's all sort of a positive opportunity for the development activity in our portfolio in Boston which, again, currently is 888 Boylston Street sooner rather than later, and then a 600,000 square foot building plus a low-rise building at North Station. And the other piece which we've alluded to, but really isn't on anyone's radar screen, is that we're working with the city to put some additional towers on top of the, what's referred to as the 100 Clarendon Street garage, which is the site that is adjacent to the John Hancock Tower. But that's off into the future, so you shouldn't be putting that on your paper from a modeling perspective. And then North Station's probably the one that's closest, after 888 Boylston Street, from a timing perspective.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks.","Owen D. Thomas","Mort? Is there any final marks -- remarks you'd like to make? Okay, I guess not. Anyway, thank you, everyone, for your time and attention.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties Conference Call.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. Starting with current results, we just completed an outstanding quarter on virtually all metrics. Our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 above our prior forecast and street consensus, and we increase the mid-point of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.04 as well. We leased 3 million square-feet in the fourth quarter, which is an all time quarterly record in Boston Properties' history.","For all of 2016, we leased 6.4 million square-feet, which is approximately 22% above our long-term annual averages. The most of this leasing will have a positive impact in future quarters, our in service portfolio occupancy is now 90.2%, which is up 60 basis points from the end of the third quarter. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the fourth quarter, up 25% on a gross basis and 39% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. Also in the quarter, we announced several large scale new business wins, including the development of new corporate headquarters for both Akamai and Marriott and control of an important site on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC. And to cap it all off, we announced an increase in our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 or 15%.","Let's move to the economic environment, U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but sluggish. And as you know, recently released initial fourth quarter GDP growth estimates were 1.9%, which brought full year 2016 economic growth to 1.6%. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, 156,000 jobs were created in December and the unemployment rates flat at 4.7%. Though, there has been much written about the positive economic impact of the recent election outcome due to the prospects of increased fiscal spending and general regulatory relaxation, we think it's too early to underwrite such optimism and are taking a wait and see approach.","In the capital markets, the 10 year U.S. treasury has risen, approximately 90 basis points to 2.5% since the end of the third quarter. We anticipate the Fed raising rates more frequently in 2017 with some prospect of further acceleration given the strengthening job picture and possibility of fiscal stimulus. Rate rises will be a headwind for the economy given the upper pressure on the dollar and result negative impact on net exports as we saw in the fourth quarter GDP figures. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, the office markets where we operate remain healthy.","In the CBDs of our four core markets and West LA, net absorption was 1.7 million square-feet for the fourth quarter. And additions to supply were around 0.25 million square-feet. And as a result, the vacancy rate dropped from 8.3% to 8.1%. Acting rents rose approximately 1.6% year-over-year and aggregate construction levels are approximately 3.7% of stock versus an annual historical delivery rate of 2.7%.","Now much has been speculated about a quote Trump bumped to office markets in Washington DC due to increased government activity, and New York City due to financial deregulation. While we see financial tenants more confident as a result of the strong stock market in the fourth quarter and legal and lobbing activity has increased in Washington DC, we believe it is too early to expect to experience broad positive leasing activity as a result of the speculated plans of the executive branching Congress.","In the pride of real-estate market, aggregate transaction volumes were modestly lower in 2016 versus 2015. This was driven by fewer assets in the market and a slowdown in transaction activity after the election as interest rates rose sharply. We continue to believe there's a strong bid for high quality office assets in our core markets as several transactions were completed above replacement costs over the last quarter. Examples are, starting in Cambridge 1 Kendall Square, which is a 655,000 square-foot office and retail complex, sold to a domestic REIT for $1,125 a square-foot and a low 4% cap rate, and that includes value allocated at market value to a related development parcel.","In Washington DC, our partner sold its 70% interest in 500 North Capital, a 231,000 square-feet office building located in the capital district, for just under a $1000 a square foot, a mid fourth cap rate to an offshore high net worth investor. In the Soma district of San Francisco, Foundry 3, a 291,000 square-foot office building sold for $1200 a square foot and a 4.7 cap rate to a U.S. pension advisor. And lastly in, LA 2700 Colorado, which is a 311,000 square-foot office building located essentially directly across the street from our own Colorado center, sold for $1165 a square foot to a corporate user.","Several large asset sales are currently in the market and offshore investors remain active, and we think aggressive. One final note on the environment, there's also been much speculation on changes to the tax code initiated by the new President in Congress. Changes which could impact Boston Properties would be a corporate tax decrease, elimination of tax free exchanges, elimination of the deductibility of interest expense and full expensing of capital cost. While a corporate tax decrease would be beneficial to our customers and the other changes could impact our capital strategy, and we are analyzing various scenarios. We think it's again too early to determine the exact provisions of potential tax reform.","So in summary, though, we're long into an economic recovery by any measure relative to history, we're not overly concerned about a near-term recession, given currently low interest rates and the prospects for fiscal stimulus and tax reforms. We're continuing to execute the capital strategy we've been employing over the last few years, which entails growth through aggressive leasing, selective development of pre-leased projects and target acquisitions of under-leased assets. We will protect the downside by keeping leverage at low levels and financing developments through asset sales and additional debt capacity from our increasing NOI.","Now, let me move to the execution of our capital strategy, and I'll start with acquisitions. Our Washington DC team has two important new business wins this past quarter. First, we were selected as the developer by George Washington University for a site at 2100, Pennsylvania Avenue in close proximity to our very successful 2200, Pennsylvania Avenue project. Subject to securing 480,000 square-feet of entitlements, we'll enter into a long term ground-lease with George Washington University to develop and own a lease-hold interest in the property. This is one of the most attractive development sites in the Washington DC CBD, and we have substantial pre-leasing interest for the project. Entitlements could be completed and development commence in 2019 for a 2022 delivery.","Next, upon conclusion of a highly competitive process we were honored to be awarded the opportunity to develop and own 50% of Marriott's new headquarters development in downtown Bethesda, Maryland in partnership with the local land-owner. The building will be 720,000 square-feet, and subject to entitlements and finalizing a lease agreement, the project will commence in 2018 and be delivered in 2022.","At North Station, you recall we're in the middle of constructing a 385,000 square-foot mixed used building, which will also serve as a podium for separate residential hotel and office towers. This past quarter, we signed a long-term ground lease for the hotel parcel with who will be responsible for funding 100% of the improvements. We anticipate commencing the hotel and residential projects in late 2018, and will await a substantial prelease to commence the office joint venture.","On dispositions, there were no new transactions last quarter. For all of 2016, we completed three deals for total gross proceeds to Boston Properties of $235 million in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. For 2017, we anticipate continuing the selective disposition of non-core assets with projected total gross proceeds in excess of $200 million.","Moving to development, we remain active, delivering assets in the service advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. This past quarter, we delivered in the service 1265 Main Street, headquarters for Clarks in suburban Boston, which I described in detail last quarter. In terms of starts for the fourth quarter, in the Boston region, we've commenced the full redevelopment of 191 Spring Street, a 160,000 square-foot vacant building in Lexington and a new retail amenity building on the Plaza outside of 100 Federal Street. Our total investments in these projects in $85 million, and both are further examples of opportunities we have in our portfolio to profitability reposition assets and create additional amenities for our customers.","We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from the third quarter include, we signed a letter of intent with our land partner for MacArthur Transit Village, which is a 402 unit residential project located in Oakland, California; whereupon full entitlement of the site, we have the right to develop and invest in the project on favorable term. This development would commence in 2018 and deliver in 2020. We also received site plan approval for the development of Akamai\u2019s 475,000 square-foot headquarters at Kendall Center in Cambridge. This project will start this year, and be delivered in 2020.","At the end of the fourth quarter, our development pipeline consists of seven new projects and three redevelopments, totaling 4 million square-feet and $2.3 billion of projected cost. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% with material preleasing. In the aggregate, these projects are a significant growth driver for us over the next three years.","So, to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for growth and creating shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. In our third quarter investor materials, we provided a roadmap to shareholders of our clear and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020, by delivering our current development pipeline on-time and budget and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And this growth profile excludes most of the new business wins I described earlier; the opportunity supported by our significant land banks and new opportunities that could be identified and executed upon, given our conservative leverage and strong balance sheet.","So with that, let me turn it over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody, Happy New Year. Consistent with Owen's remarks on the performance of the overall U.S. economy, as we begin 2017, I think about our own projections for the year where our view is that the overall health of the office markets really isn\u2019t going to change too much from what we experienced over the last 12 months.","We continue to see the bulk of office demand growth from the technology and the life sciences businesses, and pretty steady as we go from financial services and other traditional users. While, there is no question that venture capital investing slowed across industry types and regions in '16, there was still $70 billion invested, which is more than double what was invested in 2006 to put in perspective. And interestingly, there was more capital raise by the DC sponsors in '16 and in any year since 2006. So, there is a lot of money sitting on the side lines waiting to be invested.","Demand from traditional office tenants and legal and the large financial services, has stabilized. While there are still sporadic space reductions stemming from changes in utilization and some downsizing, we have begun to see pockets of growth from these tenants in New York, and in San Francisco and in Boston. For instance, the new lease that was signed by Point72 who is currently in our building at 510 Madison with 2022 lease expiration is significantly larger when they moved to the Hudson Yard.","In our portfolio we had 40,000 square foot hedge fund extend by more than 50% in our New York City portfolio. Accenture, which is tenant in Boston, is going to move into 888 Boylston Street and they are going to expand by more than almost 50% later this year. We have 45,000 square-feet private equity firm at the Prudential Center, and expanded by 10,000 square-feet. So, lots of examples of traditional tenants starting to feel better about their business and moving forward. New supply, however, has been delivered in all of our markets and along with the organic supply from the more efficient use of space at the last number of years, It still continues to impact the markets, particularly older buildings that don\u2019t want to reinvest new capital.","Before describe the various market dynamics, I do want to reiterate the phenomenal quarter our teams produced from an operating perspective. 3 million square-feet of leasing is a big deal. We completed 112 transactions, typical quarter about 80, so that\u2019s about 40% more. And actively Akamai lease of 4 76,000 square-feet, the next largest transaction was only 200,000 square feet. Our same store results were positive across all the regions. On a net basis, San Francisco was up 76%, Boston was up 24%, the New York City office portfolio was up 14%, and DC was up a little less than 1%. Our operating platform continues to be, if not are, probably the critical strategic differentiator for this organization.","I\u2019ll start my regional comments with San Francisco. Last quarter and at the NAREIT Conference in November, we were responded to questions about sublet space and the resiliency of the technology tenant demand. There is no question that sublet space interfered with direct space leasing in '16. But as I described on our last call, each major block was quickly leased. Currently, the largest block of sublet space is about 80,000 square-feet, and there are only three pieces of space in access of 50,000 square-feet available on the sublet market and their average termites under two years. The majority of the sublet space in San Francisco is in units under 20,000 square-feet.","And with regard to technology demand, just during the fourth quarter; Twitch, which is an Amazon subsidiary, completed 185,000 square foot lease at 350 Bush; Adobe is up 200,000 square-feet; Slack announced their 230,000 square-feet lease at 500 Howard. And by the way, they were an 11,000 square-feet tenant at 680 Fulsome Street our buildings two years ago. And last month a start-up called Blend took 50,000 square-feet at 500 Prime.","On Friday, however, there was yet another article in the San Francisco Media, noting with concern that the near-term deliveries, including Salesforce Tower are an issue and how they might impact the market. While we can tell you, we signed 40,000 square-feet of leases in December, and we are completing the drafting of 100,000 square foot, four-floor lease that we expect to execute in the next few weeks with a tenant that needs late 2017 occupancy. With this commitment, we will have leased almost 1 million square feet at Salesforce Tower. This will bring us to 68% leased with 450,000 square-feet of availability.","Tour activity is consistently strong, and we have begun marketing to partial floor users with occupancies as early as the fourth quarter of 2017. When we talk to the brokers\u2019 community about their tenants in the market left, which they all maintain, there continue to be a number of 200,000 square foot prospects tech and traditional active in the San Francisco CBD market. At the moment, there aren't any blockbuster requirements those 500,000 square footers that we saw in '14 and '15, which is very similar to this experience we saw last year. But the overall market conditions, we've been describing for the last few quarters, remain the same.","Each quarter there continues to be a new crop of technology company requirements in addition to the traditional lease expiration driven market. We think the real news in San Francisco is simply the stability of the markets. In West LA, we signed leases for more than 200,000 of our 350,000 square-feet of office availability at Colorado Center. And we extended another 190,000 square foot tenant. We have a number of discussions ongoing on the two final pieces of the base, one 40,000 and the other one's about 70,000. The purchase of 2700 Colorado by Oracle and their expected growth in that building has accelerated the tightening of the market in the immediate sub-area. Amazon, Snap, Oracle, Rightgames and Hulu all expanded in the sub-market during the quarter.","We've completed the initial planning for our upgrade of the common areas, and we are moving into the execution phase on that plan. I want to start my discussion in the New York City region with the General Motors\u2019 building where we've been very successful marketing the floors that we got back last July, the 33rd and 34th floors, we're asking above $170 a square foot in rent. We've leased 23,000 square-feet, have a lease-out for 40,000 square-feet and there\u2019re exchange proposals for the remaining prebuilt suite.","During this process, we found a number of tenants that want to be in the building but would prefer a lower price alternative, which we could provide lower in the building if we had available space. With that in mind, we've agreed to take back two lower floors from an existing tenant. That tenant lease expiration is in late 2020, and we reached an agreement to terminate the lease in exchange for a significant payment. While we are taking some risk on the lease-up, we feel confident we will lease the space at rents comparable to the expiring rent and have reduced our 2020 exposure at the building.","We have also concluded all the leasing on the retail space on 5th Avenue with an expansion and extension with Apple, that mystery tenant we've been talking about for over a year. They will grow from 32,000 square-feet to more than 77,000 square-feet. And while they are undertaking their expansion, they are using the former FAO Schwarz lease on a temporary basis. This interim store is open, and they expect to reoccupy the renovated space in late '18 at which time we will deliver this interim store to Under Armor for their full build-out.","The conditions we've been describing for the last few years in New York City still remain in control. We are not anticipating office run growth and we do expect higher concessions versus 2016 across midtown in '17. New supply continues to come into the market in the form of new deliveries and large blocks of space return to the market in buildings like 4 Times Square and 65 East 55th, or 1271 6th Avenue and soon 399 Park Avenue impact the market. Landlords that are putting capital into all their assets are attracting tenants, Major League Baseball went over to 1271 6th Avenue, and space that is attractively priced is also getting activity. In the latter part of '16, 270,000 square-feet of space was leased to three tenants at the base to 4 Times Square, the space Conde Nast moved out when they moved down to the World Trade Center.","Our total New York regional office leasing activity in the fourth quarter was about 400,000 square feet. In addition to the lease at the General Motor's building, we completed two full floor deals at 599 Lexington Avenue and 240,000 square-feet at Carnegie Center. We\u2019re starting rents of between $32 and $35 a square foot, and TIs are running between $0 and $6 per square foot per year. 159 East 53rd Street is under demolition and we've had lots of tour activity as the building has never been on the tenant reps radar since it's been occupied by Citi Bank since the building opened in the late 70s -- early 70s. We are marketing a brand new building with a greatly enhanced window line, brand new mechanical plan and tremendous outdoor space on each floor. We hope to deliver this 195,000 square-feet block to tenants in 2018 with revenue commencing in 2019.","At 399 Park, our repositioning activities are accelerating, and we are offering products at various pricing levels from the mid-80s at the base to over $140 a square foot for our Oasis glass block with its 13 foot finish ceiling height on the 14th floor. ","The DC Central Business District office market fundamentals really haven't seen any demonstrative positive change since election. In fact, one of the recent executive orders putting a higher increase on significant portions of the federal government is probably unlikely to spur new GSA requirements. Landlords are still competing pretty seriously on available space and congestions in the DC are pretty strong, 10 years or more leases are getting 12 months of free rent and at least $100 square foot of tenant improvement allowances.","DC is truly a forward leasing market for any sizeable space, and we're in active discussions with our new opportunity at 2100 Penn as Owen mentioned. With the right products and the right locations, you can break away from the commodity leasing market and make a lot of money in D.C. There continues to be specula buildings under construction, ageing buildings are being repositioned and there're still lots of buildings with over 100,000 square-feet of space, but again you can still make money in DC.","This quarter, our most significant DC lease was 10 year renewal with the GSA at 500 East Street for over 200,000 square-feet. The one area in the DC region where we've seen the potential for pick-up in activity is around the defense and the intelligent users in Northern Virginia. Activity at our VA 95 single storey product, which is adjacent to Fort Boulevard has accelerated significantly, and we're on lease negotiations with two tenants one for 53,000 square feet and the other for 69,000 square feet.","And finally, I want to describe the pending development in Bethesda. Marriott is leasing 100% of the office space we're not involved in the hotel that\u2019s also part of that development. And when the building is completed in 2022, the building will be 100% leased. It's premature however to discuss any of the financial details. So, if you ask any questions, you're not going to get a very satisfactory answer from us this quarter.","In Boston, as Owen reported, we completed our lease with Akamai on the site of our existing 79,000 square foot 145 Broadway building. With the recent news of MIT's acquisition of the Volpe site for $750 million, I think it's fair to say that the new Akamai lease that we signed this quarter is already well below market. Our Cambridge portfolio was 98% leased. A few quarters ago, I described the possible opportunity to recapture the Microsoft base at 455 Main Street. This Microsoft consolidated into an adjacent building in Cambridge. Well, it happened and we\u2019re getting 100,000 square-feet back on December 31st of this year and the current rent is $50 gross.","Across the river in the Backbay, we had a very active quarter. We leased 64,000 square-feet at 888, Boylston Street, bringing the office building to 89% leased. We leased 200,000 square-feet at the Prudential Center. We did 55,000 square-feet at 120 St. James, and 33,000 square-feet at 200 Clarendon. Activity at 120 St. James is robust, and we are in lease negotiations on the majority of an additional floor, and have four active letter of intent negotiations ongoing right now for the remaining space.","We\u2019ve introduced our plans to create high-end pre-build sweets at 200 Clarendon, and have seen a meaningful pick-up and interest on that space as well. While the Boston CBD continues to be predominantly a lease expiration driven market, during the steady flow of new market entrance as well as some growing technology companies. This quarter Reebok announced the decision to move into the city, and the interest we are seeing for the 175,000 square-feet of office base at the first space of the hub, which is under construction, and will be delivered by the second quarter of 2019 has exceeded our expectations.","The pace of activity in our suburban portfolio was equally strong during the fourth quarter. We completed more than 300,000 square-feet of leasing, including adding another life science firm to the portfolio with 46,000 square-foot lease at 140 Kender Street, which brings that building to 100% leased. We commenced the redevelopment of 191 Spring Street and are in negotiation for an 80,000 square-foot lease tenant, which we expect to have in place before the end of the fourth quarter of '17. High quality space is at a premium in the Boston suburbs.","So, going back to our bridges, in November, we published a slide-deck which included an update on how to think about our growth over the next 36 months, which is what Owen was describing. The first slide illustrated the incremental share of NOI, we believe we could achieve through an increase in occupancy from our high contribution buildings. The total incremental contribution was projected to be about $111 million. To-date, we\u2019ve signed leases where we have not yet began recognizing revenue totaling $56 million, and about $22 million of that will start to hit the books in 2017.","The second slide illustrated the map of a ramp-up of our income from our development investments. We showed meaningful additions to our lease-up of these assets this quarter, including the 475,000 square-foot pre-leased of Akamai, 64,000 square-feet at 888 Boylston Street, 40,000 at Salesforce with that other 100,000 square-feet coming on in the very near future. We are progressing on completing the leasing of our development assets necessary to generate the incremental run-rate of $234 million of NOI annually by the beginning of 2020.","And with that, I\u2019ll let Mike talk about this quarter.","Mike LaBelle","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I am going to start with a few comments on capital raising this morning. As Owen described, we have strong opportunities to continue to expand our development pipeline, and we\u2019ve active in the capital markets, considering funding options for that. As we\u2019ve discussed before, with our relatively low leverage, particularly if you calculated on a pro forma basis for the delivery of our developments, we do not anticipate raising public equity. And we expect to focus our capital raising activities on the debt markets and moderate asset sales.","This quarter, we raised an incremental $200 million. This included the closing of $250 million construction loan from a consortium of banks for our Brooklyn Navy Yard development and $40 million 15 year mortgage on our recently delivered new development at 1265 Main Street in Waltham. We own 50% of each of these projects, so our share of the proceeds will be $145 million. We also closed on the partial sale of Metropolitan Square in Washington DC where we\u2019ve reduced our interest from 51% to 20%, and raised net proceeds of $58 million. Our current pipeline has approximately $1 billion to fund through the end of 2019. And in addition to using our available cash balances, we expect to be active in the debt markets in 2017 raising additional capital.","Our earnings guidance assumes that we utilize our untapped line of credit to fund the incremental development cost. But it is likely that we put in place additional debt facilities during the year, which could increase our interest expense guidance depending on timing.","So, turning to our earnings for the quarter, we had a strong quarter, and we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for FFO by $0.04 per share or about $7 million. The portfolio beat expectations by about $4 million of this through a combination of earlier than projected leasing wins and lower than anticipated utility acceptance. As both Doug and Owen described, we had a strong quarter of leasing, including early renewal activity that had rental rate increases in suburban Boston, at Colorado Center, in West LA, and at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco that increased our revenue for the quarter.","We also earned about $4 million higher fee income than we expected for the quarter. A portion of this emanated from higher utilization of services across the portfolio that included a substantial amount of overtime HVACs in New York City, which demonstrated growing economic activity at our clients there. We also generated nearly $2 million in leasing commissions at a property that we manage on a fee basis. As Owen mentioned this quarter, we closed a long-term Air Rights lease with a hotel operator who is going to build 270-room hotel at our hub on Causeway development in Boston. We will provide development and management services to the project over the next three years, and we commenced earning development fees this quarter, which was a little bit earlier than we projected.","And lastly, we incurred $1.2 million of debt deal related expenses that we had not budgeted, which partially offset the gains from fee income in the portfolio. Our FFO run rate from third quarter to fourth quarter is up significantly by $0.12 a share. About $0.05 of this is from seasonality and our operating expenses and above normal fee income, but a substantial portion relates to growth in our revenue base, as well as well as lower interest expense from the refinancing activity that we completed in the third quarter. Our revenue run rate is higher by about $0.05 per share from increases in occupancy and rolling-up of rents on leasing activity with strong contributions at the Prudential Center in Boston, our suburban Boston portfolio and Embarcadero Center.","As we look forward to 2017, we have increased our guidance for 2017 funds from operations by $0.04 per share at the midpoint from last quarter. A strong fourth quarter leasing success includes a number of new leases and renewals that will start to enhance our revenues in 2017. The deal activity in Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco will have the most significant impact. And in Boston, this includes significant leases at Prudential Tower at 120 St. James, Kendall Center and multiple leases in our Waltham portfolio.","We're continuing to see strong activity on the remaining 115,000 square-feet of availability that we have at 120 St. James where we could see incremental income in 2017, and certainly by 2018. The leasing of the 190,000 square-feet of high value availability in the mid and high rise at 200 Clarendon Street is unlikely to generate significant revenue until 2018. The successful leasing of over 400,000 square-feet of new and renewal leases that Doug described at Colorado Center is also resulting in growth in our 2017 revenue. We have 150,000 square-feet of remaining vacancy where we project modest revenue towards the end of 2017 and more meaningful contribution in 2018.","The leasing in the New York City portfolio was mostly renewal activity, and new leases geared towards 2018 rent commencements. As Doug mentioned, we entered into a termination with a 75,000 square-foot tenant in the GM building. This transaction results in approximately $0.03 per share of additional income in 2017, which is the net impact of our share of the termination payment, offset by the loss of cash rent for the remainder of 2017. We will be reclassifying recurring income to termination income, which moves it out of our same property projections.","With the pickup in portfolio leasing elsewhere, we are not changing our assumptions for growth in our share of combined 2017 same property NOI of 2% to 3.5% from last year. However, for cash same property NOI, we are moderating our assumptions for growth by 50 basis points to 1.5% to 3.5%. We project temporarily losing cash income at the GM building, while gaining straight-line rent across the portfolio from new leases that have free rent periods at inception.","Our projections now assume non-cash straight-line rent of $55 million to $80 million in 2017. This quarter, we added the 191 Spring Street redevelopment to our development pipeline, the 160,000 square-foot building in suburban Boston will undergo $53 million renovation, including leasing costs. The project also includes approximately $3 million of demolition costs that we expect to expense in 2017. To account for these expenses, we've reduced our projections for the contribution from the non-same property portfolio to $18 million to $25 million. The only other meaningful change to our 2017 guidance this quarter is related to development and management services income where we increased our guidance range from $27 million to $33 million.","In conclusion, we're increasing our 2017 projected FFO guidance range to $6.13 to $6.23 per share, an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint. The increase is projected to be driven by $0.03 per share from the net impact of lease termination, $0.02 per share of improved portfolio performance and $0.02 per share from fee income, offset by $0.02 per share of higher demolition expenses and $0.01 per share of higher G&A expense. Our 2016 results includes $58 million or $0.34 per share of termination income. This is much higher than our current assumption for 2017 of $16 million to $18 million. Adjusting for the impact of the change in termination income from year-to-year, we're projecting strong FFO growth of nearly 8% in 2017. And as a result of our growth from our 2016 performance, we also increased our dividend in the fourth quarter by over 15% to an annual rate of $3 per share.","That completes our formal remarks. Operator if you want to open the line for questions if you can?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Doug, question for you. You went through -- the market as we typically do, the one question I have walking away from that is if you took DC specifically as a market, how do you feel about DC, especially CBD today versus a year ago, because I couldn\u2019t kind of place where your mood was on that?","Owen Thomas","I\u2019ll give you my reaction, and then I\u2019ll let Ray give his comments. My view is nothing has changed in DC proper. We\u2019ve seen a market that is forward in terms of its leasing, and there are basically very few large transactions that are going to hit in 2017, '18 or '19 that are impacting those years in terms of rental rates. So all the leasing is forward. And so, if you have a block of available space today, it's going to be hand-to-hand combat, as Ray like to say in terms of getting that lease that\u2019s basically. And there is new suppliers coming online, and there are tenants in significant -- or landlords that are significantly improving their quote-on-quote edging beauties with new capital. So, it's a very competitive market for second generation space, and there is not a lot of new demand generators in the district itself. Ray, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts.","Ray Ritchey","Well, this will come as a shock, but I have a little more optimistic viewpoint to Doug. I would agree with Doug. The market is bifurcated between the traditional as we call edging beauties the buildings that have been that represent the A Class buildings for many, many years, but has being a little bit more challenged. But it is amazing to us, the demand for high level, trophy level space, new construction and thus showing the success we had 61 Mass and the interest we\u2019re receiving at 2100 Penn. We\u2019ve had control of the property now for two or three months, and we\u2019ve got three or four major law firms that we\u2019re in active discussions in. Even though that occupancy will take place in '21 and '22. So it's a very, very differentiated market, high-end trophy space, as strong as ever.","The space has been kind of bypass because of new technology, new configuration and new locations, is facing some challenges. But we are still very, very optimistic. We think the law firm consolidation has been running at full course. There is one dynamic of the Trump is we\u2019re seeing a lot of associations, corporations, others engaging law firm and lobbies to understand what the Trump dynamic will mean. So, we are seeing -- and as Doug referred in the call, we\u2019re seeing an uptick just in the last month or so in the defense and intelligence related community demand. So, one maybe view the glass half full, I view as the glass almost due to the top. We\u2019re feeling very good about the upper in space.","Owen Thomas","So, Manny, I actually think our comments are pretty consistent. So, when we referred to 2100 Penn you talking about leases that are commenced in 2022. It's a forward leasing market, and we\u2019re very encouraged about how we\u2019ll do at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we have available space in '17, '18, '19, you\u2019re going to struggle.","Manny Korchman","And maybe just second from me, was there anything specific driving the large leasing volumes in the fourth quarter that will slow with just a lot of walking tackling, What's the favorite going forward on just leasing volumes looking at the first half of '17 specifically?","Ray Ritchey","Let me say one thing and then I\u2019ll let Owen comment. There was not one deal that was done during that period that was originated during the fourth quarter. So, everything is ongoing. And I would say that to the extent that things were getting done it was because it was the end of the year and people want to get paid on the brokerage side. And there's an emphasis on getting deals completed. I would also say that there was more confidence in the business community after the results of the election, and that probably you know pushed things further along quicker than they might otherwise have been.","Owen Thomas","No, I think that's all right. There were a -- like the Akamai was a lumpy lease, obviously. As much as I\u2019d love to think $3 million would be a run rate quarterly leasing volume for us, that's not going to be the case. It was an extraordinary quarter, and there were some special circumstances, but the markets remained healthy. And I think the other thing that happened is I'm very proud and pleased with our leasing professionals around the Company. I think they very much focused on our goals for the year, and performed accordingly. So, starting with the combination of all these factors a healthy market, some lumpy leases and focused execution by our team.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","You guys had a pretty good pick-up in occupancy, and you're now back over 90% portfolio-wide, as you talked about. Do you guys track that on a percent lease basis, if you include leases that haven't, that have been signed but not commenced? I am just trying to get a feel for how that number might be trending following the really good quarter of leasing?","Michael LaBelle","We don't -- we can figure out the numbers we have. We can look at and we know specific situations where we have you know large tenants, for example, at 250, West 51st Street. We have an 85,000 square foot tenant that hasn't taken occupancy yet. We have 25,000 square foot tenant at GM building that hasn't taken occupancy yet. We have some tenants across the portfolio where we think about distinct situations where we can look at it. We've not aggregated that and looked at it on a forward basis.","We do obviously look at what our occupancy is going to be over the next couple of years. And our view for this year is that we\u2019re still going to average between 90 and 91%. Our occupancy should go up in the first couple of quarters. And then at the end of the year, we\u2019re going to lose occupancy at 399 Park Avenue in New York City, which is going to bring it back down a little bit.","And as Doug described in his notes and what we\u2019ve disclosed in our investor presentations are that, look, we've got some vacancy in some buildings like 200, Clarendon Street, Colorado Center, 601 Lex, where we believe we're going to fill these spaces up. We're highly confident we're going to fill these spaces up over the next couple of years, and move our occupancy up into the 93% area.","Jed Reagan","And just I guess sticking with you, Mike, you mentioned some of the debt activities you're exploring as you\u2019re looking to fund development. Just order of magnitude, curious how much incremental debt you might be looking to issue this year. And where you think your debt to EBITDA might finish the year versus where we're sitting today?","Michael LaBelle","On a net debt to EBITDA basis, I would say that we still believe that we\u2019re going to be kind of ranging somewhere to the low 6s to 7s. And then when the income starts coming in as we deliver developments, it's going to come down. The capital that we're going to be raising, if you look at the outflows, we've got $1 billion worth of outflows over the next couple of years. I would anticipate, in 2017, we're going to need to raise somewhere in the $500 million to $700 million area to fund what's happening in 2017. Fund the development outflows that we've going something in that zip code.","Owen Thomas","And Jed, I think the way to think about it is, if you think about our development outflows, as Mike described, that's the money that we're going to spend, we will probably raise more than that. A lot of it will be in the form of either term loans that can be drawn down upon or our line of credit, enhancing it in terms of size. So a lot of the capacity may not actually be dollars that are sitting on our balance sheet, they just maybe availability of dollars that we have.","Jed Reagan","And just to clarify Mike, you mentioned the low 6 to 7 range on debt-to-EBITDA. What -- just how does that compare to your spot debt-to-EBITDA at 1231 on your numbers?","Michael LaBelle","We\u2019re in the low 6 of that, I believe 6.4 or something like that, I believe.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Great, thank you.","Michael LaBelle","That's moved up a little bit as the development fundings occur, because we don\u2019t have the cash coming in. So, as you fast forward to the cash income coming in from those developments, it's going to come down significantly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just a few questions here, first, just in reference to Doug, I think you said flattish leasing market here in New York, and you referenced the demand from more lower floors in the GM building. As you guys look at your availability here in New York, how much of it would you say is in that value sweet spot, call it, whatever $80, $90 under $100 a foot versus how much is in the over $100 foot?","Owen Thomas","I'll take it a stab at that and then John Powers you can correct me if you think I'm misstating it. So, the biggest bulk of our quote-on-quote value space defined as you just described it is, 100% of the space at 1590 53rd Street, so that's a 195,000 square feet and probably 200,000 plus square feet of the space at 399, so call it 400,000 square foot and then we have 300,000 plus square feet of space at 399 that would be in excess of that. And we have 50,000 square foot of space at the top of 250 West 55th Street that would be above that number. And these two floors that we're getting back from a tenant at General Motors\u2019 building would still be well in excess of that $90 plus square-foot. John, am I missing anything?","John Powers","No, I think that's it, probably half and half.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, John, so half is in the sweet spot half is in the elevated numbers, right?","John Powers","Well, you say the sweet spot. I think Doug is using your terminologies, under 100 and over a 100.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, what would you term -- so how should we think about it when we hear from the brokers that hey it's a competitive market, tenants have a lot of choice. But it sounds like you guys had good activity with certain spots, rent spots in the market?","John Powers","Yes, every product is a little different. If you look at 159, that's a very unique offering. It's almost a new building, and it's going to be spectacular, it's got a lot of outdoor space. So, I'd say that is very much in the sweet spot of the market, because that will be priced under $100. But we have space at 399, in the tower there that is sweet spot, and now it's 25,000 foot for the core that's a great building. So although be below that's over a 100, it's not a 150. And so people that are looking for high quality might find that to be their sweet spot.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second part is you mentioned the need to spend on buildings here in New York, or maybe even in DC to attract the tenants and get the tenants. How do you guys separate out spend that\u2019s basically just necessary to get the tenants to come in versus spend that you\u2019re getting in incremental return on the investment?","Michael LaBelle","So, we\u2019ve talked about this before and there are two ways to think about this, Alex. So, the first way to think about this is either investment that we\u2019re making that actually have an incremental NOI contribution. And so, what we do is we think about our buildings and we say if we don\u2019t do anything what can we rent the space for and how long might it take. And if we do something what will be the rent be and how long might it take. And in many cases, we actually think that additional capital is going to both enhance the rent that we\u2019re achieving and reduce the downtime that we\u2019re achieving.","There are also incremental investments that we\u2019re making in these buildings. We\u2019re actually achieving additional income. So, as an example at 601 Lexington Avenue, there is a -- that first instance, we think we\u2019re going to achieve 7% to 12% return on our capital, because we\u2019re going to get a significantly higher rent than we would have otherwise gotten have we simply leased the space as is. And we\u2019re also redoing the retail space and we\u2019re going to get incremental revenue on the retail space. But what we said is the return on the retail space really is about for the building. And so will that retail space reinvestment improve our ability to generate higher return, aka higher rents from the rest of the space at 601, and we think that\u2019s in fact the case.","And given the amount of the investment, you don\u2019t have to get more than a buck or two in order to have a pretty significant return. So, we\u2019ve got how we think about these things. Now there are other situations where we\u2019re doing a lobby or where we having to replace an edging window system or the elevators need to go from a called to a destination. Those types of improvements are much harder to quantify in terms of a dramatic change in the overall environment of the building and there when I referred to more sort of recurring capital investments that are critical not revenue producing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Doug, I guess, maybe you could talk a little bit about your Brooklyn project, and the demand that you\u2019re seeing for that development?","Owen Thomas","John, that one is for you.","John Powers","Okay. Well, we\u2019re very excited about the projects. And this is a big days for us, because the first piece of scale went up this morning. So, we\u2019re rolling along. There is no -- the buildings built all above grade, so there is no foundation. So, the building will spectacular. It's got all the amenities of a new building, floor-to-floor heights, et cetera. And we\u2019re working with the Navy Yard and the transportation side. I think it's a little too early for the leasing. We brought it out to the brokerage community, and I think it's going to well receive.","Steve Sakwa","I mean, John, can you just maybe talk a little bit about what the tenants were saying? I know transportation is a bit balanced there. So, what are you sort of facing or hearing from them?","John Powers","Well, in the -- look, the first part of this is going out to the brokerage community overall. And I think we\u2019ve done that pretty successfully. We have to get closer to the date when the building is done to talk to specific tenants.","Steve Sakwa","I guess transitioning maybe to the West-Coast, Doug. Maybe talk a little bit about the search for a senior executive and run that region. And just what are the other opportunities that you\u2019re may be seeing in the marketplace today, because it sounds like you're making good progress on the leasing front of the vacant space. So what other opportunities have you sort of found or uncovered?","Owen Thomas","So, Steve it's Owen. We are off to a great start in California. We bought Colorado Center, as you know, last year with 66-67% leased. We've leased I think two-thirds of the vacancy and have good activity on the balance. And we have a comparable sale across the street that's well in excess of the basis that we paid for the building. So, we're in a new market, an important market, we think long-term for the Company and we're in there on a profitable basis. And I think, operationally, the asset has been seamlessly integrated into Boston Properties. And Ray Ritchey has done a wonderful job overseeing the leasing and repositioning of the assets.","So, your question is where do we go from here? We are going to hire this year a regional head for Los Angeles. We're conducting an outside search, and we're also considering internal candidates for this spot. So, that'll be an important internal step. ","In terms of deals, one of the attractiveness of the West LA market where we intend be active is development is difficult, entitlements are hard to come by, it preserves value. And therefore, it is harder to grow. That being said, I would say we have a bead on, I would say at this point, something like half a dozen different opportunities, some of them are sales of under-leased buildings, some are repositioning of existing assets and some are development.","As we said before, we're delighted to be in LA. We're going to grow overtime. We want to be a leading land lord and developer in the market, but we also are pushing pressure on ourselves to do that overnight. We want to continue to do it the way we did with Colorado Center and do it on a profitable basis. And I\u2019m hopeful this year that we'll be able to add at least one other asset to our portfolio. And if we can find something on a basis that makes sense financially for shareholders, we're going to do that.","Steve Sakwa","And then just last question, I guess, the new retail has opened at the Prudential Center. Doug, I don't know if this is for you or someone else. So, maybe just talk about how that's performing and then the feeder that\u2019s been maybe for the office and what demand that's been for office tenants into the Backbay?","Owen Thomas","Sure .So for those of you who are unfamiliar with what's going on at the Prudential Center. When we built the 88, Boylston Street at the same time, we basically demolished what was the Food Court, reinvented it as a 45,000 square foot Eataly and also added another floor space to a portion of the Prudential Center, which we refer to as the flagship. All of that space is leased, and Under Armor, Eataly, organization called Aritzia, the floor expanded. We've got a whole new roster of tenants.","And based upon the foot traffic, particularly in what we referred to as the slower times, the Eataly has really been a very positive revenue enhancer to the Prudential Center, and it\u2019s driving traffic not just from a retail perspective but actually it's been driving traffic from a parking perspective. So we actually have a lot of visitors that are coming to the Prudential Center parking and paying for a couple of hours of parking as well, which is important.","We have a couple or more of these types of opportunities in front of us. But I think the relevancy of the Prudential retail is stronger today than it has ever been. It's a place that people want to come, and I think it has generated a buzz amongst the retailers so that other retailers want to be here as well. And so, we're feeling really-really good about our incremental investments there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Maybe for Doug, you guys obviously had very healthy rent spreads on the 650,000 square-feet of commenced 2nd gen leases during the quarter, up 25% on a gross basis. But can you talk a little bit about maybe what the spreads look like on the 2nd gen leases executed during the quarter? And what should we expect for rent spreads throughout 2017?","Michael LaBelle","I'm going to be honest with you. On 3 million square-feet of space and we didn't calculate the number on the step that was executed this quarter. In general, what we are seeing is that our San Francisco area leases are leases that are less than -- more than five years, generally are somewhere between 40% and 50% on a gross basis, doing upwards of 70% on a net basis. Our rents in New York City typically are up 5% to 7% or flat. And we talked about this before, there're certain buildings, 399 being the best example, where we're basically going to be working hard to maintain the same rent level that we had on a basis prior to their expirations.","On the other hand, in a building like General Motors\u2019 building, we were taking space back at $100 plus a square foot and leasing it at a $150 square foot. We're seeing a very significant uptick. So, it's very much depending upon the space. Washington DC we have the -- the fortunate or the unfortunate circumstance of having leases in that market that are going up annually by 3% plus a year. So in general, when a lease rolls over in Washington DC, it's probably at market or slightly above market.","And so that's why I think you see, in general, a pretty moderate roll-up or roll-down in Washington DC overtime. And then in Boston, again, I think you're seeing a pretty consistent growth in rents. Anything in Cambridge is probably 100% on a net basis, anything in the Backbay is probably somewhere between 25% and 35% on a net basis, and in the suburbs are between 10% and 15%, because we're generally rolling rents from them, mid-to-high 30s to the low-40s.","Blaine Heck","So, just as a follow-up to that, it looks like roughly half of your expirations are in New York in 2017. So is it fair to say we should see that spread moderate as we go through?","Michael LaBelle","Yes. As I said, the majority of that expiration in New York City in 2017 is at 399 Park, which I just referred to and it's a pretty flat expiration. I think I said in the past that net-net we're a couple of bucks of square foot on average when we lease all that space up above where we're currently expiring.","Blaine Heck","And then Mike a little bit more granular question, it looks like cash same-store NOI and your share is going to boost this quarter from the year-over-year change in straight line ground rent expense. Can you just explain what's going on there, and whether you expect that to continue to be a tailwind going forward?","Michael LaBelle","This is an interesting situation actually, so I'm glad you brought it up. At the Backbay Station garage, so we own the garage. We extended the ground lease on that garage when we got the additional rights to develop over Backbay station. And what we did is we agreed to pay $37 million in ground rent, and straight lined it over a 99 year ground lease term. The payments associated with that go out as we improve the station, so as the dollar go out. So in the fourth quarter of 2015, we spent $5 million improving some installation there, and in fourth quarter of '16 we spent very little, so that was a boost to our casting store from '15 to '16.","We are dependent upon the budgeting of the MBTA to figure out when these costs are going to out, so they are hard for us to judge. But I would say, over the next two to three years, we could have some lumpy quarters where some of this all the sudden hits. In 2017, we don\u2019t have a significant amount of expectation, because again they are planning, it has been a little bit slower. So, we don\u2019t have a strong projection as to the exact timing, so we do not expect much to go on in 2017.","Blaine Heck","So none of that tailwind is incorporated in guidance?","Michael LaBelle","No, I mean if anything, it's is going to be a headwind in the quarters when we have these dollars, and we\u2019ll have to explain it in that quarter, because it's really kind of an unusual thing.","Blaine Heck","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Michael LaBelle","We\u2019re pre-paying ground rent that we\u2019re straight-lining over 99 years.","Blaine Heck","Right.","Michael LaBelle","So we will point it out when it happens so that people understand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","I guess, just going back to Ray, can you talk more about what you\u2019re seeing in the suburb, you guys gave a lot of color on CBD. But it seems like you had some traction on leasing. And then just kind of bigger picture as we\u2019re sitting here this time next year, what do you think it's going to go different in DC?","Ray Ritchey","Again, I think like downtown, the suburbs are sub-market by sub-market, western still remains very strong. We got less than a 3% vacancy and strong demand there. Tysons seems to be -- again that is not a market we\u2019re in, but seems to be getting some legs revitalization in the defense and the intel market. We\u2019re seeing some net migrations into the region, some corporations outside of Washington they are looking at suburban options. What is funny, I went to the Cushman briefing last night on where the market is headed, and they are very big on the maturation of the order of generation, moving out to cities, forming households, having children, looking for better schools. And that\u2019s going to drive great demand in the suburbs in the coming three to five years.","Along those lines, we saw on the Dallas corridor, if you wanted more than 50,000 square-feet in the Dallas corridor, you only have three to four options to choose from. Whereas this time last year, you probably had 10 to 15. The 270 corridor still very weak, nothing to really report there, and of course with our announced Marriott deal pulling Marriott out of the North Bethesda market that will be a continued challenge we know that will come in the future. On the defense intel, as Doug mentioned, our two parts that are most directly associated with defense and intel and Apple's junction in VA 95, we\u2019ve had tremendous activity on those -- both those properties in the last three to five weeks with over 250,000 square-feet of prospects coming in since the election.","The army corridor Roseland, Boston, I think they\u2019re starting to stabilize, and getting some traction. But as long as there's value downtown, the close-end suburbs don't have their natural feeder market to generate demand as much as they would like to see. So, again as with downtown, it\u2019s much more market-by-market, although the general trend is more positive.","Jamie Feldman","Given the shift, it seems like contractors are getting a little healthier, at least the expectations post elections. Do you have any thoughts in growing more there, or continue this one?","Ray Ritchey","I mean, if the Trump initiative about freezing government hiring if that put into place, this is not the first time this has been tried both President Reagan tried to do this back in the early to mid 80s. And all that happened was the defense contractors, the private sector guys, expanded greatly to fill the void. And we'd much rather prefer doing deals with private sector contractors than try to work with the GSA on government expansions. So if in fact the freeze is put into place, we view that as a positive thing in terms of the -- the demand for those services aren\u2019t going away. And so because it shifted from the public to the private sector, that's a good thing for Northern Virginia landlords.","Jamie Feldman","And then just shifting to the GM building, maybe Mike, can you just walk us through the ins and outs there as we think about how the model is going to look the next couple of years. And also the Apple lease, can you talk about the NOI?","Douglas Linde","So, I'll refer to -- answer the second part of your question first. So we've talked about the Apple lease before, and the Under Armor lease. And I think I don't have it in front of me, but my recollection is that we're going from somewhere around $50 million plus of NOI currently to somewhere over $85 million of NOI when Apple moves back into their rehabilitated store and Under Armor has completed their work and\/or gets to live in their space and they're starting to pay on a full run rate basis. And so I think that\u2019s that part.","On the General Motors\u2019 building office space where as I think we might say we have a termination income this quarter and next quarter as the tenant moves out of the space that they're moving out of in the lower floors and then we have to lease it up. And John, if I say, we\u2019re going to lease it up in the next two days, you're going to say no. If I said we\u2019re going to lease up in the next year or so, he's going to say absolutely. And so the timing of that's going to depend upon the condition of the space when we leased it up, and the overall leasing strategy we have for it. So, I don\u2019t think there's a lot to change there over the next couple of years in General Motors.","Michael LaBelle","And the only other thing is we do have the 80,000 square-feet of current vacancy that we\u2019ve got that in July. So, as Doug mentioned, we've leased about 25,000 square-feet of that and we\u2019ve got good activity on the rest that none of that space will hit in 2017, because it's got to be built out. But I would expect all of that space should hit in 2018, I mean, that's high value space.","Jamie Feldman","And is the termination -- is that Estee Lauder, or is that lease still under discussions?","Michael LaBelle","As the Estee Lauder has lease expiration they're in almost 300,000 square-feet space. So what we're dealing with is another intendment to both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Ray, talk a little bit about JBG Smith they\u2019re coming on the radar screen. Any new hires there, any senior leasing guys that you think are particularly talented?","Ray Ritchey","That's a interesting question to answer. To those of you who don't know my son, David, recently joined head of the leasing of the combined firm. And I\u2019d say he's got one of the most challenging jobs in Washington, but it's sort of like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader going head-to-head. So we'll see how that works out in the future.","John Guinee","And second, you've been pretty busy you\u2019ve got the 2100 Penn deal done. You've got the Marriott deal. You've done a lot in L.A. I don't know if you\u2019re going to miss these deals or not. But can you talk a little bit about the potential Nestle headquarter relocation to DC, as well as the FBI never ending saga?","Ray Ritchey","I can make absolutely no comment on Nestle. First of all, I've no knowledge on Nestle, and have none capacity to comment on that at all. On the FBI, I inquired to my sources within the GSA what the impacts would be on the FBI deal on the change in administration. She says full steam ahead. But I cannot believe a President as actively involved in real-estate with such an interest who owns a major asset directly across the street from the FBI building, will not have a very profound and active role in seeing what the future that maybe. But according to GSA, it's full steam ahead, there's still three candidates left for that site. We elected to not to participate in that, even though we were selected as the finalist about a year ago and there is still three sites, two in Maryland one in Virginia that's being considered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","It sounds like the leases signed this quarter were partially cyclical in nature. But I was wondering if you could categorize at leases between expansionary versus maintaining or reducing space?","Douglas Linde","I would gather to guess, I don't have the list in front of me that there is virtually no reduction in space by any of the tenants that signed the lease this quarter. And there was likely modest expansion in the majority of the leases that were not straight renewals.","John Kim","So, it seems like from your commentary that the tenants are more optimistic than maybe perhaps you are at this point. Am I reading it correctly?","Douglas Linde","No, I actually think we're optimistic about the demand. I think our point is that there's additional supply out there. And so when you have additional supply, you still have to deal with needing to grow more than that incremental demand to make a meaningful impact on the availability and the vacancy rates, so that you can drive rents. And there's just not enough of it overall in our marketplaces to do that. So things have -- the rate of growth has moderated, which we've talked about before.","As I said, we're seeing demand growth from the technology and the life sciences businesses across the Boston marketplace and the San Francisco marketplace, and in New York City. We are seeing small signs of stability and positive growth from some of the smaller financial services companies in and around New York City and in Boston, and in San Francisco. But there happens to be more supply coming online, and that supply is impacting the market from an overall availability perspective. And so, it's awful hard to drive rental rate increases in a market like that.","John Kim","I may have missed this. But can you provide the dollar figure on the future development projects that you announced last night?","Douglas Linde","We have not yet come out with an official budget. The only development projects that we announced -- the word announce, I am going to make sure is what the right one is. We signed a lease for a development for Akamai as Owen described. That project is in Cambridge and that project will have a budget about somewhere around $400 million plus or minus. We\u2019re working through our budgets right now, so we haven't published the number in our supplemental information yet.","John Kim","And so, how do you trying to fund the development, it sounds like you have $200 million of dispositions in your guidance. But I am not sure if that is surely for guidance purposes, or if you actually think you\u2019re going to sale more than that amount?","Ray Ritchey","I think that as we have described our expectation is that we\u2019re going to raise that capital to fund our development outflows over the next few years. If you remember, the building that Doug is describing, that\u2019s not going to be done until the first quarter of '20. So, this $400 million that goes out over three years of the timeframe. So, given our leverage situation, we would anticipate that we would fund that through additional debt. I mean, there could be moderate asset sales over the next couple of years that we will supplement that. We do not typically put dispositions in our guidance, so just to point that out. We are looking at potentially $200 million of maybe asset sales. We haven't identified those asset fairly. So that\u2019s necessary in our guidance today, just to be aware.","Michael LaBelle","I think you asked a good question, or one that deserves what I think is a very optimistic answer on our part, which is that, and we\u2019ve been saying this consistently for the last year or so. We don\u2019t have any intension to raising any equity, and we believe that as the cash flow from our current development pipeline, which is already in progress, starts to hit our books and it's hitting our books '16, '17 and '18. We are building tremendous amounts of capacity to fund additional investments, and we\u2019re building additional capacity by reducing our net debt to EBITDA. So, we have a terrific opportunity to actually be more acquisitive from a development perspective or a straight acquisition perspective as we move out with our current equity base and the fact that we\u2019re growing our cash flow significantly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Mike, just wonder if you could provide some updated thoughts on plans for the GM loan refinance?","Michael LaBelle","So, that loan expires in October of 2017. It's possible that we could refinance it a little bit early. We are expecting to be talking to the market in a formal way later in the first quarter. In terms of the execution of that, we would anticipate that we are going to refinance it as mortgage finance like it is today. If you look at the cash flows that can be generated and are being generated by that asset, it's under leverage today. So, we have the ability, if we want, to risk some incremental proceeds in that way, so that could be part of the $500 million to $700 million of additional debt capital that I mentioned that we raised.","It's a large loan. So the two primary sources for that are the CMBS market which is very attractive market today. Spreads have come in over the last two or three quarters nicely. Obviously, the swap rates and treasuries have moved up 50 basis points in the last quarter, and spreads have not come in 50 basis points, but they have come in. And then we could also do a large syndicated facility with banks and insurance companies, and folks like that. So that those are kind of the two executions that we would look at to do in long-term, long-term being seven to 10 year mortgage financing.","Craig Mailman","And then just on the Oakland option for the resi, can you just give a little bit more detail about the terms of that, and where we are in the cycle. How you guys weigh that versus moving forward?","Owen Thomas","Well, we, as you know, are building our residential portfolio generally in the Company. It's currently a small component of our NOI but we have completed and have -- we've completed several successful residential developments and have a few under way. We identified the [technical difficulty] neighborhood in Oakland as a improving area and one that is attractive for development, particularly given the site that we're looking at, direct access to public transport into San Francisco, and the rents that we'll be able to offer to market are at significant discount to the rents in central San Francisco.","We are paying attention to market conditions. We understand the deliveries that are there, and we're factoring that into our underwriting. And in terms of the specific economics of the deal that we're doing, I think it's too early for us to discuss that. But when and if we decide to go forward with this project, we'll certainly describe the exact financial arrangements, but we think they're attractive.","Craig Mailman","Is it just an option you guys have, or did you -- by the way, I'm just curious how long the options for if that's the case?","Owen Thomas","Right now, it's an option. And the other activity that's going on is very important as the entitlement of the site.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just a more granular question on New York leasing and your pipeline there, you sort of walked us through, and the space that you lease-up and price points around the $100 range. Could you walk us through what you're seeing in terms of demand or even just early showings that you might have done around some of the new redevelopments that you're doing?","Owen Thomas","John, you want to take that one?","John Powers","Sure. Well, we\u2019ve had -- we're dealing with a number of different buildings. I think we have very good showings at 159, and we're looking for like a 150,000 foot tenant. We had very good activity in the Tower at 399 the seventh floor is very difficult to show right now because of the construction project that's ongoing.","Vikram Malhotra","And just, but just in terms of which sector -- are you seeing broad range of sectors. Is it more finance? And just a sense of price points, are they similar to expirations or wider range?","John Powers","I think it's a pretty broad range, some financial service firms, and some corporates.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just a quick clarification, I remember last quarter, there was an asset in Springfield you were marketing. I think there was someone circling around the tenant, and you took that off. Any update on the potential sale there?","Owen Thomas","That project is VA 95. And as we announced the last quarter, the primary tenant in the project announced -- put out an RFP for a potential consolidation. So that uncertainty made the asset more difficult to market. And frankly the consolidation could be an opportunity for us, because we're going to compete for that. But we need to, I would say, re-stabilize that building before considering selling it. I also just want John to take a victory lap. I think we were identified as the highest, the leading real-estate company in New York with lease space over $100 square foot in 2016. So, the volumes in that market are not large, but we captured the highest share last year.","Vikram Malhotra","That\u2019s good to know. Thank you very much.","John Powers","By the way, that\u2019s not our usual. But thank you very much, Owen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick, Cap One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","I'll keep it brief since we're pretty late into the call here. But earlier, you guys mentioned properties in need to CapEx in your markets. Bigger picture, how do you guys view the risk adjusted value proposition between development and well located value-add acquisitions? And how that changed at all in the last few quarters?","Owen Thomas","Well, we prefer or we -- actually I would say, exclusively right now, are making investments where we can use our real-estate skills to create value. Doug described it in his remarks that a key value proposition for whole company. So, we're not interested in purchasing stabilized assets, the cap rates in the force, because they -- when we have the opportunity to create more value by either buying under-let assets or by development. And I think the examples of that are we have a very significant multi-billion dollar development pipeline underway, and we're still forecasting a cash NOI yield upon delivery for that portfolio in excess of 7%. All the projects that we delivered last year were in excess of 7%.","And when we think those buildings are delivered, again it depends a little bit on where they are and what there. But if again stabilize buildings in our core markets are selling for four, because that's a significant profit that's realized by shareholders. So, to the extent we can continue to find projects, they're painful that way. We want to go forward with them. I would say the one thing that has changed that we've talked about over the last few quarters as we get further into the economic recovery as we see supply in our markets that does describe our pre-letting requirement for launching a new development had elevated.","We don't have exact percentage that we adhere to, because it depends on the project and scale and the market condition. But clearly, our threshold for pre-letting is higher in office today. And I would say the other thing by the way we've done in addition to development is trying to purchase assets where when we lease them and when they roll to market that we will own them at a premium yield, certainly the 4%. And I think Colorado Center deal I would point to much recently that we did where I think those facts are going to come true.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Rob Simone","My questions have all been answered. I was curious if you guys have selected any candidates for the asset sales that Mike mentioned. But you guys touched on that, so I\u2019m good. Thanks.","Owen Thomas","Good. Well again, that concludes the questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties and your time and attention today. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3543":["Boston Properties, Inc.

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.","Owen Thomas","Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. We just completed another strong quarter capping off one of the most productive and successful years in Boston Properties' history. Specifically, in 2018, we completed 7.2 million square feet of leasing, our second highest level of annual leasing ever. We delivered and placed in service 2.3 million square feet of new developments, the commercial component of which is a 100% lease. We commenced 2 million square feet of new developments, which are 80% preleased in the aggregate with strong customers such as Verizon, Fannie Mae and Leidos as anchor tenants.","We completed important new acquisition joint venture including Santa Monica Business Park, doubling our Los Angeles presence, and a site at 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York that can accommodate 2 million square feet of new development. We completed approximately 720 million of non-core asset sales. We increased in-service portfolio occupancy, 70 basis points over the years to 91.4%. And lastly, we increased our regular quarterly dividend 19%. In fact Boston Properties has increased its regular quarterly dividend by more than 46% over the past three years.","And more recently in the fourth quarter of 2018, we generated FFO per share in line with prior guidance, and up 7% year-over-year. We leased 1.8 million square feet including of 300,000 square-foot leased with Millennium Management at 399 Park, bringing this focus asset to 93% leased. We raised $1 billion as the green bond in the unsecured debt market on favorable terms, and we increased the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2019 by $0.11, raising our projected 2019 growth to over 10% at the midpoint.","Our performance in 2018 highlights the key characteristics that make Boston Properties unique and its ability to generate growth and shareholder returns in the office sector. Our high quality Class A assets allow us to attract premium rents from long-term creditworthy tenants. Our scale and diverse yet concentrated market selection allows us to benefit from growth within the strongest markets in the U.S., while minimizing risk of single market sector or customer weakness.","Our development expertise and portfolio of sites gives us the opportunity to win important mandates with customers and ensure our growth is driven by a strong pipeline of preleased development, driving higher return. And our modest leverage and growing portfolio NOI provides capacity for new investment without issuing public equity, also driving FFO growth. I'm very proud of our team at Boston Properties and what we are able to accomplish in 2018 through our experience, relationships, teamwork and commitment to success.","Now let's turn to the market environment, which has become increasingly dynamic and trends impacting our business. Economic growth in the U.S. and worldwide, hit an inflection point in the fourth quarter. Global and U.S. GDP growth is slowing and elevated trade tensions as well as government dysfunctions given the recent U.S. shutdown and Brexit will have a further negative impact, so called globalization is taking hold and possibly accelerating. As a result, central banks including the Fed in December and January shifted to a much more dovish tone on interest rates and quantitative tightening. As a result, 10-year U.S. treasuries now at around 2.7% which is about 50 basis points below its high in early November.","So what does all this mean for Boston Properties? First, we're not overly concerned about the near-term recession and expect slowing U.S. economic growth to plateau and stabilize above 2% at least for now. Second, our long stated view and interest rate risks are overblown has proven true and given the recent Fed rhetoric, we certainly expect rates to stay low for the foreseeable future, a significant positive for real estate value.","Lastly, we see no current signs of abatements in mostly robust leasing markets we have enjoyed. So, we recognize leasing activity lags economic growth and financial market movements and therefore risks of slowing leasing activity or higher. We remain constructive on further investing activity given economic growth and low interest rates. That said, we have adjusted our risk thresholds and we will be increasingly discerning our new acquisitions of launching new development.","We continue to believe investment in new developments is more accretive to shareholders and repurchasing our shares, and we will continue to use private equity capital to help fund new investments in order to avoid either issuing public equity at our current share price or materially increasing our leverage. In the private real estate market, significant office building transaction volumes increased to 24% in the fourth quarter and 4% for all of '18.","Though investors are increasingly selective there were multiple significant office transactions completed again at sub 5% cap rates in the fourth quarter of last year. Examples include here in Boston in the Financial District 53 States Street sold for $685 a foot and a 4.6 cap rate to domestic operator with U.S. and non-U.S. capital. This was a 1.2 million square-foot building that was or is 94% leased. In Beverly Hills, UTA Plaza and Ice House sold for $954 a foot and a 4.6% cap rate. This is a 240,000 square-foot property and fully leased and sold to a domestic opportunity fund.","In New York, 425 Lexington Avenue located near Grand Central sold for $940 a foot and a 4.5% cap rate to a domestic real estate firm. This is a 750,000 square-foot building and is 95% leased. In Mountain View, California Shoreline Technology Center sold for $1 billion or $1,250 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate to a user that occupied 92% of the building. This is a 12 building 52 acre site is 800,000 square feet and is fully leased. In San Francisco, the 110,000 square-foot 100% leased 345 Brannan Building sold for $1,326 a foot and a high 4s cap rates to a domestic REIT. And finally in Washington DC, 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue sold for $1,032 a foot and 5% cap rate to a domestic investment manager. This building is about 340,000 feet and is fully leased.","Now moving to our capital activities, as mentioned, development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value and we remain active pursuing both new preleased projects and sites for future projects. Since our last earnings call, we progressed further our development pipeline activities. With the recent deliveries into service of the Salesforce Tower and Spring Street, our current development and redevelopment pipeline stands at 11 office and residential projects comprising 5.3 million square feet and 2.7 billion of investment for our share, most of the projects are well underway and we have $1.6 billion remaining to find. The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% preleased and the aggregate projected cash yields are estimated to be approximately 7% upon stabilization.","Also in 2019, we expect to commence the development of 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and 325 Main Street in Cambridge. These projects aggregate 870,000 square feet, $760 million in new investments and are 75% preleased. We also completed three new acquisitions. In San Jose, we ground lease with the right to purchase next year Platform 16, a site with the potential for 1.1 million square feet of new office development. The purchase right is for approximately a $125 per square foot for the site which is located within walking distance of Diridon Station, San Jose\u2019s primary transportation hub with active Caltrain, BART, and future high-speed rail and adjacent to Google's plant 8 million square foot transit village. Large scale transit oriented site in the Silicon Valley are in high demand and rare.","We are also in discussions with capital partners to make a significant investment in this site and the eventual vertical development. More recently in January, we exercised an expiring purchase option for all the remaining development land at Carnegie Center, which can support up to 1.7 million square feet of future development for $42.9 million. So growth in the Princeton market is modest, we have uses for a portion of the property and believe our Carnegie Center asset is more valuable with the existing buildings and development opportunity unified. Also this month, we committed to purchase Heinz's 5% interest net of our advances in Salesforce Tower and settled their carried interest arrangement.","Lastly, on capital activities, we have an extremely successful year for disposition, selling $720 million of non-core assets and exceeding our $300 million goal for the year. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 1333 in Hampshire Avenue in Washington DC for a $142 million. We call this asset will be vacated by Akin Gump in 2019 and in is as releasing of the building doesn't fit our current operating strategy.","We presold the TSA Development project in Springfield Virginia for $98 million, which is a reimbursement of cost today including our land. If you include the future funding assumed by the buyer, the total sale price is $324 million including development fees to Boston Properties and the forward cap rate is approximately 6%. Given this is a GSA leased asset with flat rents in a suburban location, we would have sold the asset at completion and elected to do it early to free-up capital for our growing development investment.","We completed the transfer of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction One, a 118,000 square foot property located in suburban Maryland to our JV partner in the property. It is our intention to exit the remaining assets we hold in Annapolis Junction overtime. And we fully exited our investment in Tower Oaks preserve business Park in Rockville Maryland by completing in December the sale of a 41 acre parcel of land for $46 million and in January the sale of 26 Tower Oaks, a 179,000 square foot building for $22.7 million or a $127 of square foot.","In summary, 2018 was a very successful year for Boston Properties. Given our robust development pipeline and lease-up activity for in-service and assets and like our home town favorite New England Patriots, we\u2019re well positioned to put more wins on the board in 2019 and beyond.","Let me turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Linde","Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody. Go back, we had great leasing success in 2018 including the four leases from major new developments that Owen described and our development delivery income continues to accelerate, and it is certainly true there is a barometer of real time economic activity, looking at our revenue from the office leasing business, really a lagging indicator, given the lead times inherent in our transaction cycle. It is also true that the decisions made by our customers a year ago or two years ago or even five years ago are just starting to be seen in our top line revenue and they are contractual and growing for years to come. So, let\u2019s have a case in point at Salesforce Tower.","We signed our first lease in April of 2014 and the building won't achieve its all occupied rent revenue run rate until October of this year. Starting at that point, the contractual cash rent increases on average 2 plus percent per year. The first lease exploration in the building and it's only about 70,000 square feet is 2027, and based on the last few deals and inferior buildings in the market in '18, the rent on that particular lease is somewhere between 35% and 40% below markets today.","As Owen despite the macroeconomic volatility leasing activity feels a lot like 2018. Our primary customer large real-estate users either public or private start ups are established continue to make decision the upgrade and consolidators space and in some cases it's been. While we continue to see the bulk of office demands growth from the technology and the life science businesses, and flexible space operators there is also robust demand for new space do not necessarily growth space from traditional industries, as evidenced by the incredible activity in Manhattan in 2018.","So let's talk about the markets. Our expectations and what's going on in our portfolio. I'm going to begin with New York City. In October 2017, at our investor conference, I stated that our biggest opportunities were higher contribution occupancy improvements in 2019 and 2020 would emanate from 1590 E 53rd Street and 399 Park Avenue and I put John Powers, Andrew Levin and Heather Kahn on the spot. We announced the 30-year lease for all the space at 159 earlier this year with cash rent and hopefully revenue recognition at the end of '19.","And then during the fourth quarter and the first week of '19, we've signed leases totaling 554,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue. These transaction include the leasing in the entirety of the low rise vacancy, the block of space were in 7, 8, 9 and 10 to 252,000 square feet and is part of the same transactions, we agreed to recapture 57,000 square feet on the sixth floor, which is expiring in 2020 and leases for the same tenants. On floors 33 through 35, we need to recapture 73,000 square feet, which is expiring in 2021 and we re-let that entire space to new tenants that's going to stay through 2035 or longer.","And finally, we recaptured 97,000 square feet expiring in 2026 on the fourth floor and we released 75,000 square feet along with the our renewal of the 97,000 square feet on the fifth floor through 2037. So we've leased 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, the entire lower rise of the building. We've surpassed our revenue expectations for 2019 and 2020 from the vacant place and we still have 97,000 square feet, the block of space from 18 to 21 available and ready to lease immediately. The expiring gross rent on the 554,000 square feet that I just described was $82 a square foot and the first year rent is about $90 a square foot. There have been a number of recent market causing reports on New York City, and it was quite clear that 2018, was a banner year from activity perspective.","The point I would make are as follows: On the margins, there has been a lot of new construction delivered or soon to deliver and the overall availability rate has actually helped steady. And it's actually gone down slightly in Midtown. The addition of new construction underway at 425 Park in One Vanderbilt, 50 Hudson and 6600 Boulevard and the repositioning of buildings like 550 Madison all have acting rents above a $100 a square foot and a $100 plus acting rents are prevalent all over Midtown South. So the inventory of high end space has increased significantly.","There was over 4 million square feet of leasing over $100 a square foot last year including renewals in Manhattan in a total market activity of about 38 million square feet. 85% of the deals above $100 a square foot were under 50,000 square feet and averaged around 15,000 square feet. The leasing activity drops dramatically above a $120 a square foot. Overall, we continue to see concessions the free rent build out time in TIs remain very constant and slight uptick in rents in those buildings or submarkets that have gotten tighter.","Moving to Washington DC, it continues to be the most challenging market conditions amongst our regions. As you read in our press release and heard from Owen, we have reduced our portfolio exposure in both the CBD and suburban DC market through asset sales. Our new activities are focused on the long-term leases we have signed that will commence with the delivery of our new development between 2020 and 2023. In the CBD, there are lot of new partially leased deliveries and relatively little new demand outside the flexible office providers that actually absorb over 800,000 square feet in 2018. Based on our experience and that's where we have one of these providers, their customers are small entities and operators that are truly aggregating demand that we could never accommodate. This has been a really good thing.","With base rent on leases that are stable it's all about concessions and rent commencement days. We have and we will continue to use our operating skills and relationships to gain occupancy at market terms and we will do as many 4000, 20,000, 50,000 square feet deals as necessary to feel our availability in the CBD. The Washington DC region makes up about 17.8% of our total company NOI, down from 21% in 2015 with the CBD at just over 7% of our total NOI so relatively speaking a small portion of the Company's assets.","The Northern Virginia portfolio comprises over 53% although regional contribution is growing and has much better leasing activity due to the more diverse demand days which contains a significant number of government contractors, technology companies and other corporate users. We have a number of renewal discussions underway including our 492,000 square feet at the New Dominion, which is leased to the GSA as well as the 275,000 square feet tenants in Reston Town Center.","In 2019 and 2020, we will have exposure on our Reston portfolio, as Leidos relocates from their 170,000 square-foot accommodation into the new 270,000 square-foot premises at 1750 and tenants who growth, we were not able to accommodate in 2017 and 2018, we just didn't have the space start to lease. We are in active discussions with two existing tenants. They are looking to expand their 50,000 square-foot installations to new tenants looking for a minimum of 75,000 square feet of piece and a whole host of 7,000 to 10,000 square-foot users that are focused on our amenity rich environment. We will be rolling out a number of place making enhancements during 2019 to our Town Center assets as we get ready for the addition of Metro in our Reston price redevelopment which will open in 2022.","Moving West, in LA, we brought Colorado Center to 100% leased and with our limited availability at the Santa Monica Business Park we are focused on early renewals at both properties. With the expected relocation of HBO in December of '20, we have the ability to accommodate the growth of other tenants at Colorado center. And at the Santa Monica Business Park, we are working on getting ahead of our 2020 expirations. The West LA market had an active 2018 beginning of 2019 as a number of large technology companies expanded their footprint in the area. This included Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon, the same name that you hear by the Silicon Valley as well as a number of flexible office operators including new work and spaces and industrial. Rental rates continue to rise and there are limited big walk availabilities in the West LA market.","The story in San Francisco CBD is lack of availability. The vacancy rates are at its lowest levels since the last cycle began after the great financial crisis. There are virtually no direct or somewhat space in the market over a 100,000 square feet other than 50 deals. The only new construction the first admission development won\u2019t deliver until 2023 at the earliest. We understand there is a leasing negotiation for all over the 255,000 square feet at 633 wholesome the only large addition flat major renovation undergoing the city right now.","A technology company just leased a 150,000 square feet at One Maritime adjacent to Embarcadero Center and the majority of Salesforce Sublet when they moved into our building at Saleforce Tower has been leased. This Central SoMa plan is under a sequel litigation and will likely delay the ability to commence construction even if the Planning Commission grants the particular site entitlements and allots a plot and allocation. There continues to be significant demand in the market.","Since 2011, more than 50% of the annual leasing has come from the technology companies and the total occupied base of the market has move from 22% tech and 2013 about 15 million square feet to more 37% in \u201918 or 30 million square feet, so with double almost more than we could possibly have imagine. In our portfolio, Salesforce Tower, 535 Mission, 680 and 690 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne are all 100% leased. And Embarcadero Center, we ended the quarter at 91.4% and completed 258,000 square feet of leasing within existing rent in place of $61 a square foot growth and new starting rent of $85 a square foot up 40%.","The lease commencement to run from February 19 through July of 2020, when a new tenants take those action of the 125,000 square feet of EC3 when the existing tenant than vacant. If you include all the space that is either leased but not yet occupied of our office occupancy, it would jump to 95%. And we currently have another 250,000 square foot under negotiation that could be completed during the first quarter of 2019. If you want a floor space at Embarcadero Center, you\u2019ll probably have to wait until the next delivery of available space in November 30, 2019 when our next full floor not under negotiation expires, a long time.","Last but not least, all three of our Boston markets, the CBC, Cambridge and Waltham Lexington continue to be the beneficiaries of ongoing growth in the technology and the life science sectors along with the very manageable new construction. The new buildings that have been started have been size to the market with a very little aggregate speculative space. Our 100 Causeway Way project which is expect to open in \u201921 is a great example. We announced the start of 640,000 square foot tower with a 437,000 square foot commence. An existing tenant at the Podium building at 100 Causeway Way picked up 66,000 square feet for expansion and we\u2019re negotiating lease for the final 125,000 square feet.","In Waltham, we started a 211,000 square foot building at City Point with a 110,000 square foot lease and have since leased another 121,000 square feet and have 75,000 square feet remaining. In the last few months, there were additional growth announcements in all of our Boston markets. In Cambridge a life science company committed to a 900,000 square-foot new series of building, and we signed our 365,000 square foot release for three 325 Maine, which we hope to start construction during the second quarter of this year.","In Waltham, the only significant speculative office development during this cycle has activity that will bring its occupancy to 75%. And in Boston's Financial District, last week State Street Bank committed to be lead tenants in the 500,000 square feet of space at One Congress. And the remaining 0.5 million square feet in that project and the backfill of their existing location at One Lincoln should be satisfied by other demands. The challenges we have in our Boston portfolio is not just similar at Embarcadero San Francisco lack of space. So, we are focused on future explorations.","In late '17, our tenant at 33 Hayden Ave in Lexington 81,000 square-foot has with a 2019 December exploration made the decision to relocate into Boston. During the first week in January, we terminated their lease, and signed a lease for all of the states with the life science company that will take occupancy at the end of this year with a 94% increase in the rent. At 111 Huntington Avenue, we leased two floors one expiring in December 2020 and the other expiring in December of 2021 with an increase of 37% to a growing tenant in that building.","And to give you a sense of the changes in market rents. At 200 Clarendon Street, we leased a 30,000 square-foot full floor for a short-term about a 1.5 year in the middle of 2017, that space became vacant in August of 2018. Late last year, we've negotiated a similar term lease at a 12% increased in rent as it is based. Rents in Boston, Cambridge and Lexington had strong increases in 2018, along with a decline in concessions and we expect the same in '19. So as I stated at the outset, at this moment, the conditions across our entire portfolio feel very much the way they did in 2018.","And I'll stop there and let the call go to Mike.","Mike LaBelle","Great, thank you, Doug. Good morning. As I always said, we end at -- we had another strong quarter in the fourth quarter. Once again, our portfolio of revenues increased sequentially just over to 4% over last quarter and 7% year-over-year. We also grew our share of same property NOI by 3.4% on a GAAP basis and 7.9% on a cash basis over the same quarter last year. And net rents on our second generation leases that commenced this quarter were up over 11% over the expiring lease, all of these are positive trends.","Our occupancy climbed to 92.1%, which is a 100 basis point higher than last quarter, if you exclude the delivery of Salesforce Tower. We brought Salesforce Tower into the in-service portfolio this quarter at 70% occupancy which dampened our overall occupancy to 91.4%. Salesforce Tower is a 100% leased, and we expect all of the office tenants will be in occupancy by the end of the third quarter of 2019. We issued a $1 billion green bond with a 4.5% coupon in the quarter and use the portion of the proceeds to redeem $700 million of high coupon 5.78% bond that were due to expire in late 2019.","We booked the loss on debt extinguishment of $16.5 million or $0.10 per share, which was primarily the yield maintenance penalty for paying off the bonds early. This charge was included in our adjusted guidance issued in December. We are now taking care of all of our material debt, maturities through late 2020. We reported fourth quarter funds from operations of the $1.59 per share and full year funds from operations at $6.30 per share, which was in line with our guidance.","Portfolio revenues and management service fee income were both slightly ahead of our plans but they were offset by higher than projected G&A expense of approximately $0.01 per share. As Owen and Doug described we had a fantastic year of leasing and the fourth quarter was no exception. We signed over 1.8 million square feet in the quarter, including 750,000 square feet in mid town Manhattan. The vast majority of these leases had no impact on the fourth quarter earnings results, but they will have a positive impact on 2019 and beyond.","In addition to the significant leasing activity in New York City, we also have strong activity in San Francisco and Boston both for new leases on vacant space, as well as the large number of early renewals for leases expiring between 2019 and 2021 where we expect to get increases in rents. Based on the continued leasing velocity we are increasing our assumption for year-over-year growth and our share of 2019 GAAP same property NOI by 75 basis points at the midpoint to 4.5% to 6% over 2018. We are keeping our cash same property growth assumption at 4.5% to 6.5% as many of the deals we are tracking are early renewals or new leases that will not commence cash rent until late in 2019 or 2020. As a result, we have also increased our assumptions for 2019 straight-line rents by $10 million to $85 million to $110 million.","In our non-same property portfolio we are moderating our assumption for the incremental NOI growth in 2019 slightly but $5 million at the midpoint of our range due to minor changes in occupancy timing in our development portfolio. This is comprised of pushing back occupancy by a month or two for some of our office users, as well as the retail space at the hub on Causeway based upon adjusted build out schedule. Generally, our clients are in control of their build out and pay rent on a fixed date. However, we cannot recognize revenue until they complete their work which is not in our control. We are often able to pick up the difference by continuing to capitalized interest, which you will see in our interest expense assumptions.","We've increased our assumptions for development and management services income to $40 million to $45 million for the full year an increase of $3 million at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. The most significant change this quarter came from our sale of the TSA headquarters development. We've entered into a development agreement with the buyer and we earned fees for our development services over the next two years.","And lastly, we are reducing our interest expense assumption by approximately $8 million in 2019. We now expect net interest expense to total between $410 million and $425 million for the full year. The reduced expense assumption is from a combination of the new bond deal and bond redemption transactions in December and a reduction in our projected line of credit usage, primarily due to the sale of our TSA development. Our capitalized interest projections have remained steady with the last capitalized interest for the TSA development offset by higher capitalized interest for our other developments.","So overall, we are increasing our guidance for 2019 funds from operations by $0.11 per share at the midpoint to a new range of $6.88 to $7 per share. The increase is comprised of $0.7 per share from higher same property portfolio NOI, $0.5 per share of lower interest expense, $0.2 per share of higher fee income offset by a reduction of $0.3 per share of NOI from our developments. Our guidance does not include any additional acquisitions or dispositions, other than what we included in our press release. We are continuing to see positive trends in our markets, resulting in leasing successes that are driving up our organic growth. Additionally, our development pipeline is well leased and provides assured external growth over the next several years. This combination of both internal and external growth points to very strong FFO growth at our midpoint for 2019 of over 10% from 2018.","Operator that completes our formal remarks, if you can turn it over to Q&A that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Just focusing on New York for a second, if you think about Brookfields announcements that goes back at 2 Hudson Yards. Just wondering if that curtails anything about your 3 Hudson developments whether it'd be your desire to go spec or wait for tenants to come in or if there is any shift in timing for that development?","Doug Linde","So, I'll make a brief comment and join in John Powers, I'm assuming you're on and you can you can add on. So at the moment with the two developments at the Hudson Yards, there is -- in one building, there\u2019s just over 1.5 million square feet and the other building just over 1.2 million square feet of available place. And if the announcement that you saw yesterday, it's actually true that the Brookfields tends to start on spec that's another 2 million square feet. So, that's 4 million square feet right there. And then obviously, you have other buildings in Midtown Manhattan that are under construction. I think that we would certainly be looking to have a significant amount of preleasing before we started. John?","John Powers","Well, Doug's giving you the facts there. On our situation, we've been working hard since we closed the deal with Joe to redesign the building and we've done that. We're in a 100% BDs now. The construction is ongoing on the foundations and we're talking to some tenants in the market, but clearly we need a significant interest from tenants to move forward with the project. We're very excited with the redesign by the way and it's been very well received by the tenants that we showed it to.","Manny Korchman","The other question I was just looking at sort of new markets and new submarkets you're looking at. Is there anything else out there that you're actively tracking that you could share with us right now.","Owen Thomas","Manny, it's Owen, good morning. Nothing outside the perimeter that we've described.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market.","John Kim","I wanted to ask on some of the components of your guidance change this quarter from last quarter which includes the higher occupancy assumption. What was that primarily due to? And also if you could talk about the termination fee where this was coming from and how likely it is you are going to release the space?","Owen Thomas","So, the guidance change is obviously we increased our guidance last quarter and we also announced I guess earlier this month that we signed a bunch of leases that Doug spoke of in New York City which is over 550000 square feet. We were working on some of those leases last quarter, but they clearly weren't complete. So, we were certainly handicapping the likelihood of those things. And I would say, the execution of those leases some of which are starting you know revenue although not cash revenue in the first and second quarter brought up the drive up the bottom line of our guidance because we got those things. I would say that with a continued velocity of activity that we're seeing in our markets is driving up the high end in the overall guidance range. So those are really the two pieces that are on that are hitting occupancy the increase in the occupancy and the increase in guidance range. Obviously a little bit also came from interest expense as I mentioned.","On the terminations, Doug really spoke about the recaptures both in Boston, suburban Boston, he mentioned one and in New York. So we're recapturing space that is expiring, a year from now or even five years from now, and we are getting termination payments that will that are driving our termination income guidance in 2019, which is higher than 2018, but were doing that because we have leases that are signed. So, there may be some interruption in cash rent while that tenant builds out their space, but ultimately what we're doing is we're signing leases now and based and very strong market at strong rental rates that are much higher than the expiring rental rate because we think that we want to take advantage of the market condition we're in.","John Kim","And then if I can ask on the sale of the TSA developments and the impairment that you took as part of that sale. Is your view that the market value of this asset will not exceed the cost? And if that's the case, what's really changed since you out of growth of development?","Owen Thomas","So, there's a, I would say a lot of financial counting minutiae that's involved in how we recorded the sale of the TSA development. I would just point out two things. One is that we are guaranteeing completion and we are also entitled to any savings under the contingency line item in the budget, as well as we are getting significant development fees when you include those things along with clinical with our land cost was. This was a profitable development for us from a valuation creation perspective. And that counting just let us to having to report as the way it was reported.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Owen, just going back to your commentary about being a little bit more cautious on how you guys are looking at developments other than kind of higher preleasing targets potentially on some of these. Are you guys changing at all your yield requirements or any other underwriting kind of items?","Owen Thomas","Yes, I wouldn't say that we changed our yield requirements I had pointed to you in fact, the reference rate the 10 year U.S. treasury drop 50 basis points in the last few months. So by keeping our yields flat in essence we increased profit. But I think the answer to your question has a couple of things. One, as you suggest, you know what kinds of preleasing are we going to require for new developments, and I know everyone wants us to give a precise number on that question and that's not really feasible or possible given that all circumstances are different depending on the scale of the building and the economics, and the velocity in the market, and all that type of thing.","But yes, I do think we will today seek to have even more preleasing before we launch new developments, and also I think it's being disciplined and looking at new acquisitions of both buildings and sites I mean for example, recently we were chasing a site that we were interested in here in the Boston region and we topped out, at a particular value and at least based on the knowledge that we have today, we are not going to win that. So that would be an example of the increase disciplined that I described.","Doug Linde","Yes, Craig, I think in big picture our underwriting criteria have just gotten a little bit more stringent or you thought you might lease up space quickly by elongated where you think you are going to be able to have to provide an improvement allowances or get rental rate increases you might temper those expectations. And so it just all adds into the formula and so it just makes it a little bit more difficult to go after something that we otherwise might have been more aggressive on a year ago.","Craig Mailman","And then on Platform 16 just some clarifying points. On the purchase option of 125 bucks a foot, is that on the buildable 1.1 million? Or is that kind of land that they are\u2026","Owen Thomas","Yes, that\u2019s on the buildable.","Craig Mailman","So you guys are looking for all like 137 million potentially on that. And then are you guys the way the co-development is going with a partner are they kind of doing the non-office and you guys are doing all the spend on the office? Or could you just give us a little more color on how that works?","Doug Linde","So this is pure office development, and the group that put it together is staying involved in the development component, and we are the principal capital partner and we will ultimately own 100% of the asset. All being said as Owen described, we are in serious discussions with a capital partner to participate in our interest on a long-term basis.","Craig Mailman","Have you guys had discussions with tenants? Or your discussions about higher preleasing with this project given the adjacency to Google and everything going on in San Jose kind of require less in your view to go forward or how are you guys thinking about it?","Doug Linde","So let me just answer the question in the following way and then I'll let Bob talk about leasing conversations. So, the property is an assemblage site and we are literally as we speak I believe, doing surveying work and within expectation that we are going to demolish all the existing structures, do all the relocation of utilities and what we refer to is the enabling work that\u2019s all going to go on over the next six plus or minus months. Then this is a structure of a series of buildings and they all sit on top of a subterranean parking structure.","And we will then make a decision as to when we want to start that subterranean parking structure and how we would phase. And this is a feasible project. And so, you know no different than when we started our conversations about Salesforce Tower back in 2013. We are moving forward. We are excited about the project and we are hopeful that leasing markets will provide us with a tenant or tenants well in anticipation of our commencing instructions but you never know. So Bob do you want to just comment on the leasing activity?","Bob Pester","Yes, we had discussions with tenants and we plan to talk to other tenants. I think the important thing to point on the site is it's the only transit oriented site between San Francisco and San Jose that will have both Caltrain and BART access. BART has actually just started construction this past week where you can provide up to 1 million square feet at a location.","Jordan Sadler","Hey, Doug, it's Jordan Sadler. One other quick one for you, if I could. Your cadence on the New York City in the prepared remarks seemed pretty positive particularly given the asking rents on new development. Do you expect New York to see an improvement and net effectives in '19?","Doug Linde","We certainly think that net effective rents are not going down and that there will be modest increases in the rental rates and the concession packages will have half blackout.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","As you guys mentioned, these are some turbulent times with respect to what\u2019s going in DC, given that the government is your second largest tenant, I was just hoping you guys could touch on any specific areas within your portfolio? Do you think could see some disruption because of the shut down and also if you could touch on any possible effect on Fannie Mae as you guys move ahead with their 850,000 square foot build to suit in Reston?","Owen Thomas","Ray or Peter do you want to take that.","Ray Ritchey","Well, I\u2019ll start and Peter can jump on. First of all as relates to GSA, one of the great things about leases there, they are long and strong and not related to annual appropriations. So, we have seen actually no change in the current GSA structure as relates to our existing leases. We have a major lease expiring here in a few months and we feel very, very confident about the renewal there. As it relates to Fannie Mae, it remains one of the most profitable entities in the Unites States government. So, we are very much positive about the outcome of the development. They\u2019re still keeping all those space. They have the option to take more. They\u2019ll be in our conference room today just to talk about the status of the construction, and we\u2019ll force them ahead, doing very good about the NMA.","Peter Johnston","Yes, I\u2019d also jump in. The deal that was referenced earlier in the call at New Dominion is actually what the government agencies that's already exercised their independent leasing authority, and it happens to also be a mission critical location for the government and the buildings are at the highest level of security that\u2019s provided would be almost impossible to replicate in any kind of reasonable timeframe. So in that regard, we feel very good about the near term exposure.","Ray Ritchey","And we have also mitigated our exposure with the sale of 580 and the presale of GSA. So, our exposure to the government is much less than it was even three or four months ago.","Blaine Heck","And then maybe, Mike, can you just touch on the Salesforce buyout? How was the 187 million calculated? Or maybe how is that allocated between the buyout of the 5% interest in the property? And any promotes that were paid? And how does that bio affect the yield on your total investment in the property?","Mike LaBelle","So, Blaine, this is going to be really unsatisfying answer, but we\u2019re in discussions with the City Assessor right now and it's just not appropriate to discuss how the valuation was done and what it was, how all of those sort of elements were figured out, we just can\u2019t talk about.","Blaine Heck","Lastly, noticeably, the estimated total investment on 159 East 53rd increased quite a bit from 106 million last quarter to 150 million this quarter. Can you just touch on what change there and is that going to have any effect on the pro forma yield that you guys are looking at?","Owen Thomas","So, the reason that the cost were driven up were almost entirely due to the lease that we have with NYU which is a 30 year lease versus what we originally underwrote which would have been a shorter term lease, effectively kind of 15 years would have been what we would have underwrote. So the leasing commission associated with that and the tenant improvement associated with that are the majority of that increase and that lease officially came out of escrow within the last quarter. So we determine to put that into our budget this quarter because there was uncertainty.","The only other thing that really changed on this, we\u2019re making some enhancements to the retail aspect of the job and improving the design and what the retail environment and atmosphere is going to be that takes the most significant advantage of the opportunity that we have to upgrade the place taking there, so that's a design is driving a little bit more cost into that part of the job, as well. And but we still expect the project to meet the return criteria that we typically sellout for this type of development.","Doug Linde","But just to be perfectly honest about this, this is a place making exercise as we said there is a great incremental investment on the works that we did at $159 to the 185,000 square feet that we release to the tenants that taking for 30 years. The incremental return on the capital for the food hall and the other \"place making experiences is de minimis\", and it\u2019s really going to be reflected in the ability to rent space at 601 Lexington Avenue, 399 Park Avenue, and 599 Lexington Avenue, so it's not really -- the yield was not with that result.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","I'm hoping to get related thoughts on co-working and what you think that tenant base is going to mean for the office sector going forward? I mean we've seem, rework has had a little bit of trouble raising its flash around the capital and we've seen kind of proliferation of different types of approaches to that business. So, as we -- just kind of an update on what your latest thoughts are and what you think it's going to mean for you guys?","Owen Thomas","It's Owen. Look, we continue to believe co-working I'll call it shared workspace business to be an important sector of the office business it's been, it's been an important net absorber of space, I think in the markets where we operate, the total square footage of this lease by these operators today is somewhere between 2.5% and 5% depending on the city and it has been growing. We work as clearly the leader by scale, but there are other operators and in fact as discussed on our prior call where we've been doing it some of it ourselves on a small scale basis in a couple of our buildings.","So I think the business has created important new options for customers for individual and retail customers it's a way to get into a community and a high quality space and in many cases, high-quality buildings and from landlords it's aggregated demand that would be otherwise very difficult to leases too. So I think that's been very positive. And I think for a larger companies it's given them flexibility, we don't see companies -- large companies taking all of their space requirements and putting it into shared workspace, but we certainly see some of them procuring single-digit percentages of their space on a flexible basis to try to manage that -- the space procurement process which can be difficult, when human resource requirements are a lot more volatile than their ability to procure space.","So, there has been a lot of press lately about we work ability to raise additional equity capital that may have some impact on the business. We don't know yet, but in general, I would say this sector is an important part of the office business, and as we think it's been a very positive and many of the shared workspace companies like we work are important customers of Boston properties.","Doug Linde","And Jaime just to add a couple more thoughts, so if we think about our portfolio and how the flexible office operators have impacted our portfolio and the margin we think it's been a positive trends for the kinds of spaces that we have listed them in the places where we have lease that space and at the same time and I don\u2019t think its coincidence we have done more large, long term leasing with corporate customers, call it the last 2.5 to 3 years than we have ever done in our history. And our average lease rent has actually gone up slightly as opposed to down slightly. So it has not impacted our business at all in terms of our portfolio other than again in those instances where we have done a transaction with one of these operators we think it's incrementally help us in some way shape or form.","In Washington DC its aggregating demand and Embarcadero center it changed the image of a particular space which we use as a showcase to demonstrate to nontraditional tenants how they could use Embarcadero centers infrastructure to change the image of their space at 200 Clarendon St. we were struggling with convincing people that this was not a attired state financial services building and we did a transaction and then we got a whole host of customers who actually use the flexible officer provider space on a short-term basis while we were building out their space in the building so it was a great shock absorber.","So there are lots of different reasons why this company works. And it is here to stay there are clearly places where all kinds of companies think about how this might be helpful to their portfolios, but as Owen said it is not going to displace the business that we are in. And we are very comfortable that we can work cooperatively with these types of users in a symbiotic way.","James Feldman","Do you have any thoughts on how much larger the sector can become? I know you have mentioned that kind of less than 5% to most markets.","Doug Linde","Well, so I think its market dependent right. I used an example of San Francisco and in San Francisco there just over call it 3 million square feet of space. There is no availability there are no blocks of space. If they wanted to double in size they would have to take every single block of space that is coming available in the next year two years three years in order to get there and that\u2019s just not going to happen. Similarly, in Boston it\u2019s a very competitive market and so it's just going to be really, really hard for them to grow in a meaningful way relative to the percentage of the market. So I think it's going to be different market by market. Bryan, do you any thoughts on that?","Bryan Koop","Yes, I think part of it is also identification of product bifurcations. So for example the traditional co-working is different than enterprise leasing in the smaller spaces without the community aspects to it. So it's almost a totally different product and what's taken place out there is everybody is lumping everything together and it creates some illusions that you probably are not necessary in terms of the size and scope. So a lot of this has to do by defining what the product is. So as an example with our flex product we don't have the community managers, we are not looking to provide additional services. It's just highly flexible space that\u2019s a shorter-term lease and that's quite different than other products. So a lot of it has to do with their business lumping everything together.","James Feldman","And then, we have seen a lot of large leases from tech and media companies in the last couple of years. What gives you comfort that the space that they will use and we are not seeing excessive expansion here?","Doug Linde","So Jaime, in comparison to 1999 to 2001 year in the dotcom era, the companies that are taking down the space are what we refer to in our small circle is tech tightened and these companies which have multifaceted businesses, multifaceted growth aspirations, and they are hiring people at enormous rates. And so, they are filling their space as quickly as they can get it. And interestingly what is going on is that they are looking to find those locations that are closest where the talent is and where they can attract the talent.","And just as again sort of to talk about Downtown San Jose, the reason that side is so interesting to us today and remember that we do have another site in Downtown San Jose that we have owned for 20 years and we haven\u2019t gotten going yet. So, this was the double down in Downtown San Jose, is that the idea that companies are going to put their employees that are living in the city of San Francisco, put them on coach boxes and have them travel down to 280 or the 101 for up to three hours a day of the commute it's just becoming really tired.","And so having the ability to have a transit oriented location, where they can get on the Caltrain Bullet stop in San Francisco and be down in Downtown San Jose in about an hour is a very, very attractive preposition, and Google has also made a commitment to build housing and retail and also some other things. So, it was going to become a really interesting Downtown. And our view is that the market has really changed down there. And so what was once going to be an 800 plus thousand square foot either office or residential site at the Plaza at Almaden, we are now permitting for a minimum of 1.3 million square feet and could be larger than that.","The parking ratios have changed. The use of trifurcation has changed and we just think these are the types of locations where companies are going to go. And you\u2019ve obviously seen Amazon and Google and Facebook make tremendous piece of the base acquisitions across their marketplaces, not just in Silicon Valley, but in Los Angeles and in Austin and in Boston and in Washington DC. And we just -- we\u2019re comfortable with these companies are long-term growth organizations that are going to be very aggressive about hiring talent to feed their businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garrick Johnston from Deutsche Bank.","Garrick Johnston","How was the entitlement process for new CBD development currently shaping out by market? And I was wondering if you had experience any deltas notable we're sharing?","Doug Linde","So, do you have half hour 45 minutes, that\u2019s how long will take to answer that question. Why don't I let Bob Pester talk about what\u2019s going on in San Francisco. Obviously, with our site at Fort Harrison and at the CBD site, and then I'll let Bryan talk about, what\u2019s going on at Back Bay in Boston, Boston because those are sort of the two entitlement opportunities that are in front of us right now.","Garrick Johnston","In San Francisco, the Central SoMa plan was proved and immediately there were four lawsuits filed which all are CEQA land suits, which pretty much will put everything on hold unless they are settled or someone could elect to go ahead and be subject to whatever happens in the lawsuits. San Francisco continues to be probably one of the most difficult markets in the United States to get entitled in, and other than the 6 Central SoMa sites that are called super sites. The Giants Mission Rock in Pier 70, there is not a lot on the horizon as far as feature development in San Francisco of any significance.","Doug Linde","So in Boston, our project in the Back Bay is probably most significant on the commercial side. We do have some residential components to it and we see that to be at least the couple more years of permitting. But not having to do with anything other than that\u2019s the process and it\u2019s a complicated site over a transportation hub. So the Back Bay has limited amount of foreseeable, will say product line coming on in the commercial side. And that goes for Cambridge as well. We are seeing as it was noted earlier a real discipline amongst the developers who have states that are permitted and all seem to be conditioned on preleasing as well.","Garrick Johnston","And just last one for me. It was interesting to see the land acquisition at Carnegie Center in Princeton. I was wondering, if you just share some further thoughts on the suburban addition? And I'm assuming this would be a preleased type of development perhaps life sciences, anymore inflow there would be interesting?","Doug Linde","When Boston Properties bought Carnegie Center 20 years ago, we bought the buildings and we got plus option to purchase the site. And over the years, we have purchased a handful of the sites and done build the suites for customers. That option expired last year. So we were faced with the decision on whether to let the option expire or to exercise and purchase all the land part. So we access -- we obviously elected the latter. So we do have all this land, we acknowledge Princeton is not our fastest growing market.","That all being said we do have some uses for the land. So for example, right now we have a customer parking need that we're going to satisfy with the -- with one of the lots that repurchase, we anticipate our ability to sell some of these individual paths which we will do, but perhaps most importantly, our perspective is our investment in Carnegie center is more valuable with the buildings and the development opportunity, unified rather than as they are being separated and that was a key driver of the division.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So two questions, first, just sort of continuing on the Princeton theme. Mike, you spoke about getting exciting, fully exciting Annapolis Junction. Princeton, it sounds like you may exit as well or you may keep. But as you outline your guidance for this year, is there a certain amount of dispositions that's in their meaning if you fully exited Annapolis Junction or anything else, does that impact your guys ability to deliver on your growth this year? Or is there some potential that dispositions could disrupt what you guys have laid out?","Owen Thomas","Alex, I am going to answer the former and I'll let Mike jump in on the latter. So, we have no current plans to exit our Princeton investment. We do think purchasing this land for the reasons I just outline on the last question, we think our investment in the whole project is more valuable by owning the land, but we have no near term plans at exit it. That all being said a week intend in 2019 to continue with our non-core asset disposition plan and again we haven't finalized our exact list this year, but I would anticipate that it will revert back to levels of '16 and '17, which would be and accounted to $250 million maybe $300 million sales in 2019.","Mike LaBelle","And Alex, as reflected in guidance as I mentioned in my call notes. We haven't included anything additional other than what's in our release for asset sales within our guidance. So some of what were selling as Owen said is non-core some of it is land parcel that we don\u2019t think we're going to develop, so we really don\u2019t have a meaningful impact. Than a lot of the other non-core stuff you're talking about is kind of suburban stuff that is not that big.","So, yes, some of it does have NOI that would come out so we're going to get cash and we would deploy that cash so that would help and it would reduce our line of credit usage. So there is kind of both sides of it and without knowing exactly which assets there are we think it was inappropriate thing to do that kind of put up ex amount in the guidance. We would rather just say there is nothing in the guidance and give us time to think kind of things we are thinking about. But I don't think it would have a meaningful its not going to be huge, its not going to have a meaningful impact.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is sort of continuing the co-working theme. Dock 72 initially takes occupancy in the second quarter of this year, still only 33% leased. It's one sort of outlier in your New York portfolio. Presumably, you want to lease it up before assessing what your options are with it. But as you stand today, what are your thoughts on keeping that versus selling it as I say, it stands out versus the rest your portfolio in New York?","Owen Thomas","So Alex, we have no plans to sell Dock 72. Our current focus as you suggest is certainly leasing the asset and that\u2019s what we are focused on now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.","Tom Catherwood","A quick question on New York and then Reston; In New York, Mike or I think Doug, I appreciate your commentary as far as leases over $100 a square foot. You mentioned though obviously the slower demand when it goes over $120 a square foot. What are you seeing as far as interest in and options for your vacant space at 767 Fifth?","Owen Thomas","So, John, do you want to take that.","John Powers","Yes, well, we think the market last year was really hot 32.4 million. We haven\u2019t had a year like that in New York since 2000. So, this is really a lot of momentum. And notwithstanding the equity market jitters at the end of December, having talk now to a number of brokers and looking at the market, things still do you rolling along. So, we are optimistic about what's happening at GM, but we do have competition coming on place during the year. 425 Park is going to be a great building and 550 Madison the top floors are going to be good. But we think the product is still outstanding the best in the market and we are starting to work on those blocks that are coming up in '19, '20 now.","Tom Catherwood","And then, John, maybe one more on the GM building, anymore clarity as far as the timing of the ins and outs for the retail portion?","John Powers","Yes, we are working very hard with Apple on the Apple Store, and we don't have a date, but certainly that date will be sometime in the first half of this year. And we are working also with Under Armour because Apple is the temp store now and wants to stay there and we work things with Under Armour. So that will work for them although the Under Armour still will be delayed, resulting as the result of the Apple staying in the temp store. And we do have some Cartier left of course and we do have some interest in that space, and we think just something there in the first half of this year.","Tom Catherwood","And then just quick one on Reston. Doug, I think you mentioned a place making project down in the town center and making some improvements there. What were you referencing to? And do you have a sense of what that cost impact could be?","Doug Linde","Peter, do you want to take that?","Peter Johnston","Sure, so, this has been going on for probably in terms of design and rebranding of the lower year. And in the next quarter or so, we\u2019re going to start the actual physical improvements. We have done a few minor ones. To a lot of the public around, through the Town Center there\u2019s a few been there, there is a number of larger public open venues, the pavilion area around the fountain et cetera. And I would say over the course of probably the next 24 months, we\u2019re looking at investment that\u2019s probably plus or minus in the $3 million. We\u2019re also in the Fountain Square buildings which the original office building already underway with redoing those lobbies which were ready for the refresh that is 25 plus years old. So, I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors.","Daniel Ismail","Just a bigger picture question on the utilization space by your tenants. One of your peers in some recent years articles have suggested that the justification trends of the last few years may have over short the mark. Curious what are you seeing in your end portfolio with respect a new or renewal leases? And how you guys are planning for new developments in terms of space per employee?","Owen Thomas","So, why don't start with Bryan and then if any of the other guys want to chime in, they should do that.","Bryan Koop","Yes, one of the things that ties with the question about how clients are using their space earlier, was that the sophistication with these clients are working with the great examples of Verizon, is incredible versus let\u2019s say the year 2000 when you had growth from tech companies that were gabling down space and really didn\u2019t have an idea of their utilization, their growth rates et cetera. What we\u2019re finding across the board is the sophistication of the users is very knowledgeable of how they are use that, how much space they\u2019re going to use it, and its far more accurate in terms of their needs. So because of that we can shift that also been a great discipline that\u2019s been added to the market and then you add that with the shock absorbers that Doug mentioned in terms of how they are using some of the these shorter term space. I think it's really healthy.","Owen Thomas","Bob, you might want to describe how everyone has been building out Salesforce Tower, right. Because it\u2019s the newest sort of CBD building that we have and how their \"program\" has worked.","Bob Pester","The build out varies the tenant on the type of the tenant that I can say in the case, Salesforce it's all been seeding for the most part and they're about a 160 square feet per employee. I know that they have relaxed their requirement as far as trying to get tighter than that. Initially, I think they were targeting a 120 when Ford Fish was there renting the real estate department.","Daniel Ismail","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just staying in San Francisco, have you guys noticed with I know it's only about a month in 2018, but any impacts on proposition fee either on the tenant side or near and if your ability to push through that increase on new leasing?","Owen Thomas","Yes, I would respond that. We haven\u2019t seen any pushback from tenants on that and we haven\u2019t seen any tenants that leave the market based on -.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question is a follow-up question from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Thanks for taking follow-up guys. Just Doug or John, could you just run through your rent growth expectations throughout the different submarkets of New York?","Doug Linde","John, you want to start?","John Powers","Rent growth in submarkets of New York. So, first, when we say, we don't have a lot of space to lease. So, if you are talking about our buildings, there is only a few building -- few pieces of space that we have to look at. I think will do well at GM and will have some rent close there clearly the block we have left at 399 there will be wrinkles there and that's probably states that over a $100 a foot. 159 is all leased and I guess when we look at the base of 510, I would say will definitely have rent growth there over the deal we've had in place.","Owen Thomas","Okay, I think that completes all of our questions. Thank you everyone for your interest in Boston Properties.","Operator","This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have good day."]}}
